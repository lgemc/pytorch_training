The past tense refers to actions or events that have already happened in the past. The perfect modifier is used to indicate that an action was completed before another action in the past or to emphasize the result of a past action.

For example, \\'I had finished my homework before dinner\\' or \\'She has already left for work.\\'\",\\n\\n\"examples\": [\"I had studied for the test before I went to bed last night.\", \"He had already eaten breakfast by the time I woke up.\", \"They have finished their project and are now celebrating.\"]\\n\\n}'}"
