(--)-alpha-Bisabolol has a primary antipeptic action depending on dosage, which is not caused by an alteration of the pH-value. The proteolytic activity of pepsin is reduced by 50 percent through addition of bisabolol in the ratio of 1/0.5. The antipeptic action of bisabolol only occurs in case of direct contact. In case of a previous contact with the substrate, the inhibiting effect is lost.\n"

      "[Demonstration of tumor inhibiting properties of a strongly immunostimulating low-molecular weight substance. Comparative studies with ifosfamide on the immuno-labile DS carcinosarcoma. Stimulation of the autoimmune activity for approx. 20 days by BA 1, a N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea. Novel prophylactic possibilities]. A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104. Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1. The thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising.\n",
      "Effect of etafenone on total and regional myocardial blood flow. The distribution of blood flow to the subendocardial, medium and subepicardial layers of the left ventricular free wall was studied in anaesthetized dogs under normoxic (A), hypoxic (B) conditions and under pharmacologically induced (etafenone) coronary vasodilation (C). Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.\n",
      "Influence of a new virostatic compound on the induction of enzymes in rat liver. The virostatic compound N,N-diethyl-4-[2-(2-oxo-3-tetradecyl-1-imidazolidinyl)-ethyl]-1-piperazinecarboxamide-hydrochloride (5531) was analyzed as to its effect on the induction of tryptophan-pyrrolase and tyrosineaminotransferase in rat liver. 1. The basic activity of the enzymes was not influenced by the substance either in normal or in adrenalectomized animals. 2. The induction of the enzymes by cortisone increased in the presence of the compound whereas the substrate induction remained unchanged. 3. The induction of tyrosine-aminotransferase by dexamethasonephosphate in tissue culture is inhibited if the dose of compound 5531 is higher than 5 mug/ml.\n",
      "Pharmacological properties of new neuroleptic compounds. RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are newly synthetized N-[8-R-dibenzo(b,f)oxepin-10-yl]-N'-methyl-piperazine-maleates which show interesting psychopharmacologic effects. This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.\n",
      "[Studies on the action of an anticholinergic agent in combination with a tranquilizer on gastric juice secretion in man]. A double-blind study with intra-individual comparisons was carried out to investigate the effects of 15 mg of (8r)-3alpha-hydroxy-8-isopropyl-1alphaH-tropanium bromide(+/-)-tropate (Sch 1000), 15 mg Sch 1000 + 10 mg oxazepam, 10 mg oxazepam and placebo with oral administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume, amount of acid, concentration and pH values in 12 healthy volunteers. The secretion parameters were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid, although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period. The pH value was savely increased only by Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period. The results are discussed.\n",
      "Lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis. I. Glycosidases. Seven distinct glycosidases (EC 3.2) have been characterized in guinea-pig epidermis. Their properties indicate them to be of lysosomal origin. The 'profile' of the epidermal glycosidases is significantly different from that reported for whole skin, the activities of beta-galactosidase and beta-acetylglucosaminidase being very high and those of the remaining enzymes relatively low in epidermis.\n",
      "Lysosomal hydrolases of the epidermis. 2. Ester hydrolases. Five distinct ester hydrolases (EC 3-1) have been characterized in guinea-pig epidermis. These are carboxylic esterase, acid phosphatase, pyrophosphatase, and arylsulphatase A and B. Their properties are consistent with those of lysosomal enzymes.\n",
      "A serum haemagglutinating property dependent upon polycarboxyl groups. A serum agglutinin reactive with red cells in the presence of polycarboxyl groups is reported. It is likely that this represents an additional example of the type of agglutinin previously described as agglutinating red cells in the absence of ionized calcium. Experimental evidence is presented indicating that it is free polycarboxyl groups that potentiate agglutination and that any metal ion, such as calcium, capable of chelating with these groups will prove to be inhibitory.\n",
      "Effect of human erythrocyte stromata on complement activation. Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum test. The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same factor could be responsible for both activities. Stromata and peaks also induce lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway. This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic observation. When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced. This would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway. The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.\n",
      "The effect of o-salicylate upon pentose phosphate pathway activity in normal and G6PD-deficient red cells. The effect of the major metabolite of aspirin, namely salicylic acid, upon the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of normal and G6PD-deficient red cells has been studied. Salicylic acid was shown to inhibit this pathway in proportion to the amount present. At any concentration of this substance there was greater inhibition of the PPP in G6PD-deficient than in normal red cells.\n",
      "The effects of processing of barley-based supplements on rumen pH, rate of digestion of voluntary intake of dried grass in sheep. 1. In one experiment the effect on rumen pH of feeding with restricted amounts of whole or pelleted barley was studied. With whole barley there was little variation in rumen pH associated with feeding time, but with pelleted barley the pH decreased from about 7-0 before feeding to about 5-3, 2--3 h after feeding. 2. The rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment. After 24 h incubation only 423 mg/g incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 mg/g incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley. 3. The voluntary intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they received supplements of either 25 or 50 g whole or pelleted barley/kg live weight 0-75. At the high level, pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534 g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg. The digestibility of acid-detergent fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to processing. 4. The implications of these findings on supplementation of roughages with cereals are discussed.\n",
      "Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid): formation of ordered self-structures and interaction with poly(cytidylic acid). Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of high stability. The 8-amino group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds between two residues along the \"top\", or long axis, of the purines. The usual hydrogen bonding protons and Watson-Crick pairing sites are not involved in the association. The bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is hemiprotonated at N(7). Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range approximately pH 10-11. The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar, tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding. Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated G-G self-structure. Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix. In contrast to the monomer 8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any conditions. The properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of a strong tendency of the 8-amino group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond, when this possibility is not prevented by high pH.\n",
      "Effect of pH on substrate and inhibitor kinetic constants of human liver alanine aminopeptidase. Evidence for two ionizable active center groups. The presence of at least two ionizable active center groups has been detected by a study of the effect of pH upon catalysis of hydrolysis of L-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide by human liver alanine aminopeptidase and upon the inhibition of hydrolysis by inhibitors and substrate analogs. Octanoic acid, octylamine, and peptide inhibitors have been found to be competitive inhibitors and are therefore thought to bind the active center. L-Phe was previously shown to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates (Garner, C. W., and Behal, F. J. (1975), Biochemistry 14, 3208). A plot of pKm vs. pH for the substrate L-Ala-beta-naphthylamide showed that binding decreased below pH 5.9 and above 7.5, the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in slope. These points are interpreted as the pKa either of substrate ionizable groups or binding-dependent enzyme active center groups. Similar plots of pKm vs. pH for L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide (as substrate) and pKi vs. pH for L-Leu-L-Leu-L-Leu and D-Leu-L-Tyr (as inhibitors) gave pairs fo pKa values of 5.8 and 7.4, 6.0 and 7.5, and 5.7 and 7.5, respectively. All the above substrates (and D-Leu-L-Tyr) have pKa values near 7.5; therefore, the binding-dependent group with a pKa value near 7.5 is possibly this substrate group. Similar plots of pKi vs. pH for the inhibitors L-Phe, L-Met, L-Leu, octylamine, and octanoic acid had only one bending point at 7.7, 7.6, 7.4, 6.3, and 5.9, respectively. Amino acid inhibitors, octylamine, and octanoic acid have no groups with pKa values between 5 and 9. These data indicate that there are two active center ionizable groups with pKa values of approximately 6.0 and 7.5 which are involved in substrate binding or inhibitory amino acid binding but not in catalysis since Vmax was constant at all pH values tested.\n",
      "Formation of transient complexes in the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction. The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.\n",
      "Human brain and placental choline acetyltransferase: purification and properties. Choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the biosynthesis of acetylcholine according to the following chemical equation: acetyl-CoA + choline in equilibrium to acetylcholine + CoA. In addition to nervous tissue, primate placenta is the only other animal source which contains appreciable acetylcholine and its biosynthetic enzyme. Human brain caudate nucleus and human placental choline acetyltransferase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using ion-exchange and blue dextran-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The molecular weights determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis are 67000 plus or minus 3000. N-Ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibit the enzyme. Dithiothreitol reverses the inhibition produced by the latter two reagents. The pKa of the group associated with N-ethylmaleimide inhibition is 8.6 plus or minus 0.3. A chemically competent acetyl-thioenzyme is isolable by Sephadex gel filtration. The enzymes from the brain and placenta are thus far physically and biochemically indistinguishable.\n",
      "Stabilization of the globular structure of ferricytochrome c by chloride in acidic solvents. Increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification of ferricytochrome c. Analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pK of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and an intrinsic pK of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation. Analysis of methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion, most likely a heme propionate residue, is responsible for displacement of the methionine ligand. Addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pK of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a globular conformation into a random coil. It is most likely that the second protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself. Chloride is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination position of the heme ion. Such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of ferricytochrome c at pH 0.0 and 25 degrees.\n",
      "A competitive labeling method for the determination of the chemical properties of solitary functional groups in proteins. The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as built-in-probes of the structure of the protein. We have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary functional groups in proteins may be determined. The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein. The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein. The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1. In addition, the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these functional groups, and indicate that the proteins studied undergo pH-dependent conformational changes which affect the microenvironment, and hence the chemical reactivity of these groups.\n",
      "Modification of arginine and lysine in proteins with 2,4-pentanedione. Primary amines react with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 6-9 to form enamines, N-alkyl-4-amino-3-penten-2-ones. The latter compounds readily regenerate the primary amine at low pH or on treatment with hydroxylamine. Guanidine and substituted guanidines react with 2,4-pentanedione to form N-substituted 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 20 than the rate of reaction of 2,4-pentanedione with primary amines. Selective modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be achieved with 2,4-pentanedione. Modification of lysine is favored by reaction at pH 7 or for short reaction times at pH 9. Selective modification of arginine is achieved by reaction with 2,4-pentanedione for long times at pH 9, followed by treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine. The extent of modification of lysine and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 7 results in modification of 3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 9 results in modification of 4 lysine residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr. Treatment of this modified protein with hydroxylamine regenerated the modified lysine residues but caused no change in the modified arginine residues. One arginine residue seems to be essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.\n",
      "The origin of the alkaline inactivation of pepsinogen. Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to pepsin on exposure to low pH. Intermediate exposure to neutral pH, however, returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is presented for a reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion.\n",
      "Bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase: purification and properties of the enzyme. A purification procedure is reported for obtaining bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase in high yield and amounts of 100-200 mg. A key step in the procedure is the use of an affinity gel prepared by coupling pteroyl-L-lysine to Sepharose. The purified reductase has a specific activity of about 100 units/mg and is homogeneous as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and titration with methotrexate. The products of the first step of Edman degradation indicated a minimum purity of 79%. The reductase has a molecular weight of about 21500 on the basis of amino acid composition and 22100 +/- 300 from equilibrium sedimentation. It is not inhibited by antiserum to the Streptococcus faecium reductase (isoenzyme 2). Unlike the reductase of many other vertebrate tissues, the bovine enzyme is inhibited by mercurials rather than activated and it has a single pH optimum at both low and high ionic strength. However, the position of the pH optimum is shifted and the activity increased by increasing ionic strength. Automatic Edman degradation has been used to determine 34 of the amino-terminal 37 amino acid residues. Considerable homology exists between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from S. faecium and from Escherichia coli. This strengthens the idea that this region contributes to the structure of the binding site for dihydrofolate.\n",
      "Purification and properties of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 40-fold to apparent homogeneity from a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (RT 500) using a procedure that includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography. Determinations of the molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition, sedimentation velocity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave values of 17680, 17470 and 18300, respectively. An aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel filtration; treatment of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer. Also, multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima (pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with dihydrofolate as a substrate. Highest activities are observed in buffers containing large organic cations. In 100 mM imidazolium chloride (pH 7), the specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at 30 degrees. Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH optimum of pH 4.5. At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is 1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate. Monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation. Divalent cations are more potent inhibitors; the I50 of BaCl2 is 250 muM, as compared to 125 mM for KCl. Anions neither inhibit nor activate the enzyme.\n",
      "The influence of pH on the interaction of inhibitors with triosephosphate isomerase and determination of the pKa of the active-site carboxyl group. Ionization effects on the binding of the potential transition state analogues 2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phosphoglycolohydroxamate appear to be attributable to the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves, therefore it is unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the active site of triosephosphate isomerase to explain the influence of changing pH on Ki in the neutral range. The binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing pH in the neutral range. 3-Chloroacetol sulfate, synthesized as an active-site-specific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase, is used to provide an indication of the pKa of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme. Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization (accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation. Being a strong monoprotic acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of the carboxyl group. Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier. From the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1.\n",
      "Monoanion inhibition and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance studies of renal dipeptidase. Kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and 15Cl nuclear magnetic resonance at 5.88 MHz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc metalloenzyme, renal dipeptidase. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, nitrate, or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the divalent anion, sulfate. Competitive inhibition was produced by these anions. One anion was bound per enzyme molecule, and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site. Cyanide ion produced a much more effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions, and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule. An investigation of the effect of pH upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pK of approximately 7.8. Complete dissociation of this group (approximately pH 8.4) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 M NaCl solutions was 100 times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozinc(II). The line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation. When zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide, line broadening was decreased. Treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor, guanosine triphosphate, in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl also produced a significant decrease in the 35Cl line width. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing pH through the range pH 5.8-10.8. This line-width variation with pH appeared to result from the titration of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pK of 7.4. Temperature studies of 35Cl line broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant relaxation mechanism is quadrupolar in nature.\n",
      "The interaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with hydrogen peroxide: inactivation of the enzyme. Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated by hydrogen peroxide. The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent, Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.\n",
      "Circular dichroism and fluorescence studies of homogeneous antibodies to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. The near-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) of three homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibodies in the absence and the presence of the specific hexasaccharide ligand was studied. In addition recombinations and hybridizations of H and L chains derived from two of these antibodies were carried out and the CD spectra of bound and free reconstituted IgG molecules were measured. The results indicate that the CD spectra of the native antibodies in the 260-310-nm range are very similar in shape and sign and exhibit a positive band at 285 nm. The homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited CD spectra very similar in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules are no longer stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. Upon addition of the hexasaccharide ligand, a significant decrease in amplitude of the CD spectra (18-21%) occurred in all three native antibodies and their Fab fragments as well as in the homologous recombinant molecules. No CD spectral changes could be detected upon interaction of the hapten ligand with the heterologous recombinants. All homogeneous antibodies studied exhibited fluorescence quenching upon oligosaccharide binding and a blue shift of the emission maximum. This property allowed the determination of the binding constant of one selected antibody to be made. Taken together, CD and fluorescence spectroscopic data suggest that oligosaccharide ligands induced detectable conformational changes in the Fab fragment of the antibody.\n",
      "Conformational changes induced in a homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibody by oligosaccharides of increasing size. The circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligand-induced structural changes in a homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody. A series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed. Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational changes was decreased. This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen binding. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur. Small monovalent ligands, i.e., the tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides, were capable of inducing CPL changes in the Fab part of the antibody molecule as well as CPL changes attributed to the Fc portion. A multivalent ligand containing about 16 sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the Fc part, similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen.\n",
      "Evidence of the involvement of a 50S ribosomal protein in several active sites. The functional role of the Bacillus stearothermophilus 50S ribosomal protein B-L3 (probably homologous to the Escherichia coli protein L2) was examined by chemical modification. The complex [B-L3-23S RNA] was photooxidized in the presence of rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into 50S ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components. Particles containing photooxidized B-L3 are defective in several functional assays, including (1) poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis, (2) peptidyltransferase activity, (3) ability to associate with a [30S-poly(U)-Phe-tRNA] complex, and (4) binding of elongation factor G and GTP. The rates of loss of the partial functional activities during photooxidation of B-L3 indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring, a faster one, involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase and subunit association activities and a slower one affecting EF-G binding. Therefore the protein B-L3 has one or more histidine residues which are essential for peptidyltransferase and subunit association, and another residue which is essential for EF-G-GTP binding. B-L3 may be the ribosomal peptidyltransferase protein, or a part of the active site, and may contribute functional groups to the other active sites as well.\n",
      "The interaction of phospholipase A2 with micellar interfaces. The role of the N-terminal region. The localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site (IRS) in porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required for a specific interaction between the enzyme and organized lipid-water interfaces, was investigated by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the unique Trp residue, and by protection experiments against specific tryptic hydrolysis. Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion. At alkaline pH, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.\n",
      "Phospholipase A2 as a probe of phospholipid distribution in erythrocyte membranes. Factors influencing the apparent specificity of the reaction. The action of snake venom phospholipases A2 in intact human erythrocytes was investigated in detail. The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell hemolysis under certain experimental conditions. The hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70% of the total cell ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b) complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine, followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis, attack on the phosphatidylserine. At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage (a) occurred. However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions. An investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels were lowered. Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in influx of Ca2+ into the cell when the levels of ATP are low. Interestingly the phosphllipase from Naja naja venom (Pakistan) yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from Agkistrodon venom. However, the enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the Agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied. Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells. Pig, monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis. It is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of phospholipds in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution. Certain facets of this problem are discussed.\n",
      "Subunit interactions in yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The spontaneous inactivation of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to fit a simple two-state model at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees. The first step is a relatively rapid dissociation of the tetramer to dimers with the equilibrium largely in favor of the tetramer. In the absence of NAD+ the dimer inactivates irreversibly. The apoenzyme is quite stable with a half-life for complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration. Perturbances of the protein structure (by pH, ionic strength, and specific salts), which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule, result in an alteration of the cooperativity of NAD+ binding, the reactivity of the active-site sulfhydryl group, and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Covalent modification of two of the four active-site sulfhydryl groups has profound effects on the enzymic activity which are mediated by changes in the subunit interactions. Sedimentation analysis and hybridization studies indicate that the interaction between subunits remains strong after covalent modification. Under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a tetramer. Equilibrium dialysis studies of NAD+ binding to the enzyme at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern. A model consistent with these observations and the observed half-of-the-sites reactivity is that of ligand induced sequential conformational changes which are transferred across strongly interacting subunit domains. Methods for distinguishing negatively cooperative binding patterns from mixtures of denatured enzyme and multiple species are discussed.\n",
      "Kinetic light scattering studies on the dissociation of hemoglobin from Lumbricus terrestris. The kinetics of the pH-induced dissociation of the 3 X 10(6) mol wt hemoglobin from Lumbricus terrestris (the earthworm) have been studied in a light-scattering stopped-flow apparatus. The ligand dependent dissociation data were fit well by a simple sequential model. The data for CO and oxyhemoglobin are consistent with Hb12 leads to 2Hb6 leads to 12Hb. Methemoglobin at pH 7 appears to be hexameric and the dissociation is consistent with the model: Hb6 leads to 6Hb. In a sequential decay scheme for which light-scattering changes are monitored, the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species. Assignment of the hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates. This assignment is further supported by the following: (1) the same model will fit the data for oxy- and CO-hemoglobin at all three temperatures (a 24-29-fold variation in rate constants), (2) evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms, and (3) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at pH 7. When CO replaces O2 as the ligand, the dissociation rate increases by a factor of four. The met is about 20 times faster than the initial oxyhemoglobin dissociation rate, but perhaps more relevant for comparing dissociation of the hexamer, the met rate was respectively 100 times and 500 times faster than that for the assumed hexameric forms of CO- and oxy-hemoglobin. The activation energies for the dodecamer to hexamer dissociation and for the dissociation of the hexamer to smaller forms were about 30 kcal/mol for oxy-, CO-, and methemoglobin.\n",
      "The reversible reduction of horse metmyoglobin by the iron(II) complex of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N,n-tetraacetate. The reduction of metmyoglobin by the iron(II) complex of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetate (FeCDTA2-) has been investigated. The equilibrium constant, measured spectrophotometrically, is 0.21 with a resulting reduction potential of 0.050 V for Mb0. The rate constant for the reduction is 28 M-1 sec-1 with a deltaH ++ of 13 kcal M-1 and deltaS ++ of -11 eu. Both CN- and OH- inhibit the reduction because of the relatively low reactivity of cyanometmyoglobin (Mb+CN-) and ionized metmyglobin (Mb+OH-). The rate constant for the reduction of Mb+CN- by FeCDTA2- is 4.0 X 10(-2) M-1 sec-1 and that for reduction of Mb+OH- is 4.8 M-1 sec-1. The nitric oxide complex of metmyoglobin is reduced with a rate constant of 10 M-1 sec-1. The kinetics of oxidation of oxymyoglobin by FeCDTA- were studied. The data are consistent with a mechanism where oxidation takes place entirely through the deoxy form. A rate constant of 1.45 X 10(2) M-1 sec-1 was calculated for the oxidation of deoxymyoglobin by FeCDTA-, in equilibrium constant and rate constant for reduction. The above data are discussed in terms of a simple outer-sphere reduction reaction.\n",
      "Constitution and properties of axonal membranes of crustacean nerves. The purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in Na+, K+-ATPase activity. A characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic membranes. The axonal membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, and tubulin-like proteins. It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. The molecular weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are 280,000 and 270,000, respectively. The molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for ATPase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase. We confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find [3H]nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes. The binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel, has been studied in detail. The dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4. The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane. A reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane. Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane. [3H]Veratridine binding to membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect. Veratridine and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites. Although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine, veratridine does not affect the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes. Similarly, tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Scorpion neurotoxin I, a presynaptic toxin which affects both the Na+ and the K+ channels, does not interfere with the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin or [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Tetrodotoxin, veratridine, and scorpion neurotoxin I, which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of the sodium channel, act upon three different types of receptor sites.\n",
      "Regulation of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase-derepressed mutants of Klebsiella pneumoniae. 1. A new procedure is described for selecting nitrogenase-derepressed mutants based on the method of Brenchley et al. (Brenchley, J.E., Prival, M.J. and Magasanik, B. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6122-6128) for isolating histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium. 2. Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene.\n",
      "The reaction between the superoxide anion radical and cytochrome c. 1. The superoxide anion radical (O2-) reacts with ferricytochrome c to form ferrocytochrome c. No intermediate complexes are observable. No reaction could be detected between O2- and ferrocytochrome c. 2. At 20 degrees C the rate constant for the reaction at pH 4.7 to 6.7 is 1.4-10(6) M-1. S -1 and as the pH increases above 6.7 the rate constant steadily decreases. The dependence on pH is the same for tuna heart and horse heart cytochrome c. No reaction could be demonstrated between O2- and the form of cytochrome c which exists above pH approximately 9.2. The dependence of the rate constant on pH can be explained if cytochrome c has pKs of 7.45 and 9.2, and O2- reacts with the form present below pH 7.45 with k = 1.4-10(6) M-1 - S-1, the form above pH 7.45 with k = 3.0- 10(5) M-1 - S-1, and the form present above pH 9.2 with k = 0. 3. The reaction has an activation energy of 20 kJ mol-1 and an enthalpy of activation at 25 degrees C of 18 kJ mol-1 both above and below pH 7.45. It is suggested that O2- may reduce cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids, and that little protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the activated complex. 4. No reduction of ferricytochrome c by HO2 radicals could be demonstrated at pH 1.2-6.2 but at pH 5.3, HO2 radicals oxidize ferrocytochrome c with a rate constant of about 5-10(5)-5-10(6) M-1 - S-1.\n",
      "Identification of the 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence in spinach chloroplasts and subchloroplast particles as the intrinsic back reaction. The dependence of the level of this phase on the thylakoids internal pH. After a 500 mus laser flash a 120 mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence is visible under a variety of circumstances in spinach chloroplasts and subchloroplast particles enriched in Photosystem II prepared by means of digitonin. The level of this phase is high in the case of inhibition of oxygen evolution at the donor side of Photosystem II. Comparison with the results of Babcock and Sauer (1975) Biochim. Bio-phys. Acta 376, 329-344, indicates that their EPR signal IIf which they suppose to be due to Z+, the oxidized first secondary donor of Photosystem II, is well correlated with a large amplitude of our 120 mus phase. We explain our 120 mus phase by the intrinsic back reaction of the excited reaction center in the presence of Z+, as predicted by Van Gorkom and Donze (1973) Photochem. Photobiol. 17, 333-342. The redox state of Z+ is dependent on the internal pH of the thylakoids. The results on the effect of pH in the mus region are compared with those obtained in the ms region.\n",
      "Light-induced changes of absorbance and electron spin resonance in small photosystem II particles. Photosystem II reaction center components have been studied in small system II particles prepared with digitonin. Upon illumination the reduction of the primary acceptor was indicated by absorbance changes due to the reduction of a plastoquinone to the semiquinone anion and by a small blue shifts of absorption bands near 545 nm (C550) and 685 nm. The semiquinone to chlorophyll ratio was between 1/20 and 1/70 in various preparations. The terminal electron donor in this reaction did not cause large absorbance changes but its oxidized form was revealed by a hitherto unknown electron spin resonance (ESR) signal, which had some properties of the well-known signal II but a linewidth and g-value much nearer to those of signal I. Upon darkening absorbance and ESR changes decayed together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by 3-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. The donor could be oxidized by ferricyanide in the dark. Illumination in the presence of ferricyanide induced absorbance and ESR changes, rapidly reversed upon darkening, which may be ascribed to the oxidation of a chlorophyll a dimer, possibly the primary electron donor of photosystem II. In addition an ESR signal with 15 to 20 gauss linewidth and a slower dark decay was observed, which may have been caused by a secondary donor.\n",
      "Enzymic reactions of fatty acid hydroperoxides in extracts of potato tuber. II. Conversion of 9- and 13-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acids to monohydroxydienoic acid, epoxyhydroxy- and trihydroxymonoenoic acid derivatives. 1. Crude extracts and partially purified enzyme preparations from potato tubers catalyse, at pH 5-7, the conversion of linoleic acid hydroperoxides to a range of oxygenated fatty acid derivatives. 2. 9-D- and 13-L-hydroperoxide isomers are converted at similar rates to equivalent (isomeric) products. 3. The major products from the 13-hydroperoxide isomer were identified as the corresponding monohydroxydienoic acid derivative, threo-11-hydroxy-trans12,13-epoxy-octadec-cis9-enoic acid and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-octadec-trans10-enoic acid. The corresponding products from the 9-hydroperoxide were the monohydroxydienoic acid, 9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-octadec-12-enoic acid and 9,10,13-trihydroxy-octadec-11-enoic acid. 4. No separation of activities forming the different products was achieved by partial purification of enzyme extracts. 5. Product formation was unaffected by EDTA, CN-, sulphydryl reagents or glutathione but was reduced by boiling the extracts. 6. This system is compared with the 9-hydroperoxide-specific enzymic formation of divinyl ether derivatives by potato extracts.\n",
      "Partial purification and properties of microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from rat liver. Microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (phosphatidate phosphatase EC 3.1.3.4) was solubilized and fractionated to yield at least two distinct enzymatically active fractions. One, denoted FA, was non-specific, had a relatively high Km for phosphatidic acid and was insensitive to inhibition by diacylglycerol. The second fraction, FB, was specific for phosphatidates, had a low Km, and was inhibited, non-competitively, by diacylglycerol. FA exhibited a sigmoid substrate-activity curve. The isolated FB aggregated to particles of about 10(6) in the absence of salts and could be dissociated by the addition of monovalent cations at ionic strength 0.4-0.6 to about 2-10(5) daltons and thereby doubled its activity. Dissociation was time- and temperature-dependent. F- was inhibitory. Divalent ions were not required for the activity of FA or FB and inhibited at concentrations exceeding 1 mM.\n",
      "Bile acids. XLVII. 12alpha-Hydroxylation of precursors of allo bile acids by rabbit liver microsomes. Rabbit liver microsomal preparations fortified with 0.1 mM NADPH effectively promote hydroxylation of [3beta-3H]- or [24-14C]allochenodeoxycholic acid or [5alpha,6alpha-3H2]5alpha-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha-diol to their respective 12alpha-hydroxyl derivatives in yields of about 25 or 65% in 60 min. Minor amounts of other products are formed from the diol. The requirements for activity of rabbit liver microsomal 12alpha-hydroxylase resemble those of rat liver microsomes. Of a number of enzyme inhibitors studied only p-chloromercuribenzoate demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit the reaction with either tritiated substrate. There was no difference in the quantity of product produced from the tritiated acid or the 14C-labeled acid. No clear sex difference was found in activity of the enzyme, nor was an appreciable difference noted in activity of the enzyme between mature and immature animals.\n",
      "Partial purification and properties of a phenobarbital-induced aldehyde dehydrogenase of rat liver. Properties of the phenobarbital induced cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) have been studied in rat liver. 7-12-Fold higher levels were seen in the cytoplasmic activities after phenobarbital treatment in reactor compared to non-reactor animals with high concentrations of acetaldehyde (18 mM) and propionaldehyde (9 mM). No difference was found with 0.12 mM acetaldehyde, 2 mM glycolaldehyde, 6 mM formaldehyde or 0.5 mM betaine aldehyde. The reactor group also had slightly higher activity in the mitochondrial fraction with the high acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde concentrations. In the microsomal fraction, the activities showed no differences at any substrate concentration. An induced aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified 70-fold by chromatographic techniques. It had different molecular and enzymic properties than the main high-Km enzyme normally present in rat liver cytoplasm. The pI of the induced enzyme was about 7.0 as measured by isoelectric focusing. It was active with several aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes but not with formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde or D-glyceraldehyde. The Km-values for propionaldehyde and acetaldehyde were in the millimolar range. Millimolar concentrations of aromatic aldehydes caused a strong substrate inhibition. The enzyme was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of disulfiram. Estrone, deoxycorticosterone, progesterone and diethylstilbestrol also affected the enzyme activity.\n",
      "Cholinesterases from plant tissues. VI. Preliminary characterization of enzymes from Solanum melongena L. and Zea mays L. Enzymes capable of hydrolyzing esters of thiocholine have been assayed in extracts of Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) and Zea Mays L. (corn). The enzymes from both species are inhibited by the anti-cholinesterases neostigmine, physostigmine, and 284c51 and by AMO-1618, a plant growth retardant and they both have pH optima near pH 8.0. The enzyme from eggplant is maximally active at a substrate concentration of 0.15 mM acetylthiocholine and is inhibited at higher substrate concentrations. On the basis of this last property, the magnitude of inhibition by the various inhibitors, and the substrate specificity, we conclude that the enzyme from eggplant, but not that from corn, is a cholinesterase.\n",
      "Behavior of soluble and immobilized acid phosphatase in hydro-organic media. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate by wheat germ acid phosphatase (orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.2) has been investigated in mixtures of aqueous buffers with acetone, dioxane and acetonitrile. The enzyme was either in free solution or immobilized on a pellicular support which consisted of a porous carbonaceous layer on solid glass beads. The highest enzyme activity was obtained in acetone and acetonitrile mixed with citrate buffer over a wide range of organic solvent concentration. In 50% (v/v) acetone both V and Km of the immobilized enzyme were about half of the values in the neat aqueous buffer, but the Ki for inorganic phosphate was unchanged. In 50% (v/v) mixtures of various solvents and citrate buffers of different pH, the enzymic activity was found to depend on the pH of the aqueous buffer component rather than the pH of the hydro-organic mixture as measured with the glass-calomel electrode. The relatively high rates of p-nitrophenol liberation in the presence of glucose even at high organic solvent concentrations suggest that transphosphorylation is facilitated at low water activity.\n",
      "Purification and some enzymatic properties of the chitosanase from Bacillus R-4 which lyses Rhizopus cell walls. A strain of Bacillus sp (Bacillus R-4) produces a protease and a carbohydrolase both of which have the ability to lyse Rhizopus cell walls. Of the enzymes, the carbohydrolase has been purified to an ultracentrifugally and electrophoretically homogeneous state, and identified as a chitosanase. The enzyme was active on glycol chitosan as well as chitosan. Molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated as 31 000 and isoelectric point as pH 8.30. The enzyme was most active at pH 5.6 and at 40 degrees C with either Rhizopus cell wall or glycol chitosan as substrate, and was stable over a range of pH 4.5 to 7.5 at 40 degrees C for 3 h. The activity was lost by sulfhydryl reagents and restored by either reduced glutathione of L-cysteine. An abrupt decrease in viscosity of the reaction mixture suggested an endowise cleavage of chitosan by this enzyme.\n",
      "Specificity studies on alpha-mannosidases using oligosaccharides from mannosidosis urine as substrates. Oligosaccharides containing terminal non-reducing alpha(1 leads to 2)-, alpha(1 leads to 3)-, and alpha(1 leads to 6)-linked mannose residues, isolated from human and bovine mannosidosis urines were used as substrates to test the specificities of acidic alpha-mannosidases isolated from human and bovine liver. The enzymes released all the alpha-linked mannose residues from each oligosaccharide and were most effective on the smallest substrate. Enzyme A in each case was less active on the oligosaccharides than alpha-mannosidase B2, even though the apparent Km value for the substrates was the same with each enzyme. The human acidic alpha-mannosidases were also found to be more active on substrates isolated from human rather than bovine mannosidosis urine. Human alpha-mannosidase C, which has a neutral pH optimum when assayed with a synthetic substrate, did not hydrolyse any of the oligosaccharides at neutral pH, but was found to be active at an acidic pH.\n",
      "Calcium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase in the microsomal fraction of tooth germ from porcine fetus. The characterization and localization of a Ca(2+)-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) in the tooth germ of the porcine fetus are reported. This enzyme, a microsome fraction, is preferentially activated by Ca(2+). In the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, maximal enzyme activity is obtained at 0.5--1.0 mM CaCl2. The maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis is approx. 20 mumol per h per mg of protein as the enzyme preparation is used here. At optimal Ca(2+) concentration, the Mg(2+) has an inhibitory effect. The enzyme does not require Na+ or/and K+ for activation by Ca(2+). Other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate, but V for ATP is the highest. The Km for ATP is 8.85 - 10(-5) M. The optimal pH for Ca(2+) activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2. Well known inhibitors of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, mitochondria ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase in the erthrocyte do not inhibit the enzyme. In the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction containing cell and Golgi body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an ameloblast layer, stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum.\n",
      "Preparation and characterization of an enzymatically active immobilized derivative of myosin. Purified skeletal muscle myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) has been covalently bound to Sepharose 4B by the cyanogen bromide procedure. The resulting complex, Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 33% of the specific ATPase activity of the bound myosin is retained. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85% of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying pH, ionic strength, and cation concentration. The ATPase profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are found. The Sepharose-Myosin ATPase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent KM is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.\n",
      "Radioactive labeling and location of specific thiol groups in myosin from fast, slow and cardiac muscles. 1. Based on incorporation of radioactively labeled N-ethylmaleimide, the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) from fast, slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into 3 types. All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2 thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule. Both thiol-1 and thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase, are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types. 2. The variation in the incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized. In all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature. 3. Using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin. This qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar ATPase activities.\n",
      "Yeast glutathione reductase. Studies of the kinetics and stability of the enzyme as a function of pH and salt concentration. 1. The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH in the range pH 4.5--8.0. Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration. The stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate concentration. The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme.\n",
      "Characteristics of the dephosphorylated form of phosphorylase purified from rat liver and measurement of its activity in crude liver preparations. The phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan : orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1) (phosphorylase a) is active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b), in contrast to the muscle enzyme, has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of AMP. We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts. Interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with little change in total activity. A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes.\n",
      "Multiple forms of casein kinase from rabbit erythrocytes. Two rabbit erythrocyte casein kinases, GTP:casein kinase I and GTP:casein kinase II, have been purified 29 000- and 47 000-fold, respectively. Studies employing sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase I has a molecular weight of about 9.5 - 10(5) (25 S) and kinase II about 1.4 - 10(6) (32 S). These enzymes can utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor. Among various protein substrates examined, these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein greater than 50% dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to 50% dephosphorylated casein greater than phosvitin. Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors. Kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by NaCl. Both phosphotransferases require Mg(2+) for activity and are optimally active at pH 9.0. The enzymes have apparent Km values of 2.5 - 10(-5) M for GTP, 2 - 10(-5) M for ATP, and 0.4--0.6 mg/ml for casein. The incorporation of the terminal phosphate of GTP into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to varying degrees by ATP, ITP, ADP, and GDP but not by UTP, CTP, GMP, adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. In addition, NaF and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid are also found to inhibit the activity of both kinases. The effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is interesting and suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the casein kinases in the red blood cells.\n",
      "Kinetic studies and effects of anions on creatine phosphokinase from skeletal muscle of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). A purification procedure for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) from muscle of the monke35--170 muequiv H+/mg protein per min at 30 degrees C and a yield of approx. 0.5 g/kg muscle. Assuming equilibrium kinetics, synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions. Kinetic constants for the binding of each substrate to the free enzyme and the enzyme-second substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for the enzyme from other species. Inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products. SO4(2-) inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group. Inhibition by NO3-, NO2-, SCN- and Cl- is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar transition-state complex. These anions stabilize the dead-end complex, enzyme-creatine-MgADP, which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group. The effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis. The dead-end complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group against inhibition by iodoacetamide. Addition of NO3- or Cl- to the dead-end complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection. The essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is essentially independent of pH over the normal stability range of the enzyme. Contrary to our previous report this pH independence is not altered by the presence of dead-end complex, creatine plus MgADP, in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture. It is  inferred that the 'essential' thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same properties as that of the rabbit enzyme. In consequence, the inferences made about the role of this group based on our previous work on the monkey enzyme are no longer valid. The present findings are compatible with the essential thiol group playing a conformational role in the catalytic process.\n",
      "Studies on rat renal cortical cell kallikrein. I. Separation and measurement. A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel filtered on Sephadex G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate buffer. Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors, bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields were about 70% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates. Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged from 83-108% (mean 96%). Using this technique, it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from 0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe) esterase units per 10(8) cells. However, cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 37 degrees C for 3-8 h contained no measurable kallikrein activity, whereas the surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone.\n",
      "Studies on electron transfer between mercury electrode and hemoprotein. The electrochemical behaviour of ferricytochrome c, metmyoglobin and methemoglobin was studied using d.c., a.c. and differential pulse polarography, and controlled potential electrolysis. 1. The three hemoproteins yield d.c. polarographic steps, and peaks in differential pulse polarograms, the height of which is proportional to concentration. The charge transfer is influenced by strong adsorption. 2. The concentration dependence of the a.c. polarograms indicates structural changes in the adsorbed molecules. 3. The reduction products of controlled potential electrolysis of metmyoglobin and methemoglobin have absorption spectra identical with the native control samples. The affinity for oxygen and the cooperativity in hemoglobin are not affected by the reaction at the electrode. 4. The charge transfer proceeds via adsorbed, already reduced, molecules to freely diffusible proteins.\n",
      "The binding of organic phosphates to human methaemoglobin A. Perturbation of the polymerization of proteins by effectors. Theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium. The problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding sites and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states. It is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent. Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which binding sites are not conserved (and binding affinities are altered) on polymer formation. The latter type of system is exemplified by studies on methaemoglobin A in 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.4. In the absence of added organic phosphate effectors, a dimer-tetramer equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of 4.15 +/- 0.06 X 10(3) 1/mol, determined from sedimentation equilibrium results. Correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric (alpha beta) and tetrameric (alpha beta)2 species with intrinsic binding constants 1.03-10(3)-1.20-10(3) and 1.1-10(4)-2.1-10(4) 1/mol, respectively. It is also shown that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate perturbs the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in a similar way to ATP.\n",
      "N-terminal spin label studies of hemoglobin, Ligand and pH dependence. Human hemoglobin was spin labeled with 4-isothiocanato-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperdinooxyl, which is known to bind specifically to the N-terminal alpha-amino groups of proteins and slightly to the reactive sulfhydryl groups. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis indicated a partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites. Using specific blocking reagents prior to spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal valines (mobile). The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and pH, while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all pH ranges studied, while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic pH range, but become more restricted in the acidic pH range.\n",
      "The behavior of holo- and apo-forms of bovine superoxide dismutase at low pH. 1. Holo-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes has been shown to undergo a reversible structural modification in the pH 3-5 range. 2. The spectral alterations observed on changing from neutrality to pH 2 were: a slight attenuation of the 680 nm absorbance; the loss of the 450 nm shoulder, apparent in the optical spectrum of the native protein; and a new band appeared at 330 nm. The circular dichroism at 600 nm was essentially lost while a weak negative band appeared at approx. 380 nm and a positive band at 310 nm. 3. The EPR spectrum was also modified on changing from the native to the low pH form: A parallel increased from approximately 130 to approximately 150 G, g parallel remained unchanged at approximately 2.27, and gm decreased from approximately 2.09 to approximately 2.08. The apparent linewidth remained essentially constant. 4. High resolution (220 MHz) PMR spectra of holo- and apoproteins revealed that the metals influence the three-dimensional structure of the protein. 5. PMR studies indicated that at pH 3 the apoprotein existed almost entirely in a random coil form and that it assumed a compact well-ordered structure on returning to neutral pH. The holoprotein maintained a compact, apparently dimeric, structure even at pH 3.\n",
      "Mechanical precipitation of hemoglobin köln. Hb Köln (beta 98 Val leads to Met) was found to precipitate rapidly during mechanical shaking. The rate of precipitation of Hb Köln is 5-6 times faster than that of Hb S. The kinetics of precipitation of the patient's hemolysate, which is a mixture of Hb Köln and Hb A, showed a biphasic curve indicating that Hb Köln precipitates independently from Hb A. The instability of Hb Köln may be attributed to the conformational change in the vicinity of heme. The mechanical shaking may be used as a new method for detection and quantitation of hemoglobin Köln and other unstable hemoglobins.\n",
      "Physical properties and subunits of Haemopis grandis erythrocruorin. The erythrocruorin of the leech Haemopis grandis possessed an S20,w of 57 S at neutral pH, its isoelectric point at pH 6.0 and exhibited a slightly sigmoid oxygenation curve with n approximately 2.1 and P50 = 11.2 mm at pH 7.4. A minimum molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight %, respectively. The subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH. Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively. When the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, three subunits  were observed, possessing molecular weights of about 13000 (I), 16500 (II) and 28000 (III). Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit II was provided by subunit 1 and subunit III was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3. Haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains. It is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group. The shape of the Haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins.\n",
      "Myosin from arterial smooth muscle: isolation following actin depolymerization. The contractile proteins from arterial smooth muscle are highly soluble, and can be extracted at I = 0.05. However, they can be precipitated by a prolonged dialysis at pH 6 to give an actomyosin with a high, although variable, actin:myosin ratio. The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition by preparative ultracentrifugation. Comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the behaviors of these two systems. It was found that much smooth muscle actomyosin is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions, and that it sediments at a slower rate than F-actin. The solubility of the supernatant protein (a myosin-enriched actomyosin) in 0.2 M K Cl (pH 7) depended on the pH during centrifugation. A lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin concentration in the supernatant, suggesting a dependence on actin repolymerization. Pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant by polyethylene glycol-6000, but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic strength. The solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from striated muscles. A relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested.\n",
      "Hybrids of chemical derivatives of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase. The activities of hybrid dimers of alkaline phosphatase containing two chemically modified subunits have been investigated. One hybrid species was prepared by dissociation and reconstitution of a mixture of two variants produced by chemical modification of the native enzyme with succinic anhydride and tetranitromethane, respectively. The succinyl-nitrotyrosyl hybrid was separated from the other members of the hybrid set by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and then converted to a succinyl-aminotyrosyl hybrid by reduction of the modified tyrosine residues with sodium dithionite. A comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with the activities of the succinyl, nitrotyrosyl and aminotyrosyl derivatives has shown that either the subunits of alkaline phosphatase function independently or if the subunits turnover alternately in a reciprocating mechanism, then the intrinsic activity of each subunit must be strongly dependent on its partner subunit.\n",
      "Some physicochemical properties of hemoglobin-manitoba (alpha2 102Ser replaced by Arg (G9) beta2). Hb-Manitoba was discovered in 1970 [1] in a Canadian family of British origin. Recently we observed the same variant in a second family, and found that the oxy-derivative of Hb-Manitoba is slightly unstable at 65 degrees C, dissociates less readily at alkaline pH than does Hb-A, and forms asymmetric hybrids with other hemoglobins which are readily detectable by electrophoresis.\n",
      "The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin Tak, a variant with an elongated beta chain. The oxygen affinity was investigated of purified Hb Tak, a human haemoglobin variant with elongated beta-chains. A very low P50 value was found which was not influenced by the addition of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate. The n value was 1, indicating non-cooperativity. The oxygen equilibrium curve of the whole blood haemolysate containing Hbs A and Tak was close to that of Hb A at the top of the curve, while the bottom of the curve greatly deviated from the latter, indicative of small if any interaction between Hb A and Tak during oxygenation.\n",
      "Effects of membrane ribonuclease and 3'-nucleotidase on the digestion of polyuridylic acid by rat liver plasma membrane. 1. Fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease activity which at pH 7.8 in the presence of 10 mM EDTA can digest polyuridylic acid (poly(U)) and polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) but not polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) and polyguanylic acid (poly(G)). Under these conditions, the membrane preparation does not degrade native or denatured DNA. 2. The products of the reaction with poly(U) (10 mM EDTA present) can be separated on DEAE-Sephadex into oligonucleotides of increasing chain length. Most of the products are di- to hexa-nucleotides which contain terminal 3'-phosphate groups. 3. When EDTA is not present (pH 7.8 or 8.8) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly(A) and poly(U). With poly(A) the product is all nucleoside while with poly(U) as substrate most of the product is nucleoside, but also some oligonucleotides are produced. 4. The ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from high concentrations of poly(U) (mg/ml). 5. Uridine trinucleotide with and without a terminal 3'-phosphate group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane. The trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the trinucleotide itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products, including nucleoside.\n",
      "Alterations in phospholipid-dependent (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity due to lipid fluidity. Effects of cholesterol and Mg2+. The (Na+ +K+)-activated, Mg2+-dependent ATPase from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated, soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids, using deoxycholate. This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM. Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively. The ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol. The cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below. Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km values for ATP. Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in this context.\n",
      "Conformational and molecular responses to pH variation of the purified membrane adenosine triphosphatase of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. A preparation of ATPase from the membranes of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, solubilized and more than 95% pure, showed two main bands in analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They did not correspond to isoenzymes because one band could be converted into the other by exposure to a mildly alkaline pH value. The conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight, circular dichroism and catalytic properties. Denaturation by pH at 25 degrees C was followed by means of circular dichroism, ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A large conformational transition took place in the acid range with midpoints at about pH = 3.6 (I = 10(-4) M), 4.3 (I = 0.03 M) and 5.3 (I = 0.1 M). The transition was irreversible. Strong aggregation of the protein occurred in this range of pH. The final product was largely random coil, but even at pH 1.5 dissociation into individual subunits was not complete. However, partial dissociation took place at pH 5 (I = 0.028 M). At this pH value the enzyme was inactive, but 20-30% of the activity could be recovered when the pH was returned to 7.5. In the alkaline region the midpoint of the transition occurred near pH = 11 (I = 0.028 M). The pK of most of the tyrosine residues of the protein was about 10.9. The unfolding was irreversible and the protein was soon converted into peptide species with molecular weights lower than those determined for the subunits by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. Conventional proteolysis did not account for the transformation.\n",
      "Membrane-bound enzymes. III. Protease activity in leucocytes in relation to erythrocyte membranes. Protease activity was detected in membranes of human bovine erythrocytes prepared by the conventional procedures which include washing and removal of the  \"buffy layer\". The enzyme was extracted by 0.75 M KCNS or (NH4)2SO4 and was activated by 0.4 to 0.5 M of the same salts. Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. An alkaline protease (pH 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.\n",
      "Polymer concentration dependence of the helix to random coil transition of a charged polypeptide in aqueous salt solution. The helix to coil transition of poly(L-glutamic acid) was investigated in 0.05 and 0.005 M aqueous potassium chloride solutions by use of potentiometric titration and circular dichroism measurement. Polymer concentration dependence of the transition was observed in the range from 0.006 to 0.04 monomol/e in 0.005 M KG1 solution. The polymer concentration dependence can be interpreted by current theories of the transition of charged polypeptides and of titration curves of linear weak polyelectrolytes taking the effect of polymer concentration into consideration.\n",
      "[Structure formation in interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid boundaries]. In connection with the modelling of biomembranes regularities of the formation and development of interphase adsorption layers of lysozyme at liquid borders under different conditions and depending on the nature of carbohydrate phase were investigated by the determination of mechanical characteristics of such layers. The investigations carried out showed that the most solid layers appeared under the conditions which assured the formation of the maximum number of intermolecular bonds (which in a common case is performed with maximum disorderlinesss of the macromolecules which get at the interphase).\n",
      "[Relation between fluorescence and circular dichroism of the complex of the fluorescence probe 4-dimethylaminochalcone with serum albumin]. The fluorescence probe(4-dimethylaminochalcone; DMH) was noncovalently linked to human serum albumin (HSA). The variation of pH was due to serum albumin structural changes, which was determined in terms of DMH and HSA fluorescence and CD spectra. Considerable changes of fluorescence and CD spectra were observed at pH 8 and 10, where there is ionization of two more recently titrated tyrosin residues. It is assumed that these two tyrosine residues are in binding region and quench the fluorescence of DMH between pH 4 to 8. Quenching disappears if these residues are ionized (pH greater than 8) or if the protein undergoes the N -F transition (pH less than 4).\n",
      "[Luminescence study of the effect of temperature on the conformational state of fibrinogen]. Results are presented of measuring fibrinogen fluorescence parameters in temperature range of 20-80 degrees C at different pH of the solution. It was found that the temperature increase from 20 to 40 degrees C for solutions with pH of 4,5-9,3 were not accompanied by the conformational changes of fibrinogen macromolecules. In the temperature range of 40-50 degrees C for neutral solutions conformational reconstruction of fibrinogen of undenatured character took place. Temperature increase above 50-55 degrees C brings about significant structural changes of fibrinogen molecule which are of denaturation nature.\n",
      "[Combined effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on the functional state of the respiratory center]. Experiments were conducted on cats under nembutal anesthesia; a study was made of pulse activity of bulbar respiratory neurons, electrical activity of the diaphragm and of the intercostal muscles; pO2, pCO2, pH, arterial blood oxygen saturation were determined in combined action of hypoxia and hypercapnia. When hypoxic gaseous mixture was given for respiration the developing hypocapnia disturbed the discharge rhythmic activity of the respiratory neurons, the respiration acquiring a pathological character of the Cheyne--Stokes type. After addition to the hypoxic gaseous mixture of 2% CO2 the gaseous composition of the arterial blood approached the initial values; this addition prevented the development of hypercapnia and disturbances of rhythmic discharge activity of the respiratory neurons. Addition of 5% CO2 to the hypoxic gaseous mixture produced a negative effect: at first it intensified and then depressed the pulse activity of the respiratory neurons, caused metabolic and respiratory acidosis, and promoted asphyxia.\n",
      "[Level of nicotinamide coenzymes in the liver and myocardium of rats poisoned with dichlorethane]. Experiments were conducted on male rats. A study was made of the content of nicotinamide coenzymes in the liver and myocardium 24 hours after the administration of 0.5 ml of dichloroethane into the stomach. In parallel with disturbance of the morphological structure of the liver and of the myocardium, increase in the activity of alanine and aspargic aminotranspherases in the blood serum, dichloroethane reduced the content of nicotinamide coenzymes and deranged the ratio of their oxidized and reduced forms in these organs.\n",
      "[Effect of carbidine on conditioned defense reflexes]. Chronic experiments were conducted on rats and rabbits; a study was made of the effect of carbidine on the conditioned defence reflexes in stimulation of the mesencephalic part of the reticular formation. Carbidine prevented the depression of the conditioned defence reflexes caused by stimulation of the mesencephalic portion of the reticular formation. This pointed to its depressive influence on the mentioned structures, and was confirmed by experiments on rabbits in recording changes in biocurrents under conditions of stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation.\n",
      "[Level of nicotinamide coenzymes in the myocardium of rats during the effects of methylxanthines (theophylline, theobromine, caffeine) and catecholamines]. It was shown in acute experiments on rats that one hour after an intraperitoneal injection of theophylline (50 mg/kg) there was a decrease in the NAD + NADP content by 19.4%, a tendency to a fall of NAD.H2 + NADP.H2 was expressed, and the total nicotinamide coferment level was reduced. A tendency to decrease NAD + NADP and the total pyridine nucleotide level was seen after caffeine administration. The action of catecholamines and methylxanthines was compared. Theobromine produced no significant effect on the indices under study. It was shown that isadrine decreased the NAD + NADP level; adrenaline (25 mkg/kg) increased the content of both the oxidized (by 24%) and of the reduced (by 48%) forms of pyridine nucleotides. An increase of adrenaline dose to 1000 mkg/kg was accompanied by reduction of the oxidized forms (by 22.2%) and of the total nicotinamide coferment level (by 18%).\n",
      "Potable water quality in rural Georgetown County. Drinking water supplies of 161 rural communities, in Georgetown County, South Carolina, were randomly selected for sample collection. The analysis showed that most of the waters were slightly acidic. Low, but acceptable concentrations of chloride, copper, fluoride, sodium, cadmium, nitrate and phosphate were found. A few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic, mercury, zinc and lead. Although only 2% of the samples exceeded the mandatory limit of 0.05 ppm for arsenic, 72% exceeded the recommended level of 0.01 ppm. The mandatory limit for manganese was exceeded in 37% of the waters while 88% exceeded the limit for iron. The high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in 45% of the samples. The well depth and the consumer income had some bearing on water quality. Statistical evidence suggested that septic tank seepage was partially responsible for nitrate, phosphate, iron and arsenic contamination of shallow water supplies. Lead concentrations appear to vary according to the plumbing used and the pH of the waters.\n",
      "The importance of an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus in preventing postoperative duodenogastric reflux and gastritis. This study has investigated the relationship between duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and certain symptoms 6-12 months after three operations for uncomplicated duodenal ulcer. The operations studied were proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV, 20 cases), truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV+P, 22 cases) and truncal vagotomy and antrectomy (TV+A, 21 cases). Duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation. Incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy. Symptoms were assessed by symptomatic score and Visick grading. There was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy (P less than 0-01). There was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation. The amount of reflux did not differ before operation. There was significantly less reflux following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than 0-025) or TV+A (P less than 0-001). The results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and intact antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and symptoms.\n",
      "Haemoglobin Rahere (beta Lys-Thr): A new high affinity haemoglobin associated with decreased 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding and relative polycythaemia. A new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity, beta82 (EF6) lysine leads to threonine (Hb Rahere), was found during the investigation of a patient who was found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count. The substitution affects one of the 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding sites, resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen, but both the haem-haem interaction and the alkaline Bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate. This variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at alkaline pH but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity; it could be separated from haemoglobin A, however, by electrophoresis in agar at acid pH. The raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume (a relative polycythaemia) and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count. This case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is not evident.\n",
      "Endoscopic papillotomy and removal of gall stones. Endoscopic papillotomy was attempted in 59 patients with extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary duct system and was actually performed in 50 patients. A special high-frequency diathermy knife was introduced via a duodenoscope into the terminal common bile duct and the roof of the papilla was incised. In 33 out of 39 patients with choledocholithiasis the stones passed into the duodenum spontaneously or were removed endoscopically. Papillary stenosis without ductal stones was successfully treated with this method in eight out of 11 patients. One perforation of the duodenocholedochal junction occurred and was repaired surgically. Endoscopic papillotomy and stone extraction is a relatively safe and effective method of treating extrahepatic jaundice.\n",
      "Inhibitory postsynaptic actions of taurine, GABA and other amino acids on motoneurons of the isolated frog spinal cord. The actions of glycine, GABA, alpha-alanine, beta-alanine and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons of the isolated spinal cord of the frog. All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids. When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine. Topically applied strychnine and picrotoxin induced different changes of post-synaptic potentials, indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be influenced by these two convulsants. Interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. But differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. With regard to these results the importance of taurine and GABA as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed.\n",
      "The involvement of lysophosphoglycerides in neurotransmitter release; the composition and turnover of phospholipids of synaptic vesicles of guinea-pig cerebral cortex and Torpedo electric organ and the effect of stimulation. (1) Crude synaptosomal fractions (P2) derived from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were incubated in the presence of 50 mM KCl in a Krebs-glucose medium. Torpedo marmorata electric organs were stimulated electrically in vivo at 5 pulses/sec for 30 min by electrodes placed on the electric lobe. Synaptic vesicles were isolated from each source and the phospholipid compositions analysed and compared with vesicles  from unstimulated controls. (2) Lysophosphatidylcholine was the only lysophosphoglyceride demonstrable in the synaptic vesicles from either source and its low levels did not increase as a result of chemical or electircal stimulation. In each case there was a close similarity of the phospholipid distributions in the vesicles taken from control and stimulated samples. (3) Control experiments indicated extensive decreases in the acetylcholine content of the vesicles from the stimulated electric organ and smaller decreases in the acetylcholine content of the synaptic vesicles from stimulated crude synaptosomal fractions. These fractions were found to respire linearly in the presence of 10 mM glucose and the vesicle fractions were shown to have low levels of contaiminating membranes as judged by marker enzyme analyses. (4) Crude synaptosomal fractions from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were incubated in a Krebs-glucose medium with labelled fatty acids and [3H]glucose in the presence or absence of 50 mM KCl. Subsynaptosomal fractionation was carried out and specific radioactivities of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were determined in fractions D (synaptic vesicles), E (microsomes) and H (disrupted synaptosomes). The release of neurotransmitter did not significantly enhance the labelling of phospholipids in any of the fractions studied as compared with phospholipids from unstimulated fractions. This was found after two incubation times and using [14C]oleate, [14C]arachidonate, [3H]palmitate and [3H]glucose.\n",

The effects of acid-base changes on cardiac output during diethyl ether anaesthesia were studied in 25 mongrel dogs prepared by surgically implanting a plastic encased non-ferrous core electromagnetic probe on the ascending aorta. The findings are: (1) Metabolic acidaemia produced only slight decrease in cardiac output but a more marked fall became evident with decreasing pH(2) Respiratory acidaemia led to a slight rise in cardiac output. (3) Respiratory alkalaemia decreased cardiac output. (4) Metabolic alkalaemia also produced a decline in cardiac output.\n",
      "The prevention of autolysis of stored cornea using steroid as a lysosome membrane stabilizer. Many eyes donated for use in corneal grafting are rejected because of signs of autolysis in the donor material. The purpose of this experimental study was to determine whether hydrocortisone acting as a lysosome membrane stabilizer could prevent or retard autolysis of the corneas under storage, and if so, what was the most efficacious concentration. Different groups of rabbit corneas were placed in saline as controls or in varying concentrations of hydrocortisone (10(-10) M to 10(-4) M at pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Acid phosphatase released after six hours was measured biochemically. This enzyme was used as a marker enzyme reflecting lysosomal labilization. Results showed a significant stabilization of the lysosomal membrane at 4 degrees C as compared to 37 degrees C. A trend towards stabilization of the lysosomal membrane was seen when 10(-8) M concentration of hydrocortisone at 37 degrees C was used, there being no demonstrable stabilization at 4 degrees C.\n",
      "Respiratory effects of H+ and dinitrophenol injections into the brain stem subarachnoid space of fetal lambs. Mock cerebrospinal fluid (pH 5.37-8.38) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) (0.15-1.5 mg) was injected into the subarachnoid space of the ventral brain stem of exteriorized fetal sheep. Changes in pH on the ventral surface of the medulla did not stimulate respiratory efforts or induce significant cardiovascular changes. The respiratory response to DNP injections ranged from no response to prolonged rhythmic ventilation that was independent of the peripheral chemoreceptors or the control arterial pH and blood gas tensions. This inconsistency suggests an effector site somewhat removed from the immediate surface of the medulla. The heart rate and blood pressure were not affected. It is concluded that increased H+ concentration in the extracellular fluid of the fetal ventral medulla does not initiate respiration, and any respiratory response to metabolic inhibitors applied to this area therefore is not attributable to a secondary change in surface pH.\n",
      "Soil fungistasis: elevation of the exogenous carbon and nitrogen requirements for spore germination by fungistatic volatiles in soils. Axenic, washed conidia of Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, Aspergillus flavus, and Verticillium albo-atrum were placed on washed Difco purified agar discs along with an inorganic salt solution containing various levels of carbon and nitrogen substrates. These discs were exposed to volatiles from six soils (pH 5.1-8.6). Fusarium solani macroconidial germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.5, but high levels of glucose and NH4Cl reversed this inhibition, raising germination to that of no-soil, no-carbon or nitrogen controls. Conidial germination of A. flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles from high pH (7.0, 7.8, and 8.6) soils, and increased levels of glucose plus an amino acid mixture nullified this inhibition. Volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, and 7.5 stimulated A. flavus conidial germination. Assays after the removal of CO2 from the air above soil of pH 5.1 demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory to A. flavus were produced by this soil. Assays indicated that a KOH-soluble compound was a fungistatic soil volatile to F. solani macroconidial germination. The nullification by carbon and nitrogen substrates of F. solani and A. flavus inhibition caused by soil volatiles parallels that for soil fungistasis. Conidial germination of V. albo-atrum was markedly stimulated by volatiles in all soils tested, and was not affected by removal of CO2. Inhibitory soil volatiles may increase the nutritional requirements for spore germination of certain fungi.\n",
      "Nitrofurazone-reducing enzymes in E. coli and their role in drug activation in vivo. Earlier work showed that Escherichia coli contains at least two enzymes which reduce nitrofurazone and other nitrofuran derivatives. One of these enzymes is lacking in some nitrofurazone-resistant mutant strains. We now report that there are three separable nitrofuran reductases in this organism: reductase I (mol. wt. approximately 50 000, insensitive to O2), reductase IIa (mol. wt. approximately 120 000, inhibited by oxygen), reductase IIb (mol. wt. approximately 700 000, inhibited by O2). Unstable metabolites formed during the reduction of nitrofurazone by preparations containing reductases IIa and IIb produce breaks in DNA in vitro. In vivo experiments with nitrofurazone-resistant strains, which lack reductase II but contain reductases IIa and IIb, demonstrated that lethality, mutation, and DNA breakage are all greatly increased when cultures are incubated under anaerobic conditions, i.e., conditions such that reductase II is active. These results provide further evidence for the importance of reductive activation of nitrofurazone.\n",
      "Enzymatic hydrolysis of agar: purification and characterization of neoagarobiose hydrolase and p-nitrophenyl alpha-galactoside hydrolase. The mixture of polysaccharides in the gelling component of agar (agarose) is hydrolyzed to D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose by a series of hydrolytic enzymes obtained from Pseudomonas atlantica. The final degradative step in the pathway of agarose decomposition is the hydrolysis of the alpha-linkage in the dissaccharide neoagarobiose yielding D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose. Pseudomonas atlantica when grown on agar produces two specific enzymes, p-nitrophenyl alpha-galactose hydrolase and neoagarobiose hydrolase. The purification and partial characterization of both enzymes are presented.\n",
      "Temperature and pH optima for 21 species of thermophilic and thermotolerant fungi. A glucose-containing mineral medium supplemented with 0.01% yeast extract is described upon which all the species of thermophilic and thermotolerant fungi tested will grow. Thirteen of the 21 species do not require the yeast extract supplement for growth. Using this solid, supplemented mineral medium, the pH and temperature optima for growth of all strains were measured. No correlation was found between temperature optimum and pH optimum among members of the group tested.\n",
      "Physiological differences among isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi. Significant differences in amylase, beta-glucosidase, and phosphatase activities were observed among four Phytophthora cinnamomi isolates grown in nutrient-amended sterilized soil for 20 days. Amylase pH optima for the four isolates were within a relatively narrow range; at pH 5.5 each isolate was within 90% of its peak activity. Isolates SB-216-1, 1-281, and C-39 each exhibited maximal beta-glucosidase activity at pH 5.0 and maximal phosphatase activity at pH 5.0-5.5. Maximal activity for these two enzymes of isolate A-7725 occurred at pH 3.5. In timed experiments, isolates 1-281 and A-7725 exhibited greater amylase activities than did the other two isolates. For beta-glucosidase, greatest activity was observed for SB-216-1; ACTivity of 1-281 was intermediate and least activity was observed for isolates A-7725 and C-39. Isolates SB-216-1 and 1-281 exhibited greatest phosphatase activities; isolate C-39 was intermediate in activity, and A-7725 was least active. Results indicate that significant differences exist among the isolates tested and that these differences can be quantitatively measured by the methods described.\n",
      "Regulation and properties of an invertase from Clostridium pasteurianum. An intracellular invertase was induced in cultures of Clostridium pasteurianum utilizing sucrose as its carbon source for growth. This enzyme synthesis could be repressed by the addition of fructose of a sucrose-growing culture. In contrast, invertase activity was not affected by the addition of glucose to sucrose-growing cells and this enzyme could be induced in a glucose-metabolizing culture by the addition of sucrose. This enzyme was purified 10.5-fold over the induced lese, EC 3.2.1.26) by substrate-specificity studies. Invertase had a pH optimum of 6.5 and an apparent Km of 79.5 mM for sucrose, and required high concentration of potassium phosphate for maximum activity. Invertase was completely inactivated by a 2-min heat treatment at 60 degrees C. This enzyme was strongly inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pCMB) and weakly inhibited by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), while cysteine could substantially reverse pCMB) inhibition, suggesting that sulfhydryl group(s) were necessary for invertase activity.\n",
      "Characterization studies on the membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) of Azotobacter vinelandii. The adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.3) activity in Azotobacter vinelandii concentrates in the membranous R3 fraction that is directly associated with Azotobacter electron transport function. Sonically disrupted Azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3 membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2 h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction. Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was stimulatory. Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level. Sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect. The reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied (0-60 min). The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3 electron transport fraction. The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25% loss of activity as compared with a 14% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60%) did occur by overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore ATPase activity. This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not responsible for ATPase inactivation. The addition of azide, ouabain, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or oligomycin to the assay system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the ATPase activity. The property of trypsin activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation.\n",
      "Effects of zinc-smelter emissions on forest soil microflora. Within 2 km of a zinc (Zn) smelter in Palmerton, Pennsylvania, near the Lehigh Water Gap, up to 13.5% Zn by weight has been measured in the O2 horizon of the soil, and up to 8% Zn in the A1 horizon. The total numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi (measured by dilution plate counts) were greatly reduced in the most severely Zn-contaminated soils compared with control soils. The reduction of microbial populations may be a partial cause of the decreased rate of litter decomposition at Lehigh Gap. Growth of most bacteria from control sites was reduced by 100 to 200 muM Zn, most actinomycetes by 100 muM Zn, and most fungi by 100 to 1000 muM Zn in thin-Pablum extract agar (TPab). All the tested actinomycetes and non-spore-forming bacteria isolated from Zn-contaminated Lehigh Gap soils were Zn-tolerant, growing normally in media containing 600-2000 muM Zn. Most fungi, regardless of source, were capable of at least 50% of normal growth at 700 muM Zn. Zinc-tolerant bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi were readily isolated from low-Zn soils, suggesting that selection for Zn tolerance may proceed rapidly. Acidophilic Mortierella species have been selectively eliminated near the smelter, apparently because of elevated soil pH. Peryronellaea glomerata (Corda) Goidanich and Coniothyrium spp. were found only in the high-Zn soils.\n",
      "alpha-Naphthoflavone activation of 6-hydroxymethylbenzo(alpha)pyrene synthetase. alpha-Naphthoflavone activates the aryl hydroxymethyl synthetase of both the microsomal membrane-bound and soluble enzymes of rat liver and rat lung. The enzyme catalyzes the hydroxymethylation of benzo(alpha)pyrene to the 6-hydroxymethyl derivative.\n",
      "The effects of the continuous administration of N,N-dimethyl-4-phenylazoaniline (DAB) on the activities and the inducibilities of some drug-metabolizing enzymes in rat liver. (1) The effect of feeding a relatively low-protein diet containing 0.06% DAB for 29 weeks on the activity of DAB-azoreductase, nitroreductase (p-nitrobenzoic acid), N-oxidase (N,N-dimethylaniline), N-demethylase (DAB), cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A were studied. Rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes, reaching minimal values at between 4 and 8 weeks. Activities then increased in all cases to control or nearly control levels. This rate of increase was least for cytochrome P-450. At 4 weeks azoreductase activity with the chemotherapeutic agent CB10-252 (I) as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats. Early increases occurred in the activities of beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A and the activity of the latter never dropped below the control level. (2) An investigation was made of the differential effects of dye feeding on some of the enzyme activities in the two major liver lobes and differences were found. (3) The effect of phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment on the DAB-fed rats was studied at 4-week intervals. The activities of DAB-azoreductase and of nitroreductase increased throughout the whole period, while the activities of the lysosomal enzymes were decreased. (4) After feeding DAB for 4 weeks the effect of PB and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) on the activities of DAB-azoreductase, CB10-252-azoreductase and components of the azoreductases-cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, the CO-CB10-252-azoreductase was not induced by PB or MC, and CO did not inhibit its reduction. Its reduction depended only slightly on NADH. CO caused a greater relative decrease in the activity of DAB-azoreductase in dye-fed animals and also in animals following PB and MC pretreatment, implying a greater role of  cytochrome P-450 in dye-fed animals.\n",
      "Some characteristics of two azoreductase systems in rat liver. Relevance to the activity of 2-[4'-di(2\"-bromopropyl)-aminophenylazo]benzoic acid (CB10-252), a compound possessing latent cytotoxic activity. The system involved in the reduction of 2-[4'-di(2''-bromopropyl) aminophenylazolbenzoic acid (CB10-252), an agent designed for treating primary liver cell cancer, has been demonstrated to be localised mainly in the 108 000 X g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate. It is also present in other organs particularly in the spleen. DAB-azoreductase as shown previously is present almost entirely in the microsomal fraction and is found in high concentration only in liver. The pH maximum for CB10-252-azoreductase implying the importance of the 2'-carboxyl group in determining substrate specificity. The use of enzyme inhibitors and other additives showed that CB10-252 WAS NOT AXANTHINE OXIDASE OR DIHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE. Its activity was not affected by carbon monoxide, phenobarbitone (PB), or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) pretreatment. Enhancement of the activity by ferrous ions and FAD indicated that at least part of the reduction system could involve a flavoprotein with FAD as the prosthetic group. The activity of CB10-252-azoreductase and methylred-azoreductase was reduced by menadione (vitamin K3), cyanide and propylgallate. A diaphorase preparation from pig heart reduced both CB10-252 and methylred with both NADPH- and NADH-generating systems.\n",
      "Mercury inhibition of avian fatty acid synthetase complex. (1) Subcutaneous or intra-abdominal injections of 8 mg of HgCl2/100 g body weight markedly depressed hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity of chicks at 1 h post-injection. The depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks continued to eat up until the time they were killed. Under these same conditions, the hepatic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) was not affected by HgCl2, while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation was stimulated. (2) When 2-mercaptoethanol was included in the incubation medium for a highly purified preparation of fatty acid synthetase, 500 muM HgCl2 was required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme. When 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted, 50 muM HgCl2 was inhibitory and 100 muM HgCl2 abolished enzyme activity. (3) 2 mM dithiothreitol completely protected the purified fatty acid synthetase preparation from inhibition by 100 muM HgCl2. When dithiothreitol was added after the addition of enzyme to the mercury-containing medium, protection of the enzyme was not complete. (4) Dialysis of cytosol fractions from chicks injected with HgCl2 against 500 vol. of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4 degrees stimulated the fatty acid synthetase activity of the fractions. Dialysis of cytosol fractions from noninjected chicks under the same conditions was without effect on fatty acid synthetase activity. (5) These data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of HgCl2 administered in vivo on hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity in chicks is mediated through the interaction of mercury with the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme.\n",
      "[Basic phospholipase of Naja nigricollis venom]. It is confirmed that N. nigricollis venom contains several phospholipases one of these is a basic phospholipase A. This enzyme is toxic for mice when injected intravenously. In vitro it reacts on egg yolk lecithin producing lysolecithin and prevents the phenomenon of blood clotting. An immunological identity has been established between this basic phospholipase and two acidic phospholipases present in the same venom.\n",
      "[Spontaneous mortality and vascular lesions in 3 rat strains with different blood pressure levels].

      "Effects of decreasing arterial blood pressure on cerebral blood flow in the baboon. Influence of the sympathetic nervous system. The influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean arterial blood pressure was studied in anesthetized baboons. Cerebral blood flow was measured by the 133Xe clearance method, and arterial blood pressure was decreased by controlled hemorrhage. In normal baboons, the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 65% of the base-line value; thereafter, cerebral blood flow decreased when arterial blood pressure was reduced. Superior cervical sympathectomy of 2-3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response. In contrast, both acute surgical sympathectomy (cervical trunk division) and alpha-receptor blockade (1.5 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine) enhanced the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that cerebral blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 35% of the base-line value. The results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of a fall in arterial blood pressure. Indeed, the implication is that the sympathicoadrenal discharge accompanying hemorrhagic hypotension is detrimental to, rather than responsible for,  cerebral autoregulation.\n",
      "Influence of hematocrit, blood gas tensions, and pH on pressure-flow relations in the isolated canine lung. An isolated perfused canine lung preparation in which determinants of vascular caliber could be individually controlled was developed. The relation of pulmonary arterial (Pa), venous (PV), and alveolar (PA) pressures was such that Pa greater than PA greater than PV throughout the whole lung. The addition of isoprenaline to the perfusate abolished vascular reactivity. Once stability was reached, vascular cross-sectional area remained acceptably constant for 2.25 hours as judged by normalized conductance. The influence of perfusate hematocrit, blood gas tensions, and pH on pressure-flow relations was then studied in 15 isolated canine lungs. The hematocrit-vascular conductance relation was derived at constant perfusion pressure. Conductance varied linearly with hematocrit over a range of 16.5 to 89.5%. Mean pulmonary arterial blood gas tensions were: PO2 = 121 mm Hg, PCO2 = 28 mm Hg, and pH = 7.46. Acute respiratory acidosis (PO2 = 30 mm Hg, PCO2 = 81 mm Hg, pH = 7.17) and lactic acidosis and hypoxemia (PO2 = 32 mm Hg, PCO2 = 21 mm Hg, pH = 6.96) did not significantly alter this relation. Transformation of the conductance-hematocrit data indicated that hematocrit was the most important determinant of relative apparent viscosity of the blood. Both acute respiratory and lactic acidosis failed to significantly increase relative viscosity within the range of hematocrit usually found in secondary polycythemia.\n",
      "Interaction of the chemoreflex and the pulmonary inflation reflex in the regulation of coronary circulation in conscious dogs. The interaction of chemoreflex and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to chemoreflex stimulation (intracarotid injection of nicotine) when ventilation was allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled. The responses were also compared with those elicited by both forced mechanical and spontaneous hyperinflation. When the heart rate was constant, intracarotidly administered nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic coronary flow from 48 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 8 ml/min and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from 1.62 +/- 0.08 to 0.78 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/ml min-1. After beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade, a similar coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was allowed to increase. However, when ventilation was controlled, intracarotidly administered nicotine increased coronary resistance after combined beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade. The reflex coronary dilation was not observed after carotid sinus nerve section or after alpha-receptor blockade. Thus, nicotine stimulation of the carotid chemoreflex results in a striking coronary dilation that has two components. The minor component involves a chemoreflex with its efferent pathway in tthe vagi. The major component of coronary dilation follows an increase in the depth of respiration, and its efferent component appears to involve withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic constrictor tone. An almost identical period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog.\n",
      "Effect of coronary blood flow on glycolytic flux and intracellular pH in isolated rat hearts. The rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization, tissue high-energy phosphates, and intracellular pH. A 60% reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a 30% reduction in oxygen consumption, an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization, lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate, and higher tissue levels of lactate and H+. Ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and peak systolic pressure. Further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis, a greater decrease in tissue levels of high-energy phosphates, and higher tissue levels of both lactate and H+. These changes in glycolytic flux, tissue metabolites, and ventricular performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow. The importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in oxygen-deficient hearts is emphasized. It is concluded that acceleration of ATP production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery. The central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of ATP production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis.\n",
      "Mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic rat hearts. The mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic myocardium were investigated in the isolated, perfused rat heart. Glycolysis was inhibited at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The major factors that accounted for the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and H+ in the ischemic tissue. Increased extracellular pH inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts. However, maintenance of both extracellular and intracellular pH caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis in ischemic hearts. Accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in both anoxic and ischemic hearts. At intracellular lactate concentrations between 15 and 20 mM, glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions. Addition of either 10, 20, or 40 mM lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic, anoxic, and ischemic hearts. The effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through changes in intracellular pH. It is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents a major factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts.\n",
      "Comparison of contractile performance of canine atrial and ventricular muscles. This study compared the contractile performance of a canine right atrial trabecula with that of a macroscopically indistinguishable trabecula isolated from the right ventricular apex. The heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies weighing 6-8 kg and placed in Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate solution. The bathing solution contained only 1.25 mmoles of Ca2+ and was bubbled with a 95% O2-5% CO2 gas mixture. Each atrial trabecula was specially selected from the right atrial appendage. Histologically, these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal orientation of the fibers. At Lmax (the length of the muscle at which developed tension was maximum) under identical conditions of temperature, rate of stimulation, ionic milieu, pH, and O2 and CO2 supply, right atrial trabeculae achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular trabeculae. In both muscle groups the maximum developed tension averaged about 2.5 g/mm2. Since Lo (expressed as a fraction of Lmax) was less in atrial muscle than it was in ventribular muscle, we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum length is reached. At any given initial muscle length, the maximum of tension rise for atrial trabeculae amounted to at least twice that for ventricular trabeculae. At any given load up to 1.5 g/mm2, the maximum velocity of shortening of an atrial trabecula was about three to four times that of a ventricular trabecula. These results collectively indicate that the contractile performance of the right atrial muscle is in many respects superior to that of the right ventricle, at least under the conditions of these experiments.\n",
      "Serum lactate dehydrogenase activity ratios with different substrates. 1. The lactate dehydrogenase activity of 89 sera from patients suffering myocardial infarction and of 55 sera from patients with hepatocellular damage was assayed under optimal conditions using pyruvate, alpha-oxobutyrate, hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate as substrates. Activity was also measured with lactate as substrate at different pH values. 2. The ratios of activities under these different assay conditions were calculated for both series of patients. Correct differentiations for single ratios ranged from virtually nil for hydroxypyruvate/alpha-oxobutyrate to is greater than 93 per cent for glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate/alpha-oxobutyrate. This was little improved by the use of multiple ratios involving up to seven separate assays. 3. The activity ratio of hydroxypyruvate to pyruvate which is consistently greater than unity was found to be inverted in a case of morphine poisoning.\n",
      "Fluorometric assay for N-acetylprocainamide. We describe a simple, rapid fluorometric assay for separate quantitative analysis of procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide in mixtures. The effective lenear range (fluorescence vs. concentration) in serum is 0.1 to 10.0 mg/liter, regardless of the ratio (by weight) of the two drugs from 1:10 to 10:1. Analytical recoveries by the extraction method used were 100.0 +/- 3.0% and 98.0 +/- 4.0%, respectively. For determination of either compound, the maximum coefficient of variation was 10%.\n",
      "Rapid kinetic measurement of lactate in plasma with a centrifugal analyzer. In this method, blood is collected in ammonium heparinized microhematocrit tubes and lactate is directly determined in the plasma, separated within 15 min from the erythrocytes. Lactate is assayed by mixing 10 mul of sample with NAD+ and lactate dehydrogenase in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrazine buffer. The rate of increase in absorbance of the NADH formed, measured at 340 nm, is proportional to lactate concentration. The assay is complete in 4 min and absorbance is linearly related to concentration from 0.625 to 15 mmol/liter. Analytical recoveries of lactate added to plasma averaged 104% (range, 91-116%). Results compared well for plasma samples analyzed by this method with the CentrifiChem and the Du Pont aca.\n",
      "Improved high-resolution high-voltage paper electrophoresis system for use in screening for aminoacidopathies. High-voltage paper electrophoresis of small samples of serum and urine at pH 6.0 resolves basic and acidic amino acids and separates them from the neutral amino acids. For separation and identification of the neutral amino acids, the appropriate area of the electrophoretogram is cut out, sewn onto a second sheet of paper, and rerun at pH 1.9. By this method, amino acids are rapidly resolved. It is suited for use with special procedures such as oxidation of biological fluid with performic acid and specific staining for confirmation of amino acid identification.\n",

A simple, highly sensitive and reproducible method for the assay of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2.3.2-) activity is introduced, using gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as a substrate and glycylglycine as an acceptor in 50 g/l of polyoxyethylene nonylphenol. Serum transpeptidase activity was assayed in 1080 healthy adults, the normal mean value being 14.8 mU/ml. The diagnostic evaluation of the enzyme in various hepatobiliary diseases is also discussed.\n",
      "Treatment of renal hypertension. There are different types of renal hypertension: hypertension due to parenchymal renal disease, renovascular hypertension, hypertension due to urological disease, hypertension of endstage renal disease. Treatment has to consider-above all-the possibility of specific, medical or surgical procedures that may cause the underlying condition. If the underlying disease is not amenable to specific therapy, symptomatic medical treatment to lower blood pressure is indicated: besides control of sodium-intake and body weight antihypertensive drugs are generally indicated. We use them, alone or in combination, in the following line of order: diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, dihydralazine, reserpine, clonidine, alpha-methyldopa, guanethidine.\n",
      "Anaerobic glycolysis in normal human erythrocytes incubated in vitro with sodium salicylate. 1. Some effects of sodium salicylate upon anaerobic glycolysis have been studied in normal human erythrocytes incubated for up to 6 h at 37 degrees C in autologous sera. 2. Both glucose consumption and lactate production were stimulated by concentrations of salicylate up to 60 mmol/l but at the highest concentration used (90 mmol/l) an initial stimulus was followed by inhibition of glycolysis. 3. Losses occurred of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine 5'-phosphate(AMP)at higher concentrations of salicylate and there was a concomitant increase of inorganic phosphate. 4. Other phosphate esters underwent concentration changes at higher concentrations of salicylate that reflected inadequate concentrations of ATP for glycolysis. 5. The rates of sodium efflux from, and potassium influx into, erythrocytes were unaffected by the presence of salicylate at concentrations sufficient to stimulate glycolysis.\n",
      "Arterial catecholamines in hypoxic exercise in man. 1. We measured the minute ventilation and arterial blood catecholamine concentrations in four normal men standing and at two levels of moderate treadmill exercise breathing 14% oxygen or air. 2. Minute ventilation was significantly higher during hypoxic exercise than during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min. 3. Arterial plasma noradrenaline during hypoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was significantly greater than at rest. 4. Arterial plasma noradrenaline during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was not elevated above the resting concentration. 5. The results are compatible with the suggestion that increased concentrations of arterial plasma noradrenaline contribute to the hypoxic potentiation of the respiratory response to moderate exercise.\n",
      "Effects of graded infusions of monomethylmethacrylate on coagulation, blood lipids, respiration and circulation. An experimental study in dogs. In 4 dogs injected intravenously (i.v.) with 125I labeled fibrinogen, 51Cr labeled platelets and 99mTc labeled albumin, and subjected to successively increasing amounts of i.v. infused monomethylmethacrylate, doses corresponding to the amounts released into the blood stream following implantation of acrylic cement during total hip replacements did not affect the clotting mechanism, did not cause trapping of platelets and fibrin in the lungs, did not generate fat emboli, and did not cause depression of the arterial oxygen tension or blood pressure. Monomethylmethacrylate in whole blood was associated with both blood cells and plasma.\n",
      "Influence of pH and hypoxia on the success of defibrillation. Clinical impressions about the problem of defibrillation during states of acid-base imbalance and hypoxia have been influenced by studies involving the effect of these derangements on the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Based on body weight, energy requirements for defibrillation in normal dogs were compared to requirements in dogs subjected to commonly encountered acid-base disturbances and severe hypoxemia. No significant differences were found. Seventy-five percent of all animals in the study were electrically converted with low-to-moderate levels of energy. The incidence of spontaneous resumption of circulation following defibrillation was lowest in animals subjected to metabolic acidosis and hypoxia. The results suggest that pH and blood gas alterations, previously shown to influence the normal ventricular fibrillation threshold, do not significantly affect the normal defibrillation threshold.\n",
      "Pleural effusion associated with aortitis syndrome. A patient with aortitis syndrome had a pleural effusion which subsided but reappeared with an exacerbation of aortitis symptoms while under antituberculosis treatment. The character of the fluid was that of an exudate, and the glucose concentration was normal. Clinical and laboratory features of the case suggest that the effusion was part of the aortitis syndrome per se.\n",

      "Charge properties of human pituitary and amniotic fluid prolactins. The apparent isoelectric points (pI) in isoelectric focusing (IF) of human pituitary and amniotic fluid prolactin (hPRL), both non-iodinated and iodinated, were determined. Unresolved mixtures of pituitary hPRL isohormones E and F, and of at least five isohormones found in amniotic fluid, and plasma hPRL exhibit an average pI value of 6.5 - 6.7. Transient state pH values observed or previously reported for hPRL components range from pH 5.9 to 6.8 after correction to standard conditions. At pH 8.1, the major isohormone, hPRL-F, carriers a charge of 2.2 net protons per molecule. The net charge differences among isohormones E, F and G are compatible with acquisition or loss of single charged groups per 20,000 molecular weight. This net charge is similar to that of the least prolactin-bioactive major isohormone of human growth hormone (hGH-B), while the hGH with a bioactivity comparable to that of hPRL exhibits a net charge of 3.4 valence units. The \"large\" isohormones J and H increased net charges, by a factor of 2-3, in direct proportion to their size increments.\n",
      "Human and monkey prolactin and growth hormone: separation of polymorphic forms by isoelectric focusing. The feasibility of using isoelectric focusing for the separation of primate pituitary growth hormone from prolactin and for the characterization of polymorphic forms of these hormones was explored. In a pH 3--10 gradient, extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into 4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components, as shown by radioimmunoassay. In narrower gradients (of 2--3 pH units) greater resolution was achieved; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components. A partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain 4 prolactin components, one of which had a prolactin/growth hormone ratio of 760. Clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin and 5 growth hormone components, many of which had higher pI values than those found in pituitary extract. Under the conditions used, both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point. Some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2% growth hormone by radioimmunoassay. Monkey growth hormone containing 0.01% prolactin was isolated. These findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another. Furthermore, the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in preparations obtained by several methods and from 2 different species, suggesting that these forms are not artifacts.\n",
      "Ecological observation of the 137Cs-contamination in beef of animals from the southern-Bavarian area. Certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the Bavarian sub-alpine mountains and in the Alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and farm structures similar to those in the northern part of Scandinavia. In 1963/64, the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present, we established in 600 beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle (mainly Highland cattle) close connections between the 137Cs-contamination of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities, as well as certain relations between the 137Cs-contamination of meat and differences in the feeding and keeping of the animals. During summer-seasons (April-October), beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall (Alps) was contaiminated by 137Cs up to 15 times more than that of confined animals. Hereby the rate of 137Cs-contamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation. When confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for 2 to 3 weeks, a quick increase of 137Cs-contamination of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle. The lower 137Cs-content in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder, which is at that time less contaminated than green crop. During the winter season (November to March), the highest contaminations in the meat of confined (Bohemian Forest) or grazing cattle (Alps) was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy silage. The highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in January, February and March, as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed. Here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle. After the quick decrease of 137Cs in fallout noticed in the years 1964 and 1965, in 1965/66 a dependance in the 137Cs-contamination of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases (Alps, Bavarian- and Bohemian Forest); though in general, meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation.\n",
      "Liver microsomal beta-glucuronidase and UDP-glucuronyltransferase. Both UDP-glucuronyltransferase (GT) and beta-glucuronidase (betaG) were assayed in untreated liver microsomes. Optimum assay conditions were established with rat liver microsomes using p-nitrophenol (pNP) and its glucuronide (pNPGA) at the pH optima of GT (7.5) and betaG (4.5). The activities of the two enzymes were compared using microsomes from rats, mice, pigs, cattle and horses, with pNP, pNPGA, and phenolphthalein as substrate, in the presence of various cofactors and inhibitors at pH 7.5 and 4.5. These data disclose pronounced differences with respect to species, substrate and other experimental conditions, thereby precluding the establishment of general optimum conditions. The two enzymes were also assayed under strictly identical conditions using pNP and pNPGA and rat liver microsomes at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of UDP-glucuronate disodium (UDPGA), activators (ATP;UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and inhibitors. When provided with a functional level of UDPGA, both enzymes proved active under those conditions, and a conjugation-deconjugation interplay was indicated. The two processes could be selectively and totally inhibited by Zn2+ and saccharolactone. The results suggest that conjugation-deconjugation-reconjugation cycles may be operative in the metabolism of drugs in vivo, taking place already at the level of the liver endoplasmic reticulum.\n",
      "Biochemical aspects of renal ammonia formation in metabolic acidosis. In omnivorous creatures, the diet is acidogenic, especially as a result of the meat content, which gives rise to phosphoric and sulphuric acids, i.e., to metabolic acidosis. In the short term, metabolic acids are buffered by tissue proteins and bicarbonate (the 'alkali reserve'). In the longer term, acid must be excreted, or neutralized with base which is also generated from the diet, by conversion of dietary amino-nitrogen to ammonia. The final steps of this process occur in the kidney, which converts circulating glutamine to ammonia, and to carbon products such as glucose and carbon dioxide, by metabolic reactions which adapt during acidosis to generate more ammonia and maintain an increased renal ammonia content. The complex mechanisms which govern the formation of ammonia, glucose and carbon dioxide from glutamine, involving the reactions of amino acids, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconeogenesis, are reviewed.\n",
      "Studies on the mechanism of the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. I. Experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rabbits. Serum, liver and renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activities were studied in four groups of rabbits: controls, rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis, rabbits with obstructive anuria, and animals with combined obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis and obstructive anuria. Serum GGT was essentially increased in rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis, showing peak values in the combined cholestasis + obstructive anuria group, and practically normal values in animals with anuria. Liver GGT was increased in both cholestasis groups, but the increase was less prominent than the increase in serum GGT and there was no correlation between them. In both anuric groups renal GGT was reduced, probably as a result of inhibited enzyme synthesis secondary to the altered conditions for adequate renal function. The results obtained are suggestive of a probable renal involvement in the formation of the serum GGT activity level.\n",
      "Studies on the mechanism of the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. II. Experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits. The mechanism responsible for the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) activity was studied in a model of experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits. Porphyria followed the administration of hexachlorobenzene in doses of 280 mumol - kg-1 body weight, which were given daily through a gastric tube over a 20-day period. Serum gamma-GT activity and the activities of the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and alpha-mannosidase were increased, whereas L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered. There was a considerable increase in liver microsomal protein, gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450, anilinehydroxylase, aminopyrine-demethylase and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase. In the liver gamma-GT was detected in the microsomes as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher. The high correlation coefficient between liver gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450 and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase witnesses a hexachlorobenzene-induced gamma-GT formation in the liver. A statistically significant correlation between serum and liver gamma-GT activity was also found. These data strongly suggest that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver.\n",
      "Changes in erythrocyte 2,3 diphosphoglycerate in women following short term maximal exercise. 15 untrained women were subjected to a walking treadmill test to determine the influence of maximal exercise upon synthesis of erythrocyte 2,3 DPG. Although there was a 9.8% increase in the 2,3 DPG content following exercise, there was a concomitant 9.4% increase in the hemoglobin level; therefore, when 2,3 DPG is expressed as a ratio to hemoglobin (See Article), there was no significant change as a result of exercise stress. It was suggested that three additive factors produced during strenuous exercise; decreased pH; increased hemoglobin concentration; and increased CO2 production result in by-product inhibition of 2,3 DPG synthesis. It is concluded that 2,3 DPG does not provide a physiologic benefit in the adaptation of the oxygen transport system to exercise.\n",
      "Hydroxylation of p-Coumaric acid by illuminated chloroplasts. The role of superoxide. 1. Chloroplasts isolated from leaves of spinach-beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) do not catalyse the hydroxylation of p-coumaric acid in the dark unless a reductant (such as ascorbate, NADH or NADPH) is added. Superoxide dismutase has no effect on this reaction. 2. Illuminated chloroplasts catalyse the hydroxylation in the absence of added reductant. This reaction is completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase, but catalase has little effect. 3. Both hydroxylation in the light and hydroxylation in the dark in the presence of reductants are inhibited by diethyldithiocarbamate, EDTA, cyanide and 2-mercaptoethanol. 4. It is proposed that O-2- generated by illuminated chloroplasts is involved in the provision of a reductant to the enzyme phenolase.\n",
      "Identification of chloride-binding sites in hemoglobin by nuclear-magnetic-resonance quadrupole-relaxation studies of hemoglobin digests. 35Cl minus-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicate that various digests of human hemoglobin with carboxypeptidase A and B, or a combination of the two, may be used for the identification of chloride binding sites. All the digestion products contain, like hemoglobin itself, at least two classes of binding sites, one of high, the others of low affinity. The pH dependence of the excess linewidth of the 35Cl minus NMR signal indicates that in the simple digests with either carboxypeptidase A or B, chloride is bound with high affinity at or near His-beta146-Asp-beta94 and at or near Val-alpha1-Arg-alpha141. The high-affinity sites show, in the case of the simple digests, a strong oxygen linkage which is lost in the forms digested with both carboxypeptidase A and B; this linkage may thus be correlated to the presence of conformational changes. Organic phosphates, like inositol hexaphosphate, show competition for some of the high-affinity chloride binding sites in hemoglobin and in the simple digests. This competition is likewise lost in the doubly digested hemoglobins.\n",
      "The internal-alkaline pH gradient, sensitive to uncoupler and ATPase inhibitor, in growing Clostridium pasteurianum. 1. The intracellular pH was measured in growing Clostridium pasteurianum with and acid-base equilibrium distribution method. [14C]Dimethyloxazolidinedione, [14]methylamine and [14C]acetic acid were used as \"deltapH-indicators\". During growth the extracellular pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.1; simultaneously the intracellular pH changed from 7.5 to 5.9. Thus, the intracellular pH was more alkaline than the extracellular pH by 0.4 to 0.8 pH-units. 2. This pH gradient (interior alkaline) was abolished by the proton conductor carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The pH gradient could not be demonstrated in cells depleted of an energy substrate. These results suggest that the pH gradient is formed by an ATPase-driven extrusion of protons from the cells rather than by a Donnan potential. 3. Growth of the organism was inhibited by low concentrations of both carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (5 muM) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (5 muM). This finding suggests that the pH gradient is essential for the growing cell as it may be required for substrate accumulation and other types of transport processes.\n",
      "D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase in the bacterial form and L-form of Proteus mirabilis. Membranes of the bacterial form and the stable and unstable L-forms of Proteus mirabilis contain LD and DD-carboxypeptidase. The DD-carboxypeptidase is inhibited non-competitively by penicillin G. The enzyme of the bacterial form is highly penicillin-sensitive (Ki - 4 X 10(-9) M penicillin G). Inhibition is only partly reversible by treatment with penicillinase or by dialysis against buffer. In contrast, the DD-carboxypeptidase of the unstable L-form, grown in the presence of penicillin, is 175-fold less penicillin-sensitive (Ki = 7 X 10(7) M penicillin G). Inhibition is completely reversed by penicillinase or dialysis. After inhibition by penicillin and subsequent reactivation the penicillin sensitivity of the bacterial DD-carboxtpeptidase is similar to the sensitivity of the enzyme of the unstable L-form. The hypothesis is proposed that P. mirabilis contains two DD-carboxypeptidases of different penicillin sensitivity and with different mechanisms of penicillin binding. Peptidoglycan synthesis in the cell walls of the unstable L-form is probably carried out with the help of only one DD-carboxypeptidase, viz. the completely reactivatable enzyme with the lower penicillin sensitivity.\n",
      "Pigeon-liver NAD kinase. The structural and kinetic basis of regulation of NADPH. NAD kinase was purified from pigeon liver by an improved procedure which included chromatography on phosphocellulose. The resultant preparation was homogeneous as judged by gel electrophoresis, but electrofocusing gave indications of heterogeneity. The enzyme appeared to be of molecular weight 270000, and to consist of subunits of molecular weight 34000; it may therefore be an octomer. Kinetic studies over a wide range of substrate concentrations revealed departures from Michaelis-Menten behaviour with the substrate NAD+; these were interpreted tentatively in terms of negative homotropic interactions between identical binding sites, since thermal and chemical inactivation studies revealed no evidence for more than one type of catalytic site. The significance of the kinetics and of the type of inhibition produced by NADPH is discussed in terms of the regulation of NAD kinase activity in vivo.\n",
      "Hydrogen ion changes and contractile behavior in the perfused rat heart. The effect of acid-base alterations was analyzed using isolated rat hearts perfused at constant coronary perfusion pressure, and stimulated to contract at constant rat. The amount of shortening in the major axis and its derivative were measured to assess myocardial contractility. Both the 'respiratory' and 'metabolic' alterations affected the contractile behavior to the same extent. In the physiological range studied by us, acidosis depresses and alkalosis increases myocardial contraction. However acidosis seems to depress contractility more than the enhancement produced by the same change in pH towards the alkalotic side. When either amount of shortening or max dl/dt was plotted as a function of hydrogen ion acitvity (aH+) a linear correlation was obtained, either with pure 'metabolic' or 'respiratory' acid-base induced alterations (correlation coefficients higher than -.95; P less than .01). Our findings suggest that in the range studied by us, contraction of the perfused rat heart following acid-base alterations, is a linear function of hydrogen ion activity.\n",
      "Changes of EEG and pulmonary venous admixture during a protein load in patients with cirrhosis. 21 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and 24 control patients were studied before and after a protein load (120 g protein per day during one week). An EEG was recorded and a visual assessment of frequency pattern was performed. Venous admixture was estimated during hyperoxia. According to the EEG frequency pattern the patient group with cirrhosis was subdivided into those with EEG slowing after the protein load (n = 7) and those without (n = 14). The following results were obtained: 1) Resting arterial blood gases did not change in either group. 2) There was a significant increase of the AaD02 (difference between alveolar p02 and peripheral arterial p02) in cirrhotics and controls. 3) The increase in AaD02 was significantly larger in those cirrhotics showing EEG slowing compared to those without EEG - slowing or to the controls. 4) Fractional venous admisture increased significantly in those cirrhotics showing EEG slowing. There was no significant change in those patients who did not show EEG changes or in the controls.\n",
      "An evaluation of factors affecting the in vitro bioassay for erythropoietin. Two main aspects of the in vitro mouse foetal liver cell assay for Erythroid Stimulating Factor (ESF) in human sera have been investigated. The haem extraction process has been shown to give specific and quantitative recovery of 59Fe labelled haem from haemoglobin thus confirming that the material assayed in human sera is stimulating the synthesis of this protein. The extraction procedure can be simplified considerably by prior mixing of the reagents without significantly influencing the results. Several serum constituents (citrate, testosterone, B12, folic acid and iron) have been investigated over a range of concentrations for possible effects on the cultures. Generally only small effects on haem synthesis were observed. It is concluded that variations in the levels of these factors in sera from treated patients will not produce any significant alterations in the estimated ESF concentrations.\n",

      "[Mechanisms of the thermogenic action of noradrenaline during adaptation to cold]. In white rats both adapted and unadapted to cold, the RQ dynamics during cold exposure, noradrenaline and ganglion blocking agent administration, were studied. The adapted animals' RQ in thermoneutral conditions was shown to be a little higher than in the control rats; 0.5 mg/kg noradrenaline injections induced a clear RQ decrease in the former and did not influence the latters' RQ. Cold exposure was followed by a RQ decrease in both. Ganglion blocking agent administration decreased the RQ in the adapted animals and prevented it from falling in the control those. Noradrenaline is supposed to be the main but not the only factor activating lipolysis in the cold adapted animals.\n",
      "Chromosomal basis of the merozygosity in a partially deploid mutant of Pneumococcus. A sulfonamide-resistant mutant of pneumococcus, sulr-c, displays a genetic instability, regularly segregating to wild type. DNA extracts of derivatives of the strain possess transforming activities for both the mutant and wild-type alleles, establishing that the strain is a partial diploid. The linkage of sulr-c to strr-61, a stable chromosomal marker, was established, thus defining a chromosomal locus for sulr-c. DNA isolated from sulr-c cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wild-type recipient, although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating classical \"low-efficiency\" donor markers equally as efficiently as \"high efficiency\" markers. Hence sulr-c must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations. We suggest that the DNA in the region of the sulr-c mutation has a structural abnormality which leads both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently mediating genetic transformation.\n",
      "Recombination as a requirement for segregation of a partially diploid mutant of Pneumococcus. Conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain sulr-c, resistant to the drug sulfanilamide, gives rise to sensitive segregants resistant to nitrobenzoic acid at a frequency constant with time. This segregant frequency is markedly enhanced upon exposure of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or mitomycin C that permit survival of 50% to 90% of the cells. Treatment with acridine orange diminishes the segregant frequency. From the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination, we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of segregants.--During a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin C, cell division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored. Thus potential segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection, or they are under-represented among the cells dividing soon after treatment.--If the sulr-c mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an ATP-dependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming DNA, segregant frequencies are unaffected. This fact may indicate limits upon the type of recombination event responsible for segregation.\n",

A patient is reported with mast cell infiltration of the small intestine in the absence of the skin involvement characteristic of mast cell disease.

      "Gastric pH and microflora of normal and diarrhoeic infants. The microflora and pH of gastric contents were determined in breast-fed and in bottle-fed normal infants, in well nourished infants with acute diarrhoea and in infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition. The last group of infants was reevaluated after recovery from diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition. A bactericidal pH effect below 2-5 was observed. Bottle-fed controls had low pH values and low bacterial concentrations, whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition had high pH values and bacterial overgrowth, essentially of Gram-negative bacilli. After recovery, the only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of yeast-like fungi in low concentrations. Infants with acute diarrhoea, except for the isolation more frequently of yeast-like fungi, presented no alterations; this seems to indicate that pH alterations and Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state. Breast-fed normal infants had hydrogen-ion concentrations similar to those of the chronic diarrhoea group, but without Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth, suggesting that other factors, besides pH, regulate bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants.\n",
      "[Biphasic (ulcer-forming and ulcer-preventing) effect of adrenaline in rats]. Adrenaline-induced gastric ulceration was studied in rats. Adrenaline in high doses caused gastric ulcer, which was completely blocked by pretreatment with alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine), but not by pretreatment with propranolol or atropine, nor by vagotomy, hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy. After successive administration of adrenaline, once daily for 7 days, however, no gastric ulcer was observed. Recovery from the ulcerogenic action of adrenaline was seen after 4 weeks withdrawal. Pretreatment with a small dose of adrenaline inhibited the ulcerogenic action of a high dose of adrenaline. Pretreatment with reserpine, pyrogallol or iproniazid inhibited the action of adrenaline. It is concluded that adrenaline has a biphasic effect on gastric ulceration, the ulcerogenic action is due to its alpha-action and antiulcerogenic effect is due to development of tachyphylaxis.\n",
      "[Comparison of drug effects on the isolated rat colon and duodenum]. Adrenaline and isoproterenol elicited nearly maximal relaxation of the colon even in small doses, whereas increase in the doses caused greater relaxation in the duodenum. In the colon, these drugs prevented, to a great extent the contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin but in the duodenum were totally ineffective. Dibenamine and propranolol reduced adrenaline- and isoproterenol-induced relaxation in the duodenum, though propranolol decreased the relaxation caused by isoproterenol. Atropine prevented ACh-induced contraction in both the colon and duodenum in the same way. After 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide, duodenal contraction caused by ACh or serotonin decreased by over 70%; however, the contraction of the colon was not significantly inhibited. Methysergide had similar effects, but to a lesser degree. In calcium-free bathing fluid without addition of Na2EDTA, ACh and prostaglandin E1 elicited contraction in the colon, but not in the duodenum.\n",
      "[Monoamine oxidase (XXXVI). Characteristics of benzylamine oxidase in the dog serum]. Enzymic properties of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in dog serum were studied and the following results were obtained. Some of enzymic properties of MAO in dog serum differed from that of mitochondrial MAO. When dog serum was fractionated by ammonium sulfate, proteins were concentrated in two fractions, such as 25 approximately 33% and 67 approximately 80% of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction, while MAO activity was concentrated in 40 approximately 50% of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction. The reaction rate of MAO in dog serum was found to be proportional to enzyme concentration. The optimum pH of MAO in dog serum was 7.0 which differed from that of MAO in rabbit serum (pH 8.0). Tris-HCl buffer strongly inhibited MAO activity in dog serum. When benzylamine was used as substrate, the highest activity was obtained compared with the other substrate used. The activities with butylamine, amylamine, beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine showed about 30% while tryptamine and serotonin showed 3 approximately 10% compared to that with benzymlamine as substrate. The value of pI50 of catron was about 3 X 10(-6) M and that of harmaline was about 3 X 10(-5) M, but pargyline did not inhibit MAO activity in dog serum at the concentration of 1 X 10(-4) M.\n",
      "[Combined use of bucolome and pyrazolone derivatives (1). Pharmacological activities and blood concentration]. A combination of two or more drugs may exert a drug-drug interaction, in which case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized. Such synergistic effects are well known in the case of pyrabital (barbital + aminopyrine) or irgapyrine (phenylbutazone + aminopyrine). Bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula of pheylbutazone. Thus the influence of BCP combination on the pharmacological activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined. BCP potentiated the analgesic and antipyretic effects of 4-aminoantipyrine (4A), methylaminoantipyrine (MA), aminopyrine (AM) and isopropylaminoantipyrine (IPA), which were substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring. This potentiation occurred when the dose of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP and pyrazolone was 2:1 mola. The analgesic effects of antipyrine (AN), isopropylantipyrine (IP) and aminopropylone (AP), which were substituted by alkyl group or aminoacylamino group at 4-position, were not potentiated by BCP in any combination ratio. Most pyrazolones showed additive acute toxicity in their combination with BCP, but acute toxicities of 4A and AM, which were potentiated in analgesic effects, were decreased and antagonized when combined with BCP. The plasma concentration of AM was increased and prolonged by BCP, while that of IP remained much the same. These results suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular interactions between BCP and pyrazolones, which are substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring.\n",
      "[Combined use of bucolome and pyrazolone derivatives (II). Complex formation due to interaction between bucolome and pyrazolones]. We have already reported that bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, potentiates significantly the analgesic and antipyretic effects of pyrazolones which are substituted by alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring. Physical and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of this synergistic action. The solubility of BCP was markedly increased in proportion to elevation of aminopyrine (AM) concentration, but not by a combination with isopropylantipyrine (IP). The binding of BCP to bovine serum albumin was slightly inhibited by AM, but not by IP. The mixture of AM and BCP in aqueous media generated optical absorption in the ultraviolet differential spectrum, due to the charge transfer interaction. The results of the infrared or NMR spectrum demonstrated the formation of a hydrogen binding in non-aqueous media between BCP and AM. From the calculation of the charge on an atom, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the frontier electron density, BCP is considered to be a good electron acceptor. The beta-units of Mho of pyrazolones were found to correlate with the potentiation coefficient of analgesic activity in combination drugs. These results suggest that the complex formation between BCP and pyrazolones is an important factor for the synergism of action and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen binding of both molecules.\n",

FDP aldolase was found to be present in the cell-free extracts of Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium phaseoli, Rhizobium trifolii, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium lupini, Rhizobium japonicum and Rhizobium species from Arachis hypogaea and Sesbania cannabina. The enzyme in 3 representative species has optimal activity at pH 8.4 in 0.2M veronal buffer. The enzyme activity was completely lost by treatment at 60 degrees C for 15 min. The Km values were in the range from 2.38 to 4.55 X 10(-6)M FDP. Metal chelating agents inhibited enzyme activity, but monovalent or bivalent metal ions failed to stimulate the activity. Bivalent metal ions in general were rather inhibitory.\n",
      "Prevention of cell agglutination and competence in a genetically transformable strain of Pneumococcus by D-glucosamine and D-galactosamine. In the presence of amino sugars D-glucosamine and D-galactosamine no spontaneous competence could be observed in the highly transformable R6bd strain of Pneumococcus or it was decreased by several orders of magnitude. The highest inhibition of competence was detected when the amino sugar at a concentration 5 mg/ml of the medium was added not only to the transformation but also to the pretransformation medium. After a 150 min growth in the transformation medium in the presence of the amino sugar a 3--4-fold greater number of cells (as a viable count) could be detected as compared with the control without the amino sugar. It was found microscopically that the amino sugar prevents natural agglutination, which normally occurs in the competent culture. The role of specific amino sugar determinants for binding of the competence factor on the cell surface and the resulting inhibitory effect of these sugars on the development of competence are discussed.\n",
      "Effect of some aldoses on growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited with molybdenum. The inhibitory effect of molybdenum ions on growth of yeasts at pH 5.5 was found to be decreased by aldoses in the following order: D-talose greater than L-mannose greater than L-ribose greater than D-lyxose greater than L-galactose greater than L-arabinose greater than L-glucose greater than L-xylose. Increased concentrations of molybdenum brought about morphological changes of yeast cells. Cells grown under these conditions were smaller, had thicker walls and formed clusters.\n",
      "Transport properties of membrane vesicles from Acholeplasma laidlawii. II. Kinetic characteristics and specificity of glucose transport system. The glucose transport system of membrane vesicles isolated from Acholeplasma laidlawii is saturable, with a Km of 21.2 mum and V of 0.68 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1. The process is pH-dependent and a break occurs in the Arrhenius plot at 15 degrees C. Exogenous substrates did not stimulate glucose transport probably due to their inability to penetrate into membrane vesicles. 3-O-Methylglucose and 6-deoxyglucose competitively inhibited glucose transport. Maltose inhibited transport of glucose noncompetitively. These sugars also elicited glucose efflux from preloaded membrane vesicles.\n",
      "Transport of 4-deoxy- and 6-deoxy-D-glucose in baker's yeast. Tritium-labelled 4-deoxy-D-glucose (4-dglc) and 6-deoxy-D-glucose (6-dgcl) were prepared by catalytic hydrogenolysis of the corresponding deoxyiodo derivatives with gaseous tritium. The two sugars are transported into Saccharomyces cerevisiae by both the constitutive glucose and the inducible galactose carrier. Uranyl ions are powerful inhibitors. The pH optimum in uninduced cells lies at 5.5 for both sugars, the apparent activation energies (between 15 and 35 degrees C) are 25.1 kJ/mol and 16.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The steady-state intracellular concentration of both sugars is less than the extracellular one (no uphill transport). Neither of them is a substrate of yeast hexokinase. 4-Deoxy-D-glucose undergoes a dinitrophenol-sensitive conversion to an unknown metabolite which is not phosphorylated and may represent one of its oxidation products.\n",
      "Gluconic acid production by Penicillium puberulum. Twenty-five Penicillium species isolated from Egyptian soil were examined for their ability to produce gluconic acid in surface culture. Of the eight species capable of producing gluconic acid, Penicillium puberulum gave the maximum yield (91% gluconic acid from glucose after 7 days of fermentation with 3% CaCO3). Peptone was the best nitrogen source for acid fermentation and glucose was superior to sucrose. Addition of low concentrations of KH2PO4 and MgSO4 - 7 H2O stimulated acid production. An initial pH of 6.1 was most favourable for acid accumulation and addition of CaCO3 was necessary for maximum acid production.\n",
      "A simple method of isolation and purification of cultures of wood-rotting fungi. A simple method of isolation and purification of cultures of higher fungi, mainly wood-rotting fungi, without special requirements for the presence of nitrogencontaining nutrients is described. Parts of fruiting bodies, spores or infected wood is inoculated on Petri dishes with an agar medium of the following composition: 1.0 g KH2PO4, 0.2 g MgSO4 - 7 H2O, 0.1 g caSO4, 0.01 g Fe2(SO4)3, 10.0 g glucose, tap water to 1 litre; 20.0 g agar. This medium does not suit most of the contaminants but fungal hyphae overgrow the whole surface of the dish so that a purified culture can be obtained from parts distant from the inoculation site.\n",
      "[Studies on low volume priming heart lung bypass (author's transl)]. This report concerns the feasibility of low volume priming extracorporeal circulation. Through this study, the bubble oxygenator with Zuhdi's heat exchange was used. Moderate hypothermia with surface cooling and hemodilution perfusion with 5 per cent D/W was evaluated in 32 mongrel dogs and 16 clinical open heart cases. The results obtained here were as follow: 1) Body temperature reduction by surface cooling before bypass provided more even cooling than did core cooling by low flow partial bypass alone. 2) In regard to cardiac loading on returning the whole perfusate of the circuit to patient, approximately 20 ml/kg of 5 per cent D/W was feasible as a priming solution. 3) To reduce the blood visicosity, hemodilution technique with 5 per cent D/W was superior, and hemodilution effect during postoperative periods was temporaly. 4) The excess lactate volume postulated by Huckabee was a available index to evaluate metabolic acidosis during the extracorporeal circulation. 5) With aid of surface cooling, the acid-base balance during perfusion was kept to lesser extent than that of core cooling only. 6) This study indicated that the low priming perfusion in conjunction with surface cooling hypothermia was a reliable technique for the open heart operation and may be applied in more prolonged perfusion.\n",
      "[Studies on extracorporeal circulation with large volume hemodilution using lactate ringer's solution and low molecular weight dextran: alterations of acid-base balance associated with intentional hemodilution (author's transl)]. Twenty mongrel dogs, weighing between 7.5 and 13.0 kg were used to investigate the percentage limits permissible for hemodilution using a double-helical reservoir heart-lung machine which has a 1,100 ml of priming volume. In both 40 and 50 per cent groups of intentional hemodilution by 30 minute extracorporeal circulation, remarkable anemia was inevitable and recovery was extremely slow, especially in the 50 per cent dilution group. In both 40 and 50 per cent groups of intentional hemodilutions by 30 minute extracorporeal circulation, metabolic acidosis was observed. In 50 per cent group of intentional hemodilution, no improvement of metabolic acidosis was observed even after perfusion. When sodium bicarbonate was administered to 40 per cent hemodilution group, minimum alterations of acid-base balance and of serum electrolytes were observed during and after extracorporeal perfusion. When sodium bicarbonate was administered to 50 per cent hemodilution group, metabolic acidosis was more evident than in 40 per cent hemodilution group accompanied with an increase in serum sodium concentration and a decrease in serum chloride concentration. These data qualify the use of 40 per cent intentional hemodilution using Lactate Ringer's solution or low molecular weight dextran for 30 minute extracorporeal circulation when sodium bicarbonate is administered in adequate amounts.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of phosphodiesterase from Crotalus venom. A procedure for the purification of phosphodiesterase from Crotalus venom on DEAE-cellulose at alkaline pH is described. The enzyme gives a single band in polyacrylamide gels and is free of contaminating nucleolytic enzymes. The molecular weight is about 115000. Concentration in an Amicon ultrafiltrator gave a highly concentrated active enzyme. Phosphodiesterase is relatively stable and can be stored at 4 degrees C in the presence of Mg2 and serum albumin for years. For the detection of contaminating endonuclease, an assay was used in which tRNA was the substrate and possible internal breaks were detected in polyacrylamide gel after denaturation. With bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate as substrate, 15mM Mg2 was necessary for optimal activity. The reaction remained linear for at least 15 min at 22 degrees C. At 45 degrees C, the liberation of p-nitrophenol was highest within 25 min of incubation. At 75 degrees C, inactivation of the enzyme occurred after 4 min.\n",
      "Limited hydrolysis of tRNA by phosphodiesterase. Digestion of tRNA by electrophoretically pure phosphodiesterase is limited to a short sequence of nucleotides at the 3'-terminus. On the average, four percent of all nucleotides can be released from tRNA. The optimum Mg2 concentration is 10mM and the optimum pH 9.2. The mode of action is a random attack by the enzyme on the substrate. The terminal AMP is completely removed at 15 degrees C after short incubation; about 400 mol of AMP were removed per min by 1 mol of enzyme. The following CMP residues are released much more slowly; at 15 degrees C incompletely, and at 37 degrees C more or less completely in 1 h. In about 50% of the tRNA molecules, the fourth nucleotide could be removed in very long incubations or with very high enzyme concentrations.\n",
      "Ecdysone Oxidase, an enzyme from the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala (Meigen). In the blowfly, the formation of 3-dehydroecdysone from the insect molting hormone ecdysone is catalyzed by an enzyme which carries hydrogen from ecdysone and ecdysterone to oxygen. The enzyme is therefore called \"ecdysone oxidase\". Two methods are described for the detection of ecdysone oxidase activity, one using a radiolabelled substrate which is separated from the product by thin-layer chromatography after the reaction, and the other using dichloroindophenol, which is discoloured by the redox reaction. The ecdysone oxidase is purified by a factor of 2200 from prepupae of Calliphora erythrocephala using salt precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. The ecdysone oxidase has a Km value for ecdysone of 42muM. The pH optimum is 6.5. The temperature optimum lies at 45 degrees C. The ecdysone oxidase has a molecular weight of 240000.\n",
      "Using a hospital for desensitization of an outpatient's illness-related fears. An outpatient with phobias related to enclosed places, hospitals, doctors, and cancer was treated by systematic desensitization; the facilities of a general hospital were used for part of the process. Steps in treatment included securing a complete psychiatric and social history, teaching the patient relaxation therapy techniques, and establishing a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking stimuli specifically related to the patient's fears. After desensitization the patient was able to enter the hospital for tests for a physical ailment and showed a general decrease in her fears.\n",
      "Analysis of immunosuppression generated by the graft-versus-host reaction. I. A suppressor T-cell component studied in vivo. The kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in (CBA-p X C57/Bl)F1 mice during graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction induced with spleen cells from either parental strain have been investigated. Effects on PFC responses to thymus-dependent (chicken red blood cells) and independent (levan) antigens have been compared. The unresponsive state which developed in GVH mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients. Furthermore, GVH spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system, but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the original donors (or their cells) were still totally refractory after 80 days. This active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by T cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack. The delayed transfer of GVH cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen, indicated that suppressor T cells exert an anti-mitotic influence on antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation. Supplementation of macrophage-depleted, anti-theta-treated GVH spleen cells with purified normal T cells demonstrated that B cells in GVH mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by T cells is no longer demonstrable. The likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed.\n",
      "Pneumococcal type-associated variability in alternate complement pathway activation. Opsonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae may be mediated by the alternate complement pathway. To study the importance of this interaction to human disease, complement consumption by pneumococci of various serotypes was measured in humwn serum chelated with ethyleneglycoltraacetic acid, a substance that blocks the classic but not the alternate complement pathwway. Serotype I, in contrast to all other types studied, lacked ability to consume complement in this system. The ability for serotypes III, IV, and VIII to activate the alternate pathway could be eliminated by prior serum absorption at O C with they type in question, a condition that would remove antibody but not complement. Types VII, XII, XIV, and XXV readily activated the alternate pathway in unabsorbed and absorbed sera. Differences could not be related to properties of the capsules. It was concluded that types I, III, IV, and VIII lack intrinsic ability to activate and thus be opsonized by the alternate complement pathway, although types III, IV, and VIII can do so in concert with specific antibody. The fact that these same types are especially prominent in human disease suggests that the ability to evade opsonization by the alternate complement pathway in pre-antibody phases of infection may be a virulence factor in pneumococci.\n",
      "Conditions for production, and some characteristics, of mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor produced by spleen cells from mice immunized with viable cells of the attenuated H37Ra strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor (MycoIF), found in supernatant fluids of mouse spleen cell cultures that have been stimulated in vitro with homologous  antigen, inhibited the intracellular multiplication of virulent tubercle bacilli within normal mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Antigenically stimulated H37Ra-immunized mouse spleen cells required 72 h of incubation to produce supernatant fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition. Supernatant fluids from 48-h mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular inhibition. Investigation of the culture conditions showed that at lease 1.0% human serum was required in the tissue culture medium for the production of MycoIF by spleen cells from immunized mice. MycoIF activity was noted only in supernatant fluids from spleen cell cultures incubated with antigen for 72 h. MycoIF was nondialyzable and unaffected by freezing, lyophilization, or incubation at 60 C for 30 min. However, MycoIF was inactivated after incubation at 80 C for 30 min. MycoIF was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 7 to 12), but exposure to higher hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 6, pH 5) significantly decrease MycoIF activity, and exposure to pH 4 to 2 abolished all activity. Supernatant fluids diluted 1:32 were still able to produce significant intracellular inhibition of growth of virulent tubercle bacilli.\n",
      "Effect of pneumococci on blood clotting, platelets, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and products from the organism have been associated with alterations in blood clotting and function of platelets. Pneumococci and pneumococcal polysaccharide shortened the clotting times of whole blood, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) in vitro. Clotting times of PPP and PRP from C6-deficient animals were likewise decreased. The bacteria had no effect on the  one-stage prothrombin time or the partial thromboplastin time when the organisms were used as activating agents. Platelets aggregated in the presence of pneumococci,  but aggregation was prevented by the addition of cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, cAMP corrected the shortened clotting time of PRP in the presence of pneumococci. The clumping and release of polymorphonuclear coagulant that was induced by pneumococci was not prevented by cAMP. Thus, pneumococci exert several dose-dependent thromboplastic effects: (i) release of platelet thromboplastic substances; (ii) a direct thromboplastic effect; and (iii) release of polymorphonuclear coagulant.\n",
      "Some properties of a D-alanine carboxypeptidase in envelope fractions of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Envelope preparations of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain GC1 (a stable, piliated strain of intermediate colony morphology) and type T1 possess a D-alanine carboxypeptidase which releases the terminal alanine residue from the uridine 5'-diphosphate-N-acetyl muramylpentapeptide substrate (isolated from Bacillus cereus T). The D-alanine carboxypeptidase of the GC1 envelopes has a broad pH optimum between pH 8.0 to 10.0. When the molarity of the tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer was varied, the activity showed an optimum over the range 0.2 to 0.4 M. Activity was higher (135% of control level) when 20 to 80 mM Mg2+ was present. The Km for the enzyme was 0.25 mM. The D-alanine carboxypeptidase was inhibited by several beta-lactam antibiotics and the 50% inhibitory levels were 10(-8) M penicillin G, 10(-8) M ampicillin, 10(-5) M cloxacillin, and 5 x 10(-7) M methicillin.\n",
      "Host defense against the pneumococcus in T-lymphocyte-deficient, nude mice. Resistance to pneumococcal infection was tested in T-lymphocyte-deficient, nude (nu/nu) mice. Pneumococcal serum opsonizing activity, in vivo phagocytosis of the pneumococcus, and the mean lethal dose for the pneumococcus were all found to be the same in nude mice as in control (+/+) mice. T-lymphocytes do not appear to play a significant role in the host's defense against the pneumococcus.\n",
      "Phenomenon of hot-cold hemolysis: chelator-induced lysis of sphingomyelinase-treated erythrocytes. Staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase C specific for sphingomyelin (beta-hemolysin). Erythrocytes with approximately 50% sphingomyelin in their membranes, e.g., from sheep, have been shown to have up to 60% of this phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at 37 C in isotonic buffered saline without hemolysis. Cooling of sphingomyelinase C-treated erythrocytes to 4 C causes complete lysis of the cells, a phenomenon known as hot-cold hemolysis. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to sheep erythrocytes preincubated with sphingomyelinase C was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 C. The treated cells became susceptible to chelator-induced hemolysis and to hot-cold hemolysis simultaneously, and the degree of lysis of both mechanisms increased equally with prolonged preincubation with sphingomyelinase C. Erythrocytes of species not readily susceptible to hot-cold hemolysis were equally insusceptible to chelator-induced lysis. Chelators of the EDTA series were the most effective, whereas chelators more specific for Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ were without effect. The rate of chelator-induced lysis was dependent on the preincubation period with beta-hemolysin and on the concentration of chelator added. The optimal concentration of EDTA was found to equal the amount of exogenously added Mg2+, a cation necessary for sphingomyelinase C activity. Hypotonicity increased the rate of chelator-induced hemolysis, whereas increasing the osmotic pressure to twice isotonic completely inhibited chelator-induced lysis. The data suggest that exogenously added and/or membrane-bound divalent cations are important for the stability of sphingomyelin-depleted membranes. The phenomenon of hot-cold hemolysis may be a consequence of the temperature dependence of divalent ion stabilization.\n",
      "In vitro antagonism of the mediators of allergy by a benzopyrano-benzopyran carboxylic acid PR-D-92-EA. PR-D-92-EA was tested on isolated guinea pig ileum and rat stomach strips for activity against mediators probably released after allergen antibody union. It antagonized the response produced by histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2ALPHA and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A). The concentrations which blocked 50% of the response were 150, 145, 92, 70, 47, and 32 mug/ml, respectively. This compound may be useful in the treatment of allergic conditions.\n",
      "Tyrosine aminotransferase induction in normal and tumor-bearing chickens. Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) induction by glucagon and dexamethasone in the liver of tumor-bearing chickens was studied and compared with induction in healthy animals. The transplantable tumor was caused by inoculation of cells from a cell line induced by MC29 avian leukosis virus. TAT was hardly detectable in tumor tissue of control and dexamethasone-treated chickens, but it was induced by glucagon to levels which were significant although very low when compared to those in host liver or the liver of non-tumor-bearing controls after glucagon treatment. Dexamethasone failed to induce TAT in host liver at 8 A.M. while it significantly indiced TAT in the normal liver at the same time of the day. Similar failure of TAT induction was not detectable when glucagon was used instead of dexamethasone. Furthermore, it was found that diurnal variations in basal and dexamethasone or glucagon-induced TAT levels are considerably mitigated in host liver as compared to those observed in the liver of healthy animals. The possible reasons for these findings are discussed.\n",
      "A behavior modification training program for staff working with drug addicts. This paper described a Behavior Modification Training Program, emphasizing self-control, for staff working with drug addicts. The program, which is primarily geared toward the training of paraprofessionals, takes place in ten 1-1/2 hour sessions and includes an overview of behavior modification as well as instruction in techniques of relaxation, desensitization, self-image improvement, behavior analysis, behavior control, assertive training, rational thinking, and how to set up and run similar behavior modification training programs for staff and patients. Since this training began at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute in November 1971, a total of 898 staff members, mostly paraprofessionals working with addicts, alcoholics, mentally ill patients, and inmates, including 53 from our own institution, 576 persons from other facilities in New Jersey, and 269 from facilities in other states, have been trained, while 2,021 patients have been trained in similar programs. Most of this training has been accomplished by paraprofessionals. Preliminary evaluation data have been promising and the response of participants enthusiastic.\n",
      "A kinetic study of the hydrolysis of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester. Hydrolysis rates of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester (methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate) and related model compounds were measured in aqueous, organic and mixed aqueous media. Adding dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to water, retarded hydrolysis of the ester by a factor of 2 to 500, depending on the pH of the medium and concentration of DMSO. Ethanol also slowed hydrolysis, but the effect was not so pronounced. Related studies show that the acetamido group C-N bond of sodium 2-acetamido-acrylate is hydrolyzed only about 1/130 as fast as the ester group C-O bond. Aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide should by a useful medium for synthesis of peptide, amino acid and protein derivatives of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester.\n",

In order for the ophthalmologist to achieve the greatest earning power and personal satisfaction, he or she must devise traffic flow techniques that efficiently allow for maximum utilization of all examining areas and paramedical personnel in the office without dehumanizing patients. By delegating as much responsibility as possible to staff, the ophthalmologist will have the opportunity of performing his or her specialized skills to the fullest extent, and therefore will achieve optimal personal gratification. This emotional reward indemnifies the future of private practice, because it can exist only in the presence of a close patient-physician relationship, which is the cornerstone of the private practice of ophthalmology.\n",
      "Computer evaluation of the effect of urecholine on the spontaneous activity of smooth muscle from the urinary bladder of the rabbit. The spontaneous activity exhibited in vitro by smooth muscle strips from the urinary bladder of the rabbit under the influence of Urecholine in concentrations from 0.3 to 30 muM has been characterized in terms of three parameters: mean tension, frequency of contraction, and contractile deviation, all obtained by computer an alysis. While mean tension and frequency monotonically increased with concentration, the contractile deviation rose to a peak in the vicinity of 3.0 to 6.0 muM and thereafter decreased. At concentrations less than 10 muM the contractile patterns were almost periodic, while at 10 and 30 muM, the patterns became highly erratic. Histologic examination of a limited number of tissues showed longitudinally oriented muscle bundles with multiple anastomosing.\n",
      "Characteristics of the non-occluded form of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Non-occluded virions of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus of the alfalfa looper, Autographa californica, found in the medium of cell cultures of infected fall armyworm, Spodopter frugiperda, and in the hemolymph of infected S. frugiperda larvae were partially characterized by biological, chemical and physical methods. Also, the rate of appearance of the virions was studied in cell culture and the host insect to determine maximum virion production. Virions obtained from both sources were heat-sensitive, acid-labile and inactivated by several organic solvents. The non-occluded virions found in the insect cell culture fluid and in the hemolymph were identical, and both were enveloped nucleocapsids. Visualization of the fragilely enveloped nucleocapsid was accomplished only after fixation with glutaraldehyde. Differences between the non-occluded and occluded virions of nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are discussed.\n",

This experiment provides further evidence that rubella is not an arbovirus, but does not invalidate its classification as a togavirus.\n",
      "Treatment of severe hypertension with minoxidil. Minoxidil in daily doses of 6 to 40 mg was administered to 11 patients with severe hypertension. Two patients died of causes unrelated to the drug and one patient withdrew from the study. Blood pressure was controlled in the remaining eight subjects, who received the drug for periods ranging from 5 to 40 months. In three patients minoxidil could subsequently be replaced by conventional antihypertensive therapy. Adverse effects of minoxidil included fluid retention (as assessed by edema and plasma volume studies), nonspecific ECG changes, hypertrichosis and conjunctival redness. Concomitant administration of diuretic and beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulted in excellent tolerance of the treatment and high patient compliance.\n",

      "Analysis of pesticides by chemical derivatization. I. a new procedure for the formation of 2-chloroethyl esters of ten herbicidal acids. A new esterification procedure was developed to form 2-chloroethyl esters for 10 common herbicidal acids, using dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and 2-chloroethanol. This reagent was found to be more desirable than the commonly used boron trichloride/2-chloroethanol reagent. Maximum esterification was given for picloram at a lower reaction temperature with a shorter reaction time. Also, maximum esterification of dicamba and 2,3,6-TBA was achieved. The boron trichloride/2-chlorethanol gave poor or little esterification with these 2 acids under the various conditions investigated. The effect of solvents on esterification with the 2 reagents was also explored.\n",
      "Local control of pulmonary resistance and lung compliance in the canine lung. Local control of pulmonary resistance and lung compliance was studied in the in situ left lower lobe of the canine lung. Recirculation of blood through the lobe while the Pco2 of the ventilatory gas was varied resulted in an increase in resistance and a decrease in compliance only when the pulmonary venous pH was greater than 7.42. Alternating sodium bicarbonate and lactic acid infusion while alveolar Pco2 was maintained below 5 mmHg demonstrated the dependence of the hypocapnic response on the acid-base status of the blood perfusing the respiratory airways. The increase in resistance and decrease in compliance observed at a pulmonary venous pH of 7.64 was comparable to that observed after lobar pulmonary artery occlusion. Varying degrees of hypoxia did not significantly affect bronchomotor tone, nor was the bronchoconstriction following lobar pulmonary artery occlusion affected by the hypoxia. Vagal stimulation superimposed on a stepwise increase in pulmonary venous pH from 7.32 to 7.62 resulted in an increase in resistance which paralleled the increase in resistance when pulmonary venous pH alone was increased. Compliance was not significantly affected by vagal stimulation at any level of pulmonary venous pH.\n",
      "Inactivation of citrate lyase from Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa by a specific deacetylase and inhibition of this inactivation by L-(+1-glutamate. A previously unrecognized enzyme, citrate lyase deacetylase, has been purified about 140-fold from cell extracts of Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa. It catalyzed the conversion of enzymatically active acetyl-S-citrate lyase into the inactive HS-form and acetate. The enzyme exhibited an optimal rate of inactivation at pH 8.1. Because of the instability of acetyl-S-citrate lyase at acidic and alkaline pH values, all assays were carried out at pH 7.2, where the spontaneous hydrolysis of the acetyl-S-citrate lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed 70% of the activity at pH 8.1. The apparent Km value for citrate lyase was 10(-7) M at pH 7.2 and 30 C. The activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the citrate lyase from R. gelatinosa. The corresponding lyases from Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Klebsiella aerogenes) and Streptococcus diacetilactis were not deacetylated; likewise, thioesters such as acetyl-S coenzyme A, acetoacetyl-S coenzyme A, and N-acetyl-S-acetyl-cysteamine were also not hydrolyzed. Citrate lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of R. gelatinosa grown with acetate or succinate; it was induced by citrate along with the citrate lyase. L-(+)-Glutamate strongly inhibited the deacetylase. Fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 1.4 X 10(-4) L-(+)-glutamate. D-(-)-Glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate, L-(-)-proline, and other metabolites were less effective.\n",
      "Novel type of murein transglycosylase in Escherichia coli. The purification and properties of a novel type of murein transglycosylase from Escherichia coli are described. The purified enzyme appears as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 65,000 as estimated by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis. It degrades pure murein sacculi from E. coli almost completely into low-molecular-weight products. The two prominent muropeptide fragments in the digest are the disaccharide-tripeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid and the corresponding disaccharide-tetrapeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine. The unique feature of these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and that the muramic acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 anhydro linkage. The new lytic enzyme is designated as a murein: murein transglycosylase. Its possible role in the rearrangement of murein during cell growth and division is discussed.\n",
      "Formation and cleavage of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase of Aspergillus niger. 2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase of Aspergillus niger, an enzyme that has not been reported previously, was purified 468-fold. Maximal activity was obtained at pH 8.0 and 50 C. The enzyme exhibited relative stereochemical specificity with respect to glyceraldehyde. The Km values for 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, glyceraldehyde, and pyruvate were 10, 13.3, and 3.0 mM, respectively. The effects of some compounds and inhibitors on enzyme activity were examined. Stability of the enzyme under different conditions was investigated. The equilibrium constant was about 0.33 X 10(-3) M.\n",
      "Chemotaxis of a motile Streptococcus toward sugars and amino acids. A motile Streptococcus was isolated and its chemotactic behavior toward sugars and amino acids was studied. Motility was optimal in the presence of an exogenous energy source and a nonionic detergent, e.g., Tween 80 or Brij-36. Both glucose and pyruvate could serve as energy source. Chemotaxis toward leucine was optimal at pH 7 to 8.5 and a temperature between 30 and 37 C. The Streptococcus showed a chemotactic response toward a variety of sugars. All commonly occurring L-amino acids, except alanine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, arginine, and lysine, were attractants. From concentration response curves the thresholds, peak concentrations, and optimal responses were determined.\n",
      "Phospholipase D activity of gram-negative bacteria. A phospholipase hydrolyzing cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in preparations of gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver mitochondria. In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.\n",
      "Pyridine nucleotide-linked oxidation of methanol in methanol-assimilating yeasts. An alcohol dehydrogenase linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and requiring glutathione has been isolated and partially purified from two methanol-assimilating yeasts. It differs from previously described methanol-oxidizing enzymes in pH optima, electron acceptor specificity, substrate specificity, inhibition pattern, and stability.\n",
      "Expression of the hut operons of Salmonella typhimurium in Klebsiella aerogenes and in Escherichia coli. The normal hut (histidine utilization) operons, as well as those with mutations affecting the regulation of their expression, of Salmonella typhimurium were introduced on an F' episome into cells of S. typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes whose chromosomal hut genes had been deleted and into cells of Escherichia coli, whose chromosome does not carry hut genes. The episomal hut operons respond in a manner very similar to induction and catabolite repression in all three organisms. The small differences found reflect both different abilities to take up inducers from the medium and different degrees of catabolite repression exerted by glucose.\n",
      "Regulation of the hut operons of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella aerogenes by the heterologous hut repressors. In merodiploid strains of Klebsiella aerogenes with chromosomal hut genes of K. aerogenes and episomal hut genes of Salmonella typhimurium, the repressor of either species can regulate the hut operons of the other species. The repression exerted by the homologous repressor on the left-hand hut operon is, in both organisms, stronger than that exerted by the heterologous repressor.\n",
      "Transport of molybdate by Clostridium pasteurianum. The transport of 99MoO42- into dinitrogen-fixing cells of Clostridium pasteurianum was investigated. Transport of molybdate in this organism is energy dependent; sucrose is required in the minimal media, and the system is inhibited by the glycolysis inhibitors, NaF, iodoacetic acid, and arsenate. The cells accumulate molybdate against a concentration gradient, and the uptake shows a marked dependence on temperature (optimum 37 C) and pH (optimum 6.0). The rate of molybdate uptake with increasing molybdate concentrations shows saturation kinetics with an apparent Km and Vmax of 4.8 X 10(-5) M and 55 nmol/g of dry cells per min, respectively. Inhibition studies with the anions SO42-, S2O32-, WO42-, and VO32- show that SO42- and WO42- competitively inhibit MoO42- uptake (apparent Ki [SO42-] is 3.0 X 10(-5) M; apparent Ki [WO42-] is 2.4 X 10(-5), whereas S2O32- and VO32- have no inhibitory effect. Exchange experiments with MoO42- show that only a small percentage of the 99MoO42- taken up by the cells is exchangeable. Exchange experiments with WO42- and SO42- indicate that once inside the cells WO42- and SO42- cannot substitute for MoO42-.\n",
      "3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase mutants of Salmonella typhimurium. The first committed step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium was shown to be catalyzed by three isoenzymes of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Mutations in each of the genes specifying the isoenzymes were isolated and mapped. aroG, the structural gene for the phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to gal, and aroH, the structural gene for the tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to aroE. aroF, the structural gene for the tyrosine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to pheA and tyrA, which specify the phenylalanine- and tyrosine-specific branch-point enzymes, respectively. The phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was the predominant DAHP synthase in wild-type cells, and only the tryosine-inhibitable isoenzyme was completely repressed, as well as inhibited, by low levels of its allosteric effector. The DAHP synthase isoenzymes were separated by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose with a phosphate gradient which contained enolpyruvate phosphate to protect the otherwise unstable phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme. No cross-inhibition of either the tyrosine- or phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was observed at inhibitor concentrations up to 1 mM. The tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme was partially purified from extracts of a strain lacking the other two isoenzymes and shown to be inhibited about 30% by 1 mM tryptophan. A preliminary study of interference by tryptophan in the periodate-thiobarbiturate assay for DAHP suggested a combined effect of tryptophan and erythrose 4-phosphate, or an aldehydic compound resulting from degradation of erythrose 4-phosphate by periodate.\n",
      "Regulation of dihydrodipicolinate synthase during growth and sporulation of Bacillus cereus. A four- to sixfold increase in specific activity of dihydrodipicolinic acid synthase was observed during sporulation of Bacillus cereus. The enzyme from cells harvested before and after the increase in specific activity appeared to be very similar as judged by pH optima, heat denaturation kinetics, apparent Michaelis constants, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose and Sephadex G-200, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Studies with various combinations of amino acids and one of the enzyme substrates, pyruvate, failed to give evidence for control of the enzyme by activation, inhibition, repression, induction, or stabilization. Omission of calcium from the sporulation medium had no significant effect on the specific activity pattern of the enzyme as a function of age of culture.\n",
      "Membrane location of a deoxyribonuclease implicated in the genetic transformation of Diplococcus pneumoniae. The cellular localization of enzymes in Diplococcus pneumoniae was examined by fractionation of spheroplasts. A deoxyribonuclease implicated in the entry of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the cell during genetic transformation was located in the cell membrane. This enzyme, the major endonuclease of the cell (endonuclease I), which is necessary for the conversion of donor DNA to single strands inside the cell and oligonucleotides outside, thus could act at the cell surface. Another enzyme, the cell wall lysin (autolysin), was also found in the membrane fraction. Other enzymes, including amylomaltase, two exonucleases, and adenosine triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease, and a restriction type endonuclease, were located in the cytosol within the cell. None of the enzymes examined were predominantly periplasmic in location. Spheroplasts were obtained spontaneously on incubation of pneumococcal cells in concentrated sugar solutions. The autolytic enzyme appears to be involved in this process. Cells that were physiologically competent to take up DNA formed osmotically sensitive spheroplasts two to three times faster than cells that were not in the competent state. Although some genetically incompetent mutants also formed spheroplasts more slowly, other such mutants formed them at the faster rate.\n",
      "D-Lactate dehydrogenase of Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. D-Lactate dehydrogenase has been purified to near homogeneity from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. As isolated, the enzyme contains flavine adenine dinucleotide and a tightly bound metal cofactor. Inactivation by ortho-phenanthroline occurs in two steps and is partially blocked by D-lactate. Reactivation by divalent metal ions occurs, with divalent zinc being the most effective. When ferricyanide is used as the electron acceptor, D-lactate has an apparent K0.5 of 3.3 M0.46; its binding is negatively cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 0.46. Replacement of ferricyanide by the other components of the electron transport system yields hyperbolic kinetics with an apparent Km for D-lactate of 26 mM. The apparent Km for ferricyanide is 2.2 X 10(-4) M. Phosphate and pyrophosphate compounds stimulate the D-lactate:ferricyanide activity. These properties suggest that interaction of this enzyme with other electron transport proteins in the chain may enhance D-lactate binding and, hence, the rate of electron transport.\n",
      "Purification, new assay, and properties of coenzyme A transferase from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. Coenzyme A (CoA) transferase from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii has been purified and crystallized, and some of its properties have been established. The work was facilitated by a newly developed coupled and continuous spectrophotometric assay in which the disappearance of added acrylate could be followed at 245 nm. The rate-limiting conversion of acetyl- and beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA to acrylyl CoA by CoA transferase was followed by the non-rate-limiting conversion to beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA by excess crotonase. Thus, a small priming quantity of acetyl CoA served to generate acrylyl CoA, which, by hydration, generated beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA. This product then served to generate more acrylyl CoA in cyclic fashion. The net result was the CoA transferase-limited conversion of acrylate to beta-hydroxypropionate. The purified transferase has a molecular weight of 125,000 and is composed of two subunits of 63,000 each, as determined by disc gel electrophoresis. Short-chain-length monocarboxylic acids are substrates, whereas dicarboxylic or beta-ketocarboxylic acids are not. The reaction kinetics are typical of a ping-pong bi bi mechanism composed of two half reactions linked by a covalent enzyme intermediate. Incubation of the transferase with acetyl CoA in the absence of a fatty acid acceptor yielded a stable intermediate which, by absorption spectrophotometry, radioactivity measurements, reduction with borohydride, reactivity with hydroxylamine, and catalytic activity, was identified as an enzyme-CoA compound. Kinetic constants for CoA transferase are: final specific activity, 110 U/mg of protein corresponding to 1.38 X 10(4) mumol of acrylate activated per mumol of transferase; Km for acrylate, 1.2 X 10(-3) M; Km for acetyl CoA (beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA), 2.4 X 10(-5) M.\n",
      "Isolation and purification of Flavobacterium alpha-1,3-glucanase-hydrolyzing, insoluble, sticky glucan of Streptococcus mutans. Studies were made on the physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides synthesized by cell-free extracts of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus sp. and their susceptibilities to dextranases. Among the polysaccharides examined, insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available dextranase preparations, and the insoluble, sticky glucan produced by S. mutans OMZ 176, which could be important in formation of dental plaques, was the most resistant. By enrichment culture of soil specimens, using OMZ 176 glucans as the sole carbon source, an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the OMZ 176 glucan. The organism was identified as a strain of Flavobacterium and named the Ek-14 bacterium. EK-14 bacterium was grown in Trypticase soy broth, and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the OMZ 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE-32) column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-32) column. The enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of pH 8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000. Its optimum pH was 6.3 and its optimal temperature was 42 C. The purified enzyme released 11% of the total glucose residues of the OMZ 176 glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of the substrate glucan. The products were found to be isomaltose, nigerose, and nigerotriose, with some oligosaccharides. The purified enzyme split the alpha-1,3-glucan endolytically and was inactive toward glucans containing alpha-1,6, alpha-1,4, beta-1,3, beta-1,4, and/or beta-1,6 bonds as the main linkages.\n",
      "Production, purification, and characterization of an extracellular chitosanase from Streptomyces. The synthesis by Streptomyces sp. no. 6 of an extracellular chitosanase was induced by glucosamine. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-100, carboxymethyl-cellulose, and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed chitosan (the beta-1,4-linked polymer of glucosamine) but not chitin nor carboxymethyl-cellulose. The only products of the hydrolysis detectable by paper chromatography were di- and triglucosamine. Sephadex G-100 chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the molecular weight of the enzyme was between 29,000 and 26,000. Acid hydrolysates of the enzyme contained no cysteic acid or glucosamine or other carbohydrate. At 25 C, maximum activity was obtained between pH 4.5 and 6.5. The enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan occurred over a wide range of temperatures and was maximal at 60 C. The rate of the reaction was inhibited by concentrations of soluble chitosan higher than 0.5 g/liter. The apparent Km calculated from a Lineweaver-Burke plot was 0.688 g/liter at pH 5.5. The enzyme prevented spore germination and caused a significant decrease in the turbidity of germinated spore suspensions of the Mucor strains tested. Such a decrease was the result of a partial lysis of the cell wall.\n",
      "Simple and sensitive procedure for screening yeast mutants that lyse at nonpermissive temperatures. After mutagenesis, surviving yeast cells are grown on plates at 25 C and later exposed to 37 C. The plates are then overlaid with a soft agar containing p-nitrophenylphosphate at pH 9.7. Lysed cells liberate alkaline phosphatase which gives rise to a yellow color on and around colonies.\n",
      "A nucleoside triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease from Bacillus laterosporus. Purification and characterization of the enzyme. A deoxyribonuclease, which requires nucleoside triphosphate for reaction, has been purified about 150-fold from extracts of Bacillus laterosporus. Potassium phosphate and ethylene glycol stabilize the purified enzyme. The enzyme degrades double-stranded DNA about 100 times faster than heat-denatured DNA in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate. Double-stranded DNA is not degraded to any measurable extent in the absence of ATP, but the enzyme exhibits activity toward denatured DNA in the absence of nucleoside triphosphate, and this activity seems to be an intrinsic property of this enzyme protein. The optimum pH is 8.5 and the maximum activity is obtained in the copresence of Mg2+ (8.0 X 10(-3)M) and Mn2+ (7.0 X 10(-5)M). ATP and dATP are most effective and nucleoside di- or monophosphates are ineffective. ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate during the reaction and the ratio of the amount of ATP cleaved to that of hydrolyzed phosphodiester bonds of DNA is about 3:1. An inhibitor of the enzyme was observed in bacterial extracts prepared by sonic disruption; the inhibitory substance is produced in the bacteria in the later stages of cell growth. Preliminary results show that the inhibitor emerged near the void volume of a Sephadex G-200 column, and was relatively heat-stable, RNase-resistant, and DNase-sensitive.\n",
      "Rapid radioimmunoassay for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate using tritiated ligand. A radioimmunoassay procedure for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CGMP) is described. The procedure is based on competitive binding between [3H]CGMP and non-radioactive CGMP, with separation of bound and unbound CGMP by Millipore filtration. The binding reaction showed very high specificity to CGMP, had a broad pH optimum, and reached equilibrium within a short time. A simple procedure for the pruification of assay samples using Dowex AG 50W-X2 resin is also described. CGMP contents in urine samples were assayed without purification. Injection of glucagon into healthy human volunteers resulted in a small but significant reduction in urinary CGMP level, whereas CAMP excretion increased dramatically.\n",
      "The effect of tryptophan administration on fatty acid synthesis in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions. 1. Tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions: fasted for 24 hr, fasted and refed with glucose or corn-oil, fasted and administered glycerol intramuscularly, and nonfasted. 2. The changes in the contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [EC 4.1.1.32] reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all groups of rats. The inversely related changes in the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate were associated with the accumulation of quinolinate in the livers. The content of quinolinate which exhibited the half-maximal effect on the contents of both metabolites was 0.1-0.2 mumole per g liver. 3. The rate of incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats. The enhancement of the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content. The hyperlipogenesis was also related to the decrease of acetyl-CoA and the increase of malonyl-CoA. The content of long-chain acyl-CoA was not affected. These effects of tryptophan administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats. The liver content of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection. The injection of glycerol into the control and the tryptophan-treated rats produced a marked increase of glycerol 3-phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either group. 4. It may be concluded that, in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions, the short-term control of fatty acid synthesis by tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase [EC 6.4.1.2] by citrate.\n",
      "Electrophoretic investigations of the acid conformational change of alpha-lactalbumin. In order to clarify how the electrophoretic behavior reflects the conformational transition of globular proteins, moving boundary electrophoresis was applied to analysis of the acid conformational change of alpha-lactalbumin. The appearance of only a single electrophoretic boundary in the transition region of the protein suggests a very rapid transition with a half-time estimated to be smaller than 7 min on the basis of the theory of isomerizing systems in electrophoresis. The transition is clearly reflected in the dependence of the mobility on the protein net charge, which shows a sigmoidal curve closely similar to that obtained by a Linderstrøm-Lang pH-tritration plot for the carboxyl groups of alpha-lactalbumin. It was also concluded from the transition curves that the acidfication does not result in complete unfolding, but that a compact structure is maintained in the acidic region with an apparently expanded form as compared to the native state of the protein. All results obtained by electrophoresis were also supported by the results of pH-jump studies, analytical gel chromatography, and CD measurements.\n",
      "Studies on cathepsins of rat liver lysosomes. II. Comparative studies on multiple forms of cathepsin A. The multiple forms of cathepsin A (AI, AII, and AIII) purified from the lysosome fraction of rat liver by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex chromatographies were studied comparatively. Forms AI, AII and AIII were stable between pH 3.0 and 5.5, and had pH optima for CBZ-Glu-Phe at 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9, respectively. These activities were rapidly lost on heating above 60 degrees. Their isoelectric points were at 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9, and the Michaelis constants for CBZ-Glu-Phe were calculated as 10, 6.6, and 4.2 X 10(-4)M, respectively. Activity was inhibited by Ag+, Au3+, Hg2+, iodine, and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), toluenesuffonyl fluoride (TSF), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were inhibitory at a concentration of 10(-3)M. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition. No distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively). In immuno-diffusion analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA, dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern. After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line. This suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces. This conclusion is supported by results obtained by poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS.\n",
      "Recombination of ciliary dynein of Tetrahymena with the outer fibers. Recombination of ciliary dyneins of Tetrahymena pyriformis with the outer fibers was investigated using turbidimetry, co-sedimentation analysis and electron microscopy. As reported by Gibbons, 30S dynein could recombine with the outer fibers, while 14S dynein did to so a lesser extent. At acidic pH, however, most of the 14S dynein was also rebound to the outer fibers. When an excess of crude dynein fraction was added to the outer fiber fraction at pH 8.2, electron microscopic observations showed that the outer doublet microtubules were decorated not only with arms but also with other electron-dense materials. On the other hand, when crude dynein fraction was mixed with the outer fibers in an appropriate quantity, only arms were reconstituted at the regular positions of A-subfibers. ATP had an inhibitory effect on the recombination of dynein with the outer fibers.\n",
      "Affinity labeling of D-amino acid oxidase with an acetylenic substrate. The acetylenic substrate, D-2-amino-4-pentynoic acid (D-propargylglycine), was oxidatively deaminated by hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase[EC 1.4.3.3], with accompanying inactivation of the enzyme. The flavin which was extracted by hot methanol from the inactivated enzyme was identical with authentic FAD by thin-layer chromatography and circular dichroism. The excitation spectrum of emission at 520 nm of the released flavin was very similar to the absorption spectrum of oxidized FAD. The released flavin was reduced by potassium borohydride. The apoenzyme prepared after propargylglycine treatment did not show restored D-amino acid oxidase activity on adding exogenous FAD. The absorption spectrum of this inactivated apoenzyme showed absorption peaks at 279 and 317 nm, and a shoulder at about 290 nm. These results strongly indicate that the inactivation reaction is a dynamic affinity labeling with D-propargylglycine which produces irreversible inactivation of the enzyme by a covalent modification of an amino acid residue at the active site.\n",
      "Studies on trypsin inhibitor in barley. I. Purification and some properties. To clarify the properties and functions of a trypsin inhibitor from Japanese barley in comparison with the inhibitor from Pirkka barley, an inhibitor was isolated from  the barley Hordeum distichum L var. emend Lamark by extraction with 1% NaCl, ammonium sulfate fractionation and repeated chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose. The final purified preparation of the inhibitor was found to be homogeneous by both chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis. The inhibitor was thermostable and was stable over the broad pH range from 2 to 11. No inhibition was observed by heavy metal ions and many reagents at 10(-2) M, except that p-chloromercuribenzoate caused a 69% loss of activity. The inhibitor was subjected to isoelectric focusing at pH 7.51 and its molecular weight was calculated to be 14,200+/-900 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The apparent dissociation constant for the complex between the inhibitor and trypsin[EC 3.4.21.4] was 1.64 X 10(-7)M with casein as a substrate. One microgram of purified inhibitor inhibited 1.5 mug of pure trypsin in the hydrolysis of alpha-N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide. By chemical modification of arginyl residues in the inhibitor with 1,2-cyclohexanedione, the inhibitor was shown to be an arginine inhibitor. The inhibitor contained relatively many basic amino acids and few half cystines as compared with Pirkka barley trypsin inhibitor.\n",
      "Metabolism of dog gastric mucosa. Nucleotide levels in parietal cells. Adenine and pyridine nucleotide levels as well as those of phosphate, phosphocreatine, lactate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, glucose, and glycogen were measured in histologically defined parietal and mucous cell sections of biopsies of dog gastric mucosa at rest, and in various secretory states. As a result of stimulation of secretion, there appeared to be no change in adenine nucleotide levels, or phosphocreatine, but there was a rise in inorganic phosphate and a fall in phosphorylation potential. However, there was a marked increase in NADH, but no change in NADPH with onset of acid secretion. The increase in the lactate to pyruvate ratio showed that the increased NADH level occurred in the cytoplasm and these data are discussed with reference to change in cell pH.\n",
      "Metal ion dependence of the binding of triiodothyronine by cytosol proteins of bullfrog tadpole tissues. The binding of triiodothyronine by Rana catesbeiana tadpole tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol was studied using dextran-coated charcoal to separate bound and free hormone. A metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact that EDTA decreased the binding of triiodothyronine 80 to 90% in tail fin and tail muscle cytosol. Inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less, 40 to 50%. This inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations with an order of potency of Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ congruent to Co2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. Other chelators, e.g. o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetate also decreased the binding of triiodothyronine, whereas citrate, oxalate, imidazole, and glycine had no effect. The triiodothyronine binding capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by EDTA treatment and dialysis against buffer. Ca2+ in the 1 to 10 mM range and Mn2+ at 1 mM could restore the binding to normal levels. Higher Mn2+ increased binding 70% above normal or to Ca2+-restored levels. The triiodothyronine cytosol binding activity was nondialyzable, heat-labile. pH-dependent, pronase-digestible, but unaffected by incubation with trypsin, RNase, and DNase, suggesting that the cytosol binding sites are acidic proteins. Scatchard analysis of triiodothyronine binding by the cytosol of different tissues, revealed Kassoc of 7.1 x 10(6) M(-1), 11.6 x 10(6) M(-1), 3.6 X 10(6) M(-1), and 68.0 x 10(6) M(-1) for tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol, respectively. The corresponding maximal binding capacities in picomoles per mg of crude cytosol protein in these four tissues were 10.4, 0.86, 1.3, and 0.04, respectively.\n",
      "The active form of cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria. Cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria exists in three forms of molecular weight: 850,000 (protein 16), of one-half (protein 8), and of one-quarter of this value (protein 4). The forms of the enzyme are named according to the number of subunits and all appear to be active in converting cholesterol to 3beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one (side chain cleavage) (Shikita, M., and Hall, P.F. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5606). To determine whether all three forms are active at their characteristic molecular weights, the three cytochromes were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 60 min; the gradients contained all the factors necessary for side chain cleavage including one of the following substrates: cholesterol, 20S-hydroxycholesterol, and 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. Regardless of the form of P-450 layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate, enzyme activity (side chain cleavage) was observed only in fractions corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of 20 to 22 S which is that for protein 16. No activity was observed at S values corresponding to either protein 8 or protein 4. These findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome P-450 from adrenocortical mitochondria is that containing 16 subunits, i.e. the form in which the cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria. Forms consisting of eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein 16 become active only by forming protein 16, at least in an aqueous medium in vitro.\n",
      "Effects of strong electrolyte upon the activity of Clostridium perfringens sialidase toward sialyllactose and sialoglycolipids. Clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography. Kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as substrates. With the latter substrate in 0.01 M Tris-acete in the absence of strong electrolyte, the pH optimum for enzymatic activity was 6.8. Addition of strong electrolyte (0.01 to 0.10 M Nac1) to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the pH optimum, Enzymatic activity at pH 5.8 rose approximately 2.5-fold; a concomitant loss of activity at pH 6.8 was also observed. The alteration of enzymatic activity caused by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in Vmax. Km remained nearly invariant. Thus, a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte concentration. Determination of the pK values of the active functional groups of C. perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pKa group of the enzyme. Strong electrolyte appeared to shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions between polyanionic sialoglycolipid micelles and the enzyme molecule, thus protecting the pKa group from inactivation. In comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon enzymatic activity toward the sialoglycolipid substrate, those observed with the monovalent substrate, sialyllacthose, were minor. Collectively, these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative substrate specificity of C. perfringens sialidase at a given pH. Furthermore, they explain the low pH optima and skewed pH profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates.\n",
      "Reconstitution of ion transport and respiratory control in vesicles formed from reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase and phospholipids. Reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex III) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure. Soybean phospholipids or mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin could be used. Oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles with cytochrome c as oxidant showed the following energy-coupling phenomena. 1. Protons were translocated outward with a coupling ratio, H+/2e, of 1.9 +/- 0.2. Measurements with mitochondria under similar conditions showed an H+/2e ratio of 1.8. Proton translocation was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net acidification of the medium from the over-all oxidation reaction. 2. Potassium ions were taken up by the reconstituted vesicles in the presence of valinomycin in a reaction coupled to electron transfer. The coupling ratio for K+ uptake, K+/2e, was 2.0 in the vesicles and approximately 1.5 in mitochondria. 3. The rate of oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated up to 10-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions. Addition of valinomycin alone in a K+ medium caused a transient stimulation of electron transfer. The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle.\n",
      "sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in particulate preparations from anaerobic, light-grown cells of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. Involvement of acyl thiolester derivatives of acyl carrier protein in the synthesis of complex lipids. Crude particulate preparations obtained from anaerobic, light-grown cells of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides have been shown to possess a significant level of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) activity. In contrast to the enzyme from Escherichia coli, the R. spheroides glycerophosphate acyltransferase has a high specificity for acyl thiolester derivatives of acyl carrier protein (ACP) as acyl donors for the reaction. Only limited , nonlinear glycerophosphate incorporation into lipid occurs when acyl coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives are employed as acyl substrate. With oleyl-ACP as substrate, maximal enzyme activity was observed at 40 degrees, over a broad pH range (6.0 to 8.5) and did not require a divalent metal cation. The presence of dithiothreitol stimulated enzyme-activity 15 to 20%. When oleyl-ACP or palmityl-ACP was employed as sole acyl group donor, the major products recoverable from the reaction mixtures were lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and monoglyceride. Althouh oleyl-ACP and palmityl-ACP gave comparable maximal velocities in the initial acylation of glycerophosphate, the formation of phosphatidic acid occurred preferentially with the unsaturated acyl-ACP derivative.\n",
      "Ion transport and respiratory control in vesicles formed from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme Q reductase and phospholipids. NADH-coenzyme Q reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex I) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure. Mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were required. Oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q1 catalyzed by the reconstituted vesicles was coupled to proton translocation, directed inward, with an H+/2e ratio greater than 1.4. Similar experiments measuring proton translocation in submitochondrial particles gave an H+/2e ratio of 1.8. The proton translocation in both systems was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net proton uptake from the reduction of coenzyme Q1 by NADH. Electron transfer in the reconstituted vesicles also caused the uptake of the permeant anion tetraphenylboron. The rate of electron transfer by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated about 3-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions. The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated NADH-coenzyme Q reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle.\n",
      "Studies on thyroid hormone-binding proteins. I. The subunit structure of human thyroxine-binding globulin and its interaction with ligands. Thyroxine-binding globulin was isolated from human plasma by ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatographic separations on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex, gel chromatography, and two different electrophoretic procedures. The highly purified was homogeneous when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation analyses, and immunochemical determinations. The weight average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugations was 54,000 and by sedimentation diffusion data 55,000. Amino acid analyses indicated a minimum of 110 amino acid residues per molecule. By determination of the minimum in the curve for the fraction of maximum deviation from the amino acid analyses it was found that the minimum molecular weight for the polypeptide was 12,200. Carbohydrate analyses demonstrated the presence f equimolar amounts of amnnose, galactose, and glucosamine, and the carbohydrate portion constituted 7.5% of the total weight. The amino acid analyses suggested that thyroxine-binding globulin is composed of 4 subunits. Molecular weight determinations by gel chromatography in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride indicated the presence of three species of globulin with apparent molecular weights 52,000, 25,000, and 13,500, respectively. Prolonged storage in guanidine hydrochloride promoted a more than 60% yield of the monomeric species. Moreover, a half-molecule of thyroxine-binding globulin was isolated and shown to consist of two polypeptide chains of similar molecular weight...\n",
      "Structural studies of two ovalbumin glycopeptides in relation to the endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase specificity. Heterogeneities of the two ovalbumin glycopeptides, (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, were revealed by borate paper electrophoresis of oligosaccharide alcohols obtained from the glycopeptides by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and NaB3H4 reduction. The structures of the major components of the oligosaccharides were determined by the combination of methylation analysis, acetolysis, and alpha-mannosidase digestion. Based on the results, the whole structures of the major components of (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn were elucidated as Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]-Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3[Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn and Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to GlcNAc leads to Asn, respectively. Since endo-beta-N-acetylglucosamini dase D hydrolyzes (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn but not (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, the presence of the unsubstituted alpha-mannosyl residue linked at the C-3 position of the terminal mannose of Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4 GlcNAcAsn core must be essential for the action of the enzyme.\n",
      "Use of 5-deazaFAD to study hydrogen transfer in the D-amino acid oxidase reaction. The apoprotein of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase was reconstituted with 5-deazaflavin adenine dinucleotide (5-deazaFAD) to yield a protein which contains 1.5 mol of 5-deazaFAD/mol of enzyme. The deazaFAD-containing enzyme forms complexes with benzoate, 2-amino benzoate, and 4-aminobenzoate which are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed with native enzyme. The complex with 2-aminobenzoate exhibits a new long wavelength absorption band characteristic of a flavin charge-transfer complex. The reconstituted enzyme exhibits no activity when assayed by D-alanine oxidation. However, the bound chromophore can be reduced by alanine, phenylalanine, proline, methionine, and valine, but not by glutamate or aspartate, indicating the deazaFAD enzyme retains the substrate specificity of the native enzyme. Reduction of the enzyme by D-alanine exhibits a 1.6-fold deuterium isotope effect. Reoxidation of the reduced enzyme occurred in the presence of pyruvate plus ammonia, but not with pyruvate alone or ammonia alone. beta-Phenylpyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate, but not alpha-ketoglutarate could replace pyruvate. Reduced enzyme isolated following reaction with [alpha-3H]alanine was found to contain 0.5 mol of tritium/mol of deazaFADH2. After denaturation of the tritium-labeled enzyme, the radioactivity was identified as deazaFADH2. Reaction of the reduced tritium-labeled enzyme with pyruvate plus ammonia prior to denaturation yields [alpha-3H]alanine and unlabeled deazaFAD. These results suggest that reduction and reoxidation of enzyme-bound deazaFAD involves the stereo-specific transfer of alpha-hydrogen from substrate to deazaFAD.\n",
      "The NSILA-s receptor in liver plasma membranes. Characterization and comparison with the insulin receptor. NSILA-s (nonsuppressible insulin-like activity, soluble in acid ethanol) is a serum peptide that has insulin-like and growth-promoting activities. We have demonstrated previously that liver plasma membranes possess separate receptors for NSILA-s and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail. In the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the NSILA-s receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same tissue. Both 125I-NSILA-s and 125I-insulin bind rapidly and reversibly to their receptors in liver membranes; maximal NSILA-s binding occurs at 20 degrees while maximal insulin binding is seen at 1-4 degrees. The pH optimum for NSILA-s binding is broad (6.0 to 8.0), in contrast to the very sharp pH optimum (7.5 to 8.0) for insulin binding. Both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity. With the insulin receptor, NSILA-s and insulin analogues compete for binding in proportion to their insulin-like potency: insulin greater than proinsulin greater than NSILA-s. With the NSILA-s receptor, NSILA-s is most potent and the order is reversed: NSILA-s greater than proinsulin greater than insulin. Furthermore, six preparations of NSILA-s which varied 70-fold in biological activity competed for 125I-NSILA-s binding in order of their potencies. NSILA-s which had been inactivated biologically by reduction and aminoethylation and growth hormone were less than 1/100,000 as potent as the most purified NSILA-s preparation. Purified preparations of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and somatomedins B and C were less than 1% as effective as NSILA-s in competing for the 125I-NSILA-s suggesting that these factors act through other receptors. In contrast, somatomedin A was 10% as active as NSILA-s and multiplication-stimulating activity was fully as active as NSILA-s in competing for the NSILA-s receptor. Analysis of the data suggests that there are approximately 50 times more insulin receptors than NSILA-s receptors per liver cell, while the apparent affinity of NSILA-s receptors is somewhat higher than that of the insulin receptor.\n",
      "Decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate by purified avian liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which has been isolated from chicken liver mitochondria in essentially homogenous form, carries out the irreversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate in the presence of catalytic amounts of GDP or IDP, as well as the reversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of substrate amounts of GTP or ITP. The pyruvate- and phosphoenolpyruvate-forming reactions are similar in their nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein. However, the two activities vary markedly in their response to added metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+ the most effective species. This reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as 2-mercaptoethanol. In contrast, the pyruvate-forming reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal ions, including Mn2+, and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents. These observations and the demonstration that pyruvate kinase-like activity is very low or absent make it unlikely that pyruvate formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate. Although the pyruvate-forming reaction is inhibited by added metal ions, the reaction is also inhibited by metal-chelating agents such as 8-hydroxyquinoline and o-phenanthroline, suggesting that the reaction is dependent on the presence of a metal ion. It has not been possible, however, to demonstrate that the enzyme is a metalloprotein.\n",
      "Patterns of fatty acid release from endogenous substrates by human platelet homogenates and membranes. We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes. The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids. Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid. With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the phospholipase A2 of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane.\n",
      "Hemoglobin Deer Lodge (beta 2 His replaced by Arg). Consequences of altering the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site. Hemoglobin Deer Lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta 2 position. X-ray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding. When stripped of anions, Hb Deer Lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below pH 6 and above pH 8. In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal and the pH dependence of oxygen binding is reduced. This contrasts with the enhanced Bohr effect seen for Hb A in the presence of organic phosphates. Due to enhanced anion binding at high pH, Hb Deer Lodge has a slightly lower oxygen affinity than Hb A at pH 9 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies at neutral pH in the absence of organic phosphates revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from Hb Deer Lodge, while approximately linear time courses were observed for Hb A. The fast phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the slow phase. The two phases are not resolvable at high pH. CO combination kinetics are much like those of Hb A except that \"fast\" and \"slow\" phases were apparent at wavelengths near the deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest that functional differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in Hb Deer Lodge. After flash photolysis of the CO derivative, the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for Hb Deer Lodge than for Hb A. This may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered, the primary differences being expressed at high pH where Hb Deer Lodge binds anions more strongly than Hb A. The properties of Hb Deer Lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.\n",
      "Oxidation of NADPH by submitochondrial particles from beef heart in complete absence of transhydrogenase activity from NADPH to NAD. Treatment of submitochondrial particles (ETP) with trypsin at 0 degrees destroyed NADPH leads to NAD (or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, AcPyAD) transhydrogenase activity. NADH oxidase activity was unaffected; NADPH oxidase and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than 10%. When ETP was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees, NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost, NADPH oxidase activity was slowly destroyed, but NADH oxidase activity remained intact. The reduction pattern by NADPH, NADPH + NAD, and NADH of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm (flavin and iron-sulfur centers) in complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) or ETP treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of transhydrogenase activity. The sensitivity of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible arginyl residues in the enzyme. Arginyl residues are considered to be positively charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes. Treatment of ETP with the specific arginine-binding reagent, butanedione, inhibited transhydrogenation from NADPH leads to NAD (or AcPyAD). It had no effect on NADH oxidation, and inhibited NADPH oxidation and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenation by only 10 to 15% even after 30 to 60 min incubation of ETP with butanedione. The inhibition of NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation was diminished considerably when butanedione was added to ETP in the presence of NAD or NADP. When both NAD and NADP were present, the butanedione effect was completely abolished, thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues at the nucleotide binding site of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase enzyme. Under conditions that transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD was completely inhibited by trypsin or butanedione, NADPH oxidation rate was larger than or equal to 220 nmol min-1 mg-1 ETP protein at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees. The above results establish that in the respiratory chain of beef-heart mitochondria NADH oxidation, NADPH oxidation, and NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation are independent reactions.\n",
      "Protein inhibitor of acid deoxyribonucleases. Improved purification procedure and properties. A method is described for the extensive purification of acid deoxyribonuclease (acid DNase) and its specific inhibitor from beef liver, the existence of which had been only supported by indirect evidence. By the use of insolubilized acid deoxyribonuclease, eight other proteins interacting with the enzyme have been detected. One of them (molecular weight, 59,000) was identified as responsible for phosphodiesterase activity which is often a contaminant of DNase preparations. Acid DNase (free of phosphodiesterase) and its inhibitor have been obtained as homogeneous proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of acid DNase and its inhibitor are, respectively, 26,500 and 21,500; those of other proteins range from 17,000 to 112,000. The properties of beef liver acid DNase are similar to those described for the enzymes extracted from other sources. The same alteration of DNase kinetics by this inhibitor, as that previously demonstrated with an impure protein has been confirmed; the sigmoidal shape observed at pH 5 for the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration progressively disappears with increasing pH. We have also demonstrated that RNA, which inhibits the acid DNase through a competitive binding to the catalytic site, is able, like the substrate, to reverse the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme.\n",
      "Nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes in Chlamydomonas flagella. Nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. ATP, originating in the cells, is utilized for motility by energy-transducing protein(s) called dynein, and the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin, and probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides, are prerequisites for the assembly of microtubules. Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases. It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia. Its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses. Two species of adenylate kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella; the latter was also present in cell bodies. A large part of flagellar nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized. Two soluble enzyme species were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies. Since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly, we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase co-polymerizes with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization. Arginine kinase was not detected in Chlamydomonas flagellar extracts.\n",
      "In vitro biosynthesis of sialosylgalactosylceramide (G7) by mouse brain microsomes. A sialytransferase activity which catalyzes the synthesis of sialosylgalactosylceramide (G7) from added galactocerebroside and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid has been demonstrated in mouse brain microsomes. The enzyme reaction shows a pH optimum of 6.3 and requires detergents. Both Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas Mg2+ had no effect. The apparent Km for galactocerebroside leading to G7 was estimated to be 8.7 X 10(-4) M. The same microsomal preparation also synthesized hematoside when ceramide lactoside was the glycolipid acceptor. The apparent Km for ceramide lactoside was about one-tenth that for galactocerebroside. When the preparations were partially inactivated by heat the synthesis of G7 and of hematoside was reduced at approximately the same rate. Liver appeared to have the highest activity for G7 synthesis (as well as of hematoside), followed by brain. The synthesis of B7 by mouse brain microsomes in vitro demonstrates a new pathway for brain ganglioside synthesis.\n",
      "Proteolytic enzymes of the K-1 strain of Streptomyces griseus obtained from a commercial preparation (Pronase). Purification and characterization of the carboxypeptidase. We described earlier the facilitated purifications of the trypsin and aminopeptidase components present in Pronase (Vosbeck, K. D., Chow, K. -F., and Awad, W. M., Jr. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6029-6034). A partially resolved protein mixture left over after one of the steps in that procedure was passed through a Sephadex G-75 column. By this means, a component with carboxypeptidase activity was separated from associated serine endopeptidases. Further purification of this exopeptidase to apparent homogeneity was acheived by refiltration through the same Sephadex column and by CM-cellulose chromatography. A single protein band was observed after acrylamide gel electrophoresis; analysis by sedimentation equilibrium using the meniscus depletion method gave a molecular weight of 30,300. This enzyme demonstrates activity against Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylglycyl-L-leucine and hippuryl-D,L-phenyllactate; no activity was found against Nalpha-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester, Nalpha-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, or L-leuckne-p-nitroanilide. The maximum activity lies between pH values of 7 and 8; the enzyme is stable between pH values of 6 and 10. At room temperature 1,10-phenanthroline inactivates the enzyme completely whereas EDTA has no effect. Of the many cations tested, only Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ restores activity to the 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme; Co2+ provided 3 times the native activity. The metal in the native protein was found to be zinc. These findings are similar to those recorded with bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, and suggest the possibility that the present enzyme may ge genetically related to the mammalian protein, as in previously noted examples of homology of three Pronase endopeptidases to pancreatic serine enzymes.\n",
      "Trypsin-sensitive photosynthetic activities in chloroplast membranes from Chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1. Location of electron transport chain components in chloroplast membranes of chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1 was investigated by use of proteolytic digestion with soluble or insolubilized trypsin. Digestion of intact membrane vesicles with soluble trypsin inactivates the water-splitting system, the 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibition site of Photosystem II, the electron transport between the two photosystems as well as the ferredoxin NADP reductase. Reduction of NADP with artificial electron donors for Photosystem I could be restored, however, by addition of purified reductase to trypsin-digested membranes. Electron transfer activities of Photosystems I and II reaction centers were resistant to trypsin digestion either from outside or from within the thylakoids when active trypsin was trapped inside the membrane vesicles by sonication and digestion carried out in the presence of trypsin inhibitor added from outside. In the latter case, the water-splitting system was also found to be resistant to digestion. Polyacrylamide-bound insolubilized trypsin inactivated only the ferredoxin NADP reductase. Photosynthetically active membranes obtained at different stages of development showed a basically similar behavior toward trypsin.\n",
      "A complex of cardiac cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c. The interactions of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac mitochondria were investigated. Cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c formed a 1:1 molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength. The complex was stable to Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned. The complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or pH exceeding 10 and only partially dissociated in 8 M urea. No complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on 64% of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its 2 methionine residues. Complexes with molecular ratios of less than 1:1 (i.e. more cytochrome c) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c, or cytochrome c with all lysine residues guanidinated, or a \"1-65 heme peptide\" from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used. These results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes. The reduced complex was autooxidizable with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 X 10(-5) and 5 X U0(-5) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide. The complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32% and 40% respectively, of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone. The complex was less photoreducible than cytochrome c1 alone. The complex exhibited remarkably different circular dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c. We concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices. All results available would indicate that in the complex cytochrome c1 was bound at the entrance to the heme crevice of cytochrome c on the methionine-80 side of the heme crevice.\n",
      "Leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens). Effect of pH on the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ to and on activation of the enzyme. Incubation of leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) with various concentrations of Mg2+ at various pH values in 1 M KCl and 0.155 M trimethylamine-HCl at 37 degrees confirms that Mg2+ competes with Zn2+ for binding only 1 site per 54,000-dalton subunit. The ratio of the apparent association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) at this site (site 1) was estimated to be 20,720 at pH 8.16, 10,570 at pH 8.44, 3,590 at pH 8.78, and 660 AT PH 9.14. The decrease in values of 1KZn/Mg with increasing pH in the activation of leucine aminopeptidase by Mg2+ is attributed to the lowering of the free Zn2+ concentration relative to that of free Mg2+ caused by the formation of ZnOH+ and Zn(OH)2 complexes with increasing OH- concentration. When corrections are made for the binding of Zn2+ by OH- ions, the pH-independent ratio of association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) for the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ at site 1 of leucine aminopeptidase in 29,800. From the effect of pH on the relative binding constant, a value (beta2) for the product of the two stepwise association constants for the formation of Zn(OH)2 from Zn2+ and OH- (Zn2+ + OH- in equilibrium ZnOH+; ZnOH+ + OH- in equilibrium Zn(OH)2) was estimated to be 4.42 X 10(10) M-2 at 37 degrees. Values of Km at pH 7.5 AND 30 degrees with L-leucine p-nitroanilide as substrate in the presence of 0.01 M NaHCO3 are 4.13 and 2.01 mM for the zinc-zinc and magnesium-zinc enzymes, respectively. Values for Vmax are 0.2 and 2.49 mumol/min/mg, respectively.\n",
      "Biochemical studies of tast sensation. Binding of L-[3H]alanine to a sedimentable fraction from catfish barbel epithelium. Large numbers of taste buds are distributed over the body surface of the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus, with the barbels having an especially high density. L-Alanine, as well as certain other amino acids, are taste stimuli in this animal. Epithelial tissue obtained by gentle scraping of the barbel surface was fractionated by differential centrifugation. A sedimentable fraction (P2) was prepared that was enriched in L[OH]alanine binding activity, the plasma membrane marker enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, and the mitochondrial marker succinate cytochrome c reductase, but not the microsomal marker NADH cytochrome c redu.ctase. Binding of L-[OH]alanine was measured using a Millipore filter method in which correction for non-specific binding was also determined. Time, temperature, and pH for measuring binding activity were established. At the optimal pH of 7.8, the KD for L-alanine is 4.8 X 10(-6) M. The first order dissociation rate constant at 6 degrees is 3.8 X 10(-4) s-1 and at 24 degrees it is 12.1 X 10(-4) s-1. The second order rate constant for association is between 10(2) and 10(3) M-1 S-1. Reversibility of the binding interaction was also demonstrates by the rapid displacement of bound L-[3H]alanine by a large excess of unlabeled L-alanine. That the binding does not represent incorporation into protein was confirmed by the lack of effect of puromycin. The amounts bound of several other chemostimulatory amino acids werealso determined.\n",
      "Arterialization of the coronary veins in diffuse coronary arteriosclerosis. Since the coronary veins and capillaries are not involved with arteriosclerotic disease the authors performed experimental, and afterwards, clinical total and selective coronary vein arterialization. Acute myocardial ischaemia created for instance by ligation of the anterior descending branch, was treated by an internal mammary artery to regional coronary vein anastomosis. In 21 patients the selective arterialization of the \"Vena cordis magna\" or of \"Vena cordis media\", and total arterialization of the coronary sinus was performed. The clinical improvement and follow-up studies seem to be promising in the treatment of patients with advanced diffuse heavy coronary arteriosclerosis. In acute myocardial ischaemia with coronarographically localized coronary occlusion, the aim of regional vein arterialization is to minimize the area of infarction.\n",
      "Structure, composition, physical properties, and turnover of proliferated peroxisomes. A study of the trophic effects of Su-13437 on rat liver. Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437). DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins. The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic effect of the drug used. In males, Su-13437 is more active than CPIB, another peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females, only Su-13437 is active.\n",
      "Localization of NADH oxidase on the surface of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes by a new cytochemical method. The ultrastructural localization of NADH oxidase, a possible enzyme in the increased oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during phagocytosis, was studied. A new cytochemical technique for the localization of H2O2, a product of NADH oxidase activity, was developed. Cerous ions, in the presence of peroxide, form an electron-dense precipitate. Resting and phagocytically stimulated PMN were exposed to cerous ions at pH 7.5 to demonstrate sites of NADH-dependent, cyanide-insensitive H2O2 production. Resting PMN exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane; phagocytizing PMN had extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the phagosome and on the plasma membrane. Peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of catalase on cerium precipitation; the surface localization of the enzyme responsible was confirmed by using nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzymatic activity. A correlative study was performed with an NADH-dependent, tetrazolium-reduction system. As with cerium, formazan deposition on the surface of the cell was NADH dependent, cyanide insensitive, and stimulated by phagocytosis. Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit tetrazolium reduction, as observed cytochemically, indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without superoxide interposition. These findings, combined with oxygen consumption studies on resting and stimulated PMN in the presence or absence of NADH, indicate that NADH oxidase is a surface enzyme in human PMN. It is internalized during phagocytosis and retains its peroxide-generating capacity within the phagocytic vacuole.\n",
      "Defective lysosomal enzyme secretion in kidneys of Chediak-Higashi (beige) mice. The beige mouse is an animal model for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types. In mice, treatment with androgenic hormones causes a 20-50-fold elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. Beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (hexosaminidase) levels than normal mice. Other androgen-inducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice. No significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment, nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen. Histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidase-containing lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary. In normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine. Levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice. It appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper fusion with the plasma membrane. A similar defect could account for characteristics of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\n",
      "Stimulation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport in control and virus-transformed cells by ethidium bromide. Recently we demonstrated that ethidium bromide altered the plasma and subcellular membrane glycoproteins in control and virus transformed cells. It is reported here that ethidium bromide also stimulated the membrane associated process of sugar transport. The KM of the virus transformed cells and the ethidium bromide treated cells is the same as that of the control cells while the maximum velocity as compared to the control cells is significantly increased. The transport of 2-deoxyl-D-glucose was inhibited by glucose, cytochalasin B and neuraminidase but was unaffected by variations in cell density or pH of the incubation medium.\n",
      "Effect of pharmacological agents on human keratinocyte mitosis in vitro. II. Inhibition by catecholamines. Catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human keratinocytes probably via a block in the G2 part of the cell cycle. Epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X 10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol. These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex.\n",
      "Serum-free growth of HTC cells containing glucocorticoid- and insulin-inducible tyrosine aminotransferase and cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors. HTC cells have been made to grow in chemically defined medium without any macromolecular supplements whatsoever. Initial estimates of their relative amino acid requirements have been made. The cells grown in the defined medium retain many of the differentiated features which have been the focus of investigation in their serum-grown counterparts. Thus, the cells in defined medium contain cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and have tyrosine aminotransferase which can be induced by glucocorticoids, serum or insulin. These cells also produce, in small amounts, an as yet undefined rat serum protein.\n",
      "Stimulation of lactic acid production in chick embryo fibroblasts by serum and high pH in the absence of external glucose. Lactic acid production by chick embryo fibroblasts occurs in the absence of exogenous glucose. Fifteen to 50-fold less lactic acid is formed in the absence of glucose than in its presence. Nevertheless, serum and pH stimulation enhances this residual lactic acid production to the same relative extent as when glucose is present. The amount of lactic acid formed cannot be accounted for by the catabolism of residual glucose in the medium since its concentration is less than one-tenth that of the lactic acid eventually produced. Moreover, the residual glucose concentration remains constant or increases during the course of the experiment. To a large extent lactic acid accumulation in the absence of external glucose is dependent on the presence of amino acids in the medium, but amino acid transport is not affected by the stimulatory agents used in this study. The results suggest that treatments which stimulate cell multiplication also activate those enzymatic pathways which convert amino acids to pyruvic and thence to lactic acid.\n",
      "Isolation and studies of the granules of the amebocytes of Limulus polyphemus, the horseshoe crab. Granules were isolated from the cytoplasm of the amebocytes of Limulus polyphemus, the horseshoe crab, by disruption of cells obtained from blood which had been drawn into 2 mM propranolol. The granules subsequently were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient that contained heparin. Extracts of the granules were prepared by freezing and thawing the granule preparations in distilled water. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of the granules revealed round or ovoid particles. However, only one type of granule appeared to be present. The ultraviolet spectrum of the extract of amebocyte granules demonstrated a peak at 277 nm at pH 7.4, and a shift into two peaks of 281 nm and 290 nm at alkaline pH. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a pattern similar to that observed with lysates prepared from intact amebocytes. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in the presence of urea at pH 4.5, demonstrated patterns similar to those observed with amebocyte lysate. Extracts of the granules were gelled by bacterial endotoxin. The blood of the horseshoe crab contains only one type of cell, the amebocyte. Previous studies have shown that the blood coagulation mechanism of Limulus is contained entirely within amebocytes. The current studies suggest that the granules, which pack the cytoplasm of these cells, contain all of the factors required for the coagulation of blood, including the clottable protein. The intracellularly localized coagulation system is released from amebocytes when their granules rupture during cell aggregation.\n",
      "Purification of human red cell glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase by affinity chromatography. Human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with NADPH was efficiently bound with agarose-bound NADP, whereas the enzyme associated with NADP was poorly bound with agarose-bound NADP. After the elimination of haemoglobin from haemolyzate by treatment with DEAE-cellulose, the enzyme was converted into the NADPH-bound form and was applied on an affinity column. The enzyme was specifically eluted from the column by NADP in the elution buffer. A homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained in high yield.\n",
      "Simultaneous determination of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol in plasma by mass fragmentography. A quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of propranolol and its active metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol in human plasma is described. Plasma samples are extracted at pH 9.6 with ethyl acetate after the addition of sodium bisulphite and the internal standard oxprenolol. The extracts are derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride before separation on a gas chromatograph--mass spectrometer. Detection and quantitation of the trifluoroacetyl derivatives are made by single-ion monitoring. The minimum detectable concentration of propranolol is 1 ng/ml and of 4-hydroxypropranolol 5 ng/ml using 1-ml plasma samples. No interferences from normal plasma constituents or from drugs commonly prescribed together with propranolol were detected.\n",

The separation of amino acids has been achieved on a short column of Chromo-Beads C2 resin, with a lithium gradient-elution system. The analysis took 8 h. The separation of asparagine and glutamine from glutamic acid was highly dependent on the sample pH and on the methanol concentration in the first buffer of the gradient. The method has been applied to analysis of human plasma and granulocytes for amino acids.\n",
      "Determination of 3-(5-tetrazolyl) thioxanthone 10,10-dioxide in human plasma, urine and faeces. A gas chromatographic method is described for assay of 3-(5-tetrazolyl) thioxanthone 10,10-dioxide (BW 59C) in human plasma, urine and faeces. After extraction into 1,2-dichloroethane from alkaline medium the compound is converted to the heptafluorobutyrate derivative which is injected into a gas chromatograph and measured using a 63Ni electron capture detector. The assay produces a linear calibration curve over the range 0-30 mug/ml when the internal standard method is used. Reproducibility is good and sensitivity down to 1 ng injected on column is possible. The method has been used to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of BW 59C in man and has been semi-automated by the use of an autosampler and dedicated computer.\n",
      "Methods to improve detection of pneumococci in respiratory secretions. Simple methods to enhance the detection of pneumococci in respiratory secretions are needed. Sheep blood agar containing 5 mug of gentamicin per ml was more often positive (89%) than either standard sheep blood agar (54%) or mouse inoculation (65%) in recovering pneumococci from 62 adult and pediatric patients. In adults, the direct quellung test on sputum smear was a rapid, sensitive method for predicting subsequent pneumococcal isolation by culture (19 of 20 patients, 95%). The quellung test and gentamicin plate show improved sensitivity over current techniques for pneumococcal detection and can be recommended for general use.\n",
      "Dependence on dose of the acute effects of ethanol on liver metabolism in vivo. The dose dependence of the acute effects of ethanol upon liver intermediary metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in rats. Ethanol was given i.p. in doses of 0.69, 1.7, and 3.0 g/kg in equal volumes (20 ml/kg). The liver was freeze-clamped 120 min after injection, and multiple metabolites were measured in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue. Each group showed a significantly different pattern of metabolites, redox states, and phosphorylation potentials although the rate of ethanol disappearance, at least between the two highest dose groups, was not significantly different. The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios and the cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio were paradoxically most reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized with increasing dose. Once established, the differences in these ratios between the groups tended to persist with time, relatively independent of the concentration of ethanol. In a somewhat different pattern, the phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1]) remained at the control level in the low-dose group but was significantly elevated in the two higher-dose groups. The results, therefore, show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to NADH production.\n",
      "Factors affecting the solubility of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals. The solubility of triclinic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals was measured under varying conditions using 45Ca-labeled crystals, expressing solubility as micromoles per liter of 45Ca in solution. In a 0.1-M Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.4, the solubility of accurately sized CPPD crystals (37-20mum) was 60muM with maximal solubility being attained after about 8 h incubation at 37degreeC. Reduction in crystal size, decrease in pH, increase in ionic strength, Mg++, citrate, and albumin all increased solubility. The most marked effects on solubility occurred when changing the calcium concentration or by enzymatic hydrolysis of inoganic pyrophosphate to orthophosphate. It was found that decreasing the ionized calcium level below 5 mg/100 ml resulted in a progressive enhancement of solubility. The observed solubility-enhancing effects of albumin could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby, altered ionized calcium level. Diffusible calcium in synovial fluid was only 40% of the total calcium concentration, which means most joint fluids are normally near the critical concentration of 5 mg/100 ml of ionized calcium, below which solubility is enhanced. During surgery, especially parathyroidectomy, calcium levels fall, favoring dissolution of CPPD crystals. We speculate that the slight decrease in crystal size during dissolution frees them from their cartilaginous mold, resulting in a dose-dependent inflammatory reaction as they are \"shed\" into the joint space. Crystal shedding may be reinforced by the modest fall in joint fluid pH accompanying the inflammatory response.\n",
      "Evidence from rats that morphine tolerance is a learned response. It is proposed that the direct analgesic effect of morphine becomes attenuated over the course of successive administrations of the narcotic by a conditioned, compensatory, hyperalgesic response elicited by the administration procedure, the net result being analgesic tolerance. Using the \"hot plate\" analgesia assessment situation with rats, this conditioning view of tolerance is supported by several findings: (a) It is necessary to have reliable environmental cues predicting the systemic effects of morphine if tolerance is to be observed, (b) a hyperalgesic conditioned response may be observed in morphine-tolerant subjects when drug administration cues are followed by a placebo, and (c) merely by repeatedly presenting environmental cues previously associated with morphine (but now presented with a placebo), morphine tolerance can be extinguished.\n",
      "Murexide for determination of free and protein-bound calcium in model systems. The determination with murexide of free and protein-bound calcium in model systems of known composition, ionic strength, and pH was investigated. The spectra of calcium murexide in the presence of varying amounts of calcium ions indicated that the absorption maximum fo calcium murexide complex occurs at 480 nm while that of murexide ion is at 520 nm. The absorbance at 509 nm is independent of calcium ion concentration and, therefore, could be used to measure the total dye. The spectra are pH dependent but constant in the range 6.5 to 7.0. The apparent dissociation constant of calcium murexide is dependent upon ionic environment, ionic strength, and free calcium ion concentration. The relationship between the apparent dissociation constant and free calcium concentration was established. Whole casein had no effect on the absorption spectra of calcium murexide and no affinity for calcium murexide complex or murexide ion. Beta-casein, at the concentrations employed, did not influence the dissociation fo calcium murexide. At pH 7.0, ionic strength .1, and 2 C, Beta-casein bound calcium as if there were 8.65 binding sites per molecule, each of pK 2.23, corresponding to an intrinsic association constant of 168.9 liters per mole.\n",
      "Lorazepam compared with pentobarbital for nighttime sedation. Lorazepam (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg) was compared with pentobarbital (60 and 180 mg) for its effect on sleep in \"hospital insomnia.\" Subjective-response data were collected by research nurses. Lorazepam was found to be a potent nighttime sedative: 1 to 1.25 mg of lorazepam is equivalent to 100 mg sodium pentobarbital for measures of sleep quality and duration. At this dose level it is less effective than 100 mg of pentobarbital as a sleep inducer. Studies at higher doses (up to 4 mg) indicate that lorazepam has a wide therapeutic index.\n",
      "Effect of trace elements on dissolution of hydroxyapatite by cariogenic streptococci. The effect of low levels of strontium, boron, lithium, molybdenum, and fluorine, alone and in combination, on hydroxyapatite solubility, bacterial growth, and acid production in five antigenic types of Streptococcus mutans was investigated. Pour plates containing synthetic hydroxyapatite were used to compare dissolution of hydroxyapatite. The colonies of the five antigenic types of S mutans produced zones of dissolution that were measured. Acid production and growth were studied in broth culture media. The results show that low levels of strontium and fluorine can significantly reduce demineralization of synthetic hydroxyapatite by S mutans in vitro.\n",

      "Peroxisome development in the metanephric kidney of mouse. The relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle number during differentiation of the metanephric kidney in the mouse was approached from several experimental directions. Biochemical analyses of marker enzymes for peroxisomes (catalase and D-amino acid oxidase), mitochondria (cytochrome oxidase) and lysosomes (acid phosphatase) were performed on kidneys at ages from 17 days prenatal to adult. These data were correlated with a morphometric analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in differentiating cells of the proximal tubule. Postnatal development of the metanephric kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per 100 mu2 in the proximal tubule during the first 4 weeks of postnatal growth. Elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments of ER were often in close apposition. Extensive interactions between segments of ER and peroxisomes were readily visible in 0.5-mu sections viewed in the high voltage electron microscope. In contrast to peroxisomes, neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase, suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in the proximal tubule at birth, prior to complete development of the kidney.\n",
      "Inhibitory effects of antihistamines and antiserotonins on the bone marrow reactions produced by Escherichia coli endotoxin in mice. The bone marrow reactions (that is, decrease of nucleated cell counts and increase of red blood cell counts) of mouse bone were observed 1 hr after injection of endotoxin and peaked after 18 hr. These reactions were significantly inhibited when diphenhydramine, promethazine (antihistamines), chlorpromazine (antiserotonin), or cyproheptadine (antihistamine and antiserotonin) was given 30 min before endotoxin. Such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin and peaked 1 hr after administration. The histamine-induced changes were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine. These reactions were also produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin, whereas no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine or serotonin. These results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow reactions, which then continue in the presence of further mediators. Antihistamines and antiserotonins are considered to hinder the whole process of reactions produced by endotoxin.\n",
      "On the interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate, and the importance of bile salts. The interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of lipase and colipase activities. The results suggest that lipase binds to hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation. Bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a pH of about 6.5 displace lipase from this binding, resulting in a reversible in activation. At pH values below about 6.5, lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt, and a low activity peak is seen around pH 5.5. This is the result of the binding of lipase to the \"supersubstrate\" and the activity of the catalytic site. In the presence of bile salt, colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the \"supersubstrate\" but not to other hydrophobic interfaces, and catalytic activity is reestablished. Kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship.\n",
      "Effect of ionic strength and ionic composition of assay buffers on the interaction of thyroxine with plasma proteins. When plasma proteins are diluted with buffer the ionic strength and ionic composition of that buffer affects the interactions between thyroxine (T4) and its plasma protein-binding sites. Increases in phosphate, chloride or barbiturate ion concentration from 50 to 200 mmol/l caused a significant decrease in the affinity of plasma proteins for T4, and a concurrent increase in the concentration of unbound T4. These results cannot be completely accounted for by changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions caused quantitatively different effects on unbound T4 concentration. The degree of depression of T4 binding by the three anions studied was in the order barbiturate greater than chloride greater than phosphate. The results of a systematic study on the composition of diluent buffer systems indicated that when a 50 mM-sodium phosphate-100 mM-NaCl buffer (pH 7-4) was used as a plasma diluent, there were unlikely to be gross changes in the T4-binding properties of plasma proteins with dilution.\n",
      "The innervation of the salivary gland of the moth, Manduca sexta: evidence that dopamine is the transmitter. 1. Using the Falck-Hillarp histochemical technique for monoamines, evidence was found for the presence of a catecholamine in the salivary gland nerves of the moth, Manduca sexta. 2. The innervation was studied with the electron microscope. Only the fluid-secreting region of the gland is innervated and the nerve endings are characteristic of monoamine-containing terminals. 3. Using a sensitive enzymatic-isotopic assay for catecholamines, it was found that whole salivary glands contain 0.33 mug/g dopamine but no noradrenaline. 4. It seems likely that dopamine mediates fluid-secretion in the salivary gland of Manduca as it does a number of other arthropods.\n",
      "An electrophysiological analysis of chemoreception in the sea anemone Tealia felina. 1. Electrophysiological techniques have been employed to examine the nature of the response observed in the ectodermal slow-conduction system (SSI) when dissolved food substances contact the column of Tealia felina. The response seems to consist entirely of sensory activity which may continue for periods of many minutes, provided that the stimulatory chemicals remain contacting the column. 2. The interval between each evoked pulse gradually increases as the sensory response progresses. This does not result from fatigue in the conduction system but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation. This may occur over a period of several minutes, which is much longer than comparable adaptation in higher animals. 3. Physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the pedal disc, oral disc, tentacles and pharynx. 4. The basic role of the SSI in coordinating behavioural activity in sea anemones is reviewed. It is concluded that it functions primarily as a single, diffuse-conducting unit responsible for transmitting frequency-coded sensory information from ectodermal chemoreceptors to ectodermal (and perhaps endodermal) effectors.\n",
      "The selective eosinophil chemotactic activity of histamine. Histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from mixed granulocyte populations when over 20% eosinophils were used in a modified Boyden chamber chemotactic assay system. This effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase (histaminase) and was generated by decarboxylation of L-histidine. A linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between 3 X 10(-7) M and 1.25 X 10(-6) M, while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils. The attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by H-1 or H-2 receptor antagonists, however, the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by metiamine, an H-2 receptor antagonist. The effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays: (a) counting cells that had traversed 5-mum pore, 12-mum thick polycarbonate filters, (b) counting cells that had migrated various distances into a 3-mum pore, 145-mum cellulose nitrate filters, or (c) measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using 15Cr-labeled cells. The ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient; histamine did not cause a dose-dependent increase in random motility. Furthermore, preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by C5a. It is concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils, while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration. These observations may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.\n",
      "Hemoglobins and hemocyanins: comparative aspects of structure and function. Comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by themselves, and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an animal's physiology. In the case of fish hemoglobins, some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems. It appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in general. The trout hemoglobin system is an example. Distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligand-binding mechanism. Characterization of the multiple, structurally distinct subunits of the 60S Limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in understanding its function. Our studies suggest the possibility of using Limulus hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays. The rapid development of molecular structural data from X-ray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science.\n",
      "How do biological systems discriminate among physically similar ions? This paper reviews the history of understanding how biological systems can discriminate so strikingly among physically similar ions, especially alkali cations. Appreciation of qualitative regularities (\"permitted sequences\") and quantitative regularities (\"selectivity isotherms\") in ion selectivity grew first from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes, then of biological systems such as enzymes and cell membranes, and most recently of lipid bilayers doped with model pores and carriers. Discrimination of ions depends on both electrostatic and steric forces. \"Black-box\" studies on intact biological membranes have in some cases yielded molecular clues to the structure of the actual biological pores and carriers. Major current problems involve the extraction of these molecules; how to do it, what to do when it is achieved, and how (and if) it is relevant to the central problems of membrane function. Further advances are expected soon from studies of rate barriers within membranes, of voltage-dependent (\"excitable\") conducting channels, and of increasingly complex model systems and biological membranes.\n",
      "Photoreceptor processes: some problems and perspectives. Visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment (rhodopsin). Visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar: the chromophore is 11-cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage (Schiff base) to a membrane protein, opsin. The effect of light is to isomerize the chromophore to the all-trans configuration. Beyond these fundamental similarities, several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear. (1) Light causes vertebrate visual pigments to bleach, liberating the chromophore. Most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light, but instead form a thermally stable metarhodopsin, with the chromophore in the all-trans configuration still attached to the opsin. (2) In the disk membranes of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments, the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks. Within this plane, however, both rotational and translational diffusion are possible. In the microvillar membranes of arthropod and cephalopod rhabdoms, on the other hand, the situation is less clear. There is evidence for some preferential orientation of chromophores that implies restrictions on Brownian rotation. (3) In the outer segments of vertebrate receptors, absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the plasma membrane to hyperpolarize due to a decrease in sodium conductance, possibly mediated by calcium ions. In most invertebrate photoreceptors, light causes a depolarization due to an increase in conductance, principally to sodium ions. A subsequent entry of calcium causes a partial repolarization of the membrane, due to a decrease in sodium conductance. (4) For vertebrate receptors, log threshold is directly proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached (Dowling-Rushton relationship). The proportionality constant varies in different preparations from less than four to more than 30, and the physical basis for the relationship is unknown. For invertebrates, by contrast, the dependence of sensitivity on rhodopsin concentration is much less dramatic and may well depend simply on the probability of quantum catch. (5) In most species, vertebrate and invertebrate, the accumulation of photoproduct probably has no effect on membrane conductance, but several possible exceptions exist. (6) Photoregeneration of rhodopsin from metarhodopsin is likely an important mechanism of recovery in certain arthropods such as diurnal insects, but dark mechanisms of recovery also exist in all phyla. In no single case are they adequately understood.\n",
      "Hydrolysis of the hen egg vitelline membrane by cock sperm acrosin and other enzymes. A technique utilizing Pregnant Mare's Serum Gonadotropin and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin treatment of hens (Gallus domesticus), followed by manual ovulation of the excised follicles, was developed to obtain a large number of mature ova. The intact ova were used to test whether acrosin, partially purified from the spermatozoa of the cock (Gallus domesticus), partially purified rabbit testicular acrosin and commercial preparations of several hydrolytic enzymes could dissolve the inner vitelline membrane. Enzymes were applied to pieces of filter paper placed on the ovum. Cock acrosin and endopeptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, collagenase and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas exopeptidases such as leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase A did not. Phospholipase A, sulfatase, hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and rabbit testicular acrosin also failed to hydrolyze the membrane. Cock acrosin hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor. The surface of the ovum over the germinal disc region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock acrosin than the surface over other regions of the ovum. Acrosin from cock sperm caused the release of trichloroacetic acid soluble material absorbing at 280 nm from sonicated preparations of inner vitelline membranes. Hydrolysis was greatest at pH 8.0 and was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.\n",
      "Some effects of low pH on chloride exchange in human red blood cells. In order to test the range of pH values over which the titratable carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid, chloride self-exchange across human red blood cells was examined between pH 4.75 and 5.7 at 0 decrees c. It was found that chloride self-exchange flux had a minimum near pH 5 and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity. The Arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low pH values. The chloride flux at pH 5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher pH values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared. In addition, the extent of inhibition of chloride self-exchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low pH. Our interpretation of these findings is that the carrier-mediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower pH values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below pH5. A possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell membranes as dimers of HCl at these very low pH values.\n",
      "Ionic properties of the acetylcholine receptor in cultured rat myotubes. The acetylcholine reversal potential (Er) of cultured rat myotubes is -3mV. When activated, the receptor is permeable to K+ and Na+, but not to Cl- ions. Measurement of Er in Tris+-substituted, Na-free medium also indicated a permeability to Tris+ ions. Unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of Er was insensitive to change in external Ca++ (up to 30 mM) or to changes in external pH (between 6.4 and 8.9). The equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries (EK and ENa) and their respective conductances (gK and gNa), which has been generally useful in describing the Er of adult rat and frog muscle, could also be applied to rat myotubes when Er was measured over a wide range of external Na+ concentrations. The equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media of different external K+ concentrations. In this case, the Er was more closely described by the Goldman constant field equation. Under certain circumstances, it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the Goldman equation. Attempts to similarly manipulate the responses of cultured rat myotubes were unsussessful. These trials included a reduction in temperature (15 degress C), partial alpha-bungarotoxin blodkade, and activation of responses with the cholinergic agonist, decamethonium.\n",
      "Effect of cross-reinnervation on physiological parameters and on properties of myosin and sarcoplasmic reticulum of fast and slow muscles of the rabbit. Cross-reinnvervation of fast (extensor digitorum longus) and slow (soleus) twitch muscles of the rabbit showed essentially complete fast to slow and slow to fast conversion, respectively, 11-12 mo after surgery with respect to a number of physiological parameters including intrinsic shortening, velocity, and isometric twitch time to peak. There was pronounced bu incomplete biochemical conversion as judged by Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum, myosin ATPase, alkali lability, and light chain complement. The question of trophic substances of neural origin is discussed in light of the fact that chronic stimulation for 15 wk of a fast muscle produces complete biochemical and physiological conversion to the slow type.\n",
      "Chitin synthase in Mortierella vinacea: properties, cellular location and synthesis in growing cultures. Chitin synthase of Mortierella vinacea was present in the \"microsomal' fraction (100 000 g precipitate), the 'cell-wall' fraction (2000 g precipitate) and the 'mitochondrial' fraction (10 000 g precipitate). The properties of the 'microsomal' enzyme were investigated. The pH optimum was between 5-8 and 6-2, and the temperature optimum was between 31 and 33 degrees C. The Km for UDP N-acetyl-D-glucosamine was 1.8 mM. The enzyme was stimulated by Mg2+ and a slight stimulation was also effected by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Soluble chitodextrins were inhibitory. A pH-dependent, heat-stable inhibitor of chitin synthase activity was present in the soluble cytoplasm from the mycelium. The effects of aeration and glucose concentration on enzyme production in growing cultures were also investigated; maximum specific activity of chitin synthase was associated with the cessation of exponential growth.\n",
      "Protoplasts of Schizosaccharomyces pombe: an improved method for their preparation and the study of their guanine uptake. A new method is described for the efficient conversion of Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells into protoplasts. The following parameters of guanine uptake determined in whole cells were unchanged in protoplasts: Km value, requirement for an energy source, sensitivity to competitive inhibitors, pH optimum, as well as the typical variation of the initial velocity of uptake observed during the growth phase.\n",
      "Manganese mutagenesis in yeast. A practical application of manganese for the induction of mitochondrial antibiotic-resistant mutations. When yeast cells were incubated for 4 to 8 h in yeast extract-peptone-glucose medium, pH 6, containing 8 mM-manganese, and then plated on selective media, there was a strong induction of antibiotic-resistant mutations. Indirect evidence suggests that practically all resistant mutants selected were of independent origin. The analysis of manganese-induced resistant mutants showed that most were extranuclear, while those tested showed recombination with known mitochondrial markers. Our results suggest that manganese can be considered as a mutagen which specifically induces mitochondrial mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n",
      "The properties and large-scale production of L-asparaginase from citrobacter. An intracellular L-asparaginase with antitumour activity was purified from a strain of Citrobacter. The optimum conditions for enzyme production by fermentation on scales up to 2700 l were investigated. Highest enzyme yield was obtained in corn-steep liquor medium (9-2%, W/V) at 37 degrees C. Oxygen limitation was not necessary for high enzyme yield. A total recovery of 4-3% from nucleic-acid-free extract and a 180-fold increase in specific activity were obtained after purificaiton. The specific activity of the purified preparation was 45 i.u./mg protein. The enzyme hydrolysed D-asparagine and L-glutamine at 7 and 5%, respectively, of its activity toward L-asparagine, but L-glutaminase activity could be demonstrated only at substrate concentrations above 5 mM. The Km values for L-asparagine and D-asparagine were 2-6 X 10(-5) and 1-4 X 10(-4) respectively. The anti-lymphoma activity of the enzyme was demonstrated with Gardner lymphosarcoma and was found only slightly less potent that Crasnitin, the most active asparaginase so far tested in this system.\n",
      "Effect of inorganic phosphate on acridine inhibition and plasmid curing in Escherichia coli. Some mutants and stock strains of Escherichia coli K12 were sensitive to acriflavine in the presence of inorganic phosphate but were resistant to acriflavine in its absence. They mutated spontaneously to resistance to acriflavine plus phosphate. The synergistic effect of phosphate on acriflavine sensitivity was increased at high pH values. Genetic analysis suggested that the mutations occurred in the gene acrA. Electron microscopic observation suggested that the presence of acriflavine plus phosphate affected the structure of the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm under it. This structural alteration was not caused by acriflavine alone. Acridine orange plus phosphate can more effectively eliminate the plasmid F8-gal+ than acridine orange alone.\n",
      "Oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane by Pseudomonas methanica. The oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane by suspensions and ultrasonic extracts of Pseudomonas methanica was studied. A continuous assay for the oxidation of CO to CO2 was devised, using O2 and CO2 electrodes in combination. Stoicheiometries of CO-dependent CO2 formation, O2 consumption and NADH oxidation, and the partial stoicheiometries of methane-dependent NADH oxidation, suggest the involvement of a mono-oxygenase in these oxidations. Evidence is presented suggesting methane and CO oxidation are catalysed by a single enzyme system, distinct, at least in part, from the NADH oxidase present in extracts. Ethanol was able to provide the reductant necessary for CO oxidation by cell suspensions, though the metabolism of ethanol by P. methanica was found unlikely to result in substrate-level formation of NADH; the means whereby alcohol oxidation could supply reductant for the mono-oxygenase are discussed.\n",
      "Systematic desensitization to reduce dream-induced anxiety. A modified version of systematic desensitization was used to reduce the anxiety and negative interpersonal consequences produced by a recurrent aversive dream resulting from events in the real world. The subject, a 16-year-old incarcerated male, was first taught a standard relaxation technique. The subject's dream was divided into 12 hierarchical imaginal scenes. Following initial relaxation, each scene was sequentially introduced and followed by the therapist's suggestion that the subject was still very relaxed. After three sessions with the therapists and several practice sessions by himself, the subject reported no further anxiety to the dream (which continued to occur) and improved relations with the institutional staff. Six months of follow-up showed no recurrence of the anxiety or the subsequent irritability which the subject had initially reported as leading to negative interpersonal relations with the staff.\n",
      "Experimental evaluation of the spasmogenicity of dopamine on the basilar artery. Arteriograms of the basilar artery reveal that dopamine given intracisternally to dogs can generate cerebral vasospasm. This finding supports a recent hypothesis of others that dopamine may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm, especially since many substances are known which fail to produce such spasm. Compared to blood or prostaglandin E2, however, the spasm induced by dopamine was delayed in onset, less in incidence, and usually less intense. Possible explanations for such experimental differences are discussed.\n",
      "Fatty acid and ketone body metabolism in the rat: response to diet and exercise. This study was designed to measure the response of key enzymes of ketone body metabolism in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver to diet and exercise, two conditions known to influence ketone body utilization. A 3 (diet: control, high fat, or high carbohydrate) X 2 (kill condition: rested or exhausted) X 2 (training: trained or untrained) factorial design was used to estimate main experimental effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables. Physical training (treadmill running) was associated with a doubling of the activity of skeletal muscle 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, a key enzyme in extrahepatic ketone body utilization. The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of liver ketone body production, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthetase (HMG CoA synthetase), was not greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of HMG CoA synthetase. Feeding a high fat diet, on the other hand, significantly increased the activity of liver HMG CoA synthetase, indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise. The results of this study indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation, and that trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than untrained individuals.\n",
      "Some mechanisms of reduction of carotenoid levels in chickens infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species, being primarily associated with interference of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen with E. acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with E. tenella infection. Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free diet and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of xanthophyll/kg. Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E. tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids. Chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed to a xanthophyll-free diet. In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks inoculated with E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption. Conversely, a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with E. acervulina. Studies of uninoculated chicks pair-fed with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E. tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal pH are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection. The studies involving uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes between high and low xanthophyll diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin.\n",
      "Metabolic studies on the development of ethanol-induced fatty liver in KK-Ay mice. Mechanisms involved in the development of the alcoholic fatty liver in KK-Ay mice were investigated. Incorporation studies using [14C]acetate and [3H]palmitate indicated that the half-life of hepatic triglycerides was doubled in the ethanol-ingesting mice, and utilization of the exogenous fat was significantly increases as compared with that of the control. No persistent alteration was recognized in hepatic oxidation of palmitate, as estimated by in vitro experiments using liver slices obtained from control and ethanol-drinking mice. Enzymic studies indicated that the activities of acetyl COA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were increased with ethanol drinking. The increment in hepatic triglycerides accumulated during ethanol ingestion was largely accounted for by palmitoleic, oleic, and linoleic acids. These findings demonstrated an augmentation in hepatic lipogenesis as well as an increased utilization of exogenous fats. Ethanol drinking did not cause any appreciable change in plasma triglyceride level and metabolism of adipose tissue. In summary of the present studies, accelerated lipogenesis and increased utilization of the dietary fats may be possible causal factors in the alcoholic fatty liver of KK-Ay mice.\n",
      "Renal response to acid loading in the developing lamb fetus, intact in utero. Response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal lambs, 115-125 days gestation, in order to evaluate the renal contribution to elimination of hydrogen ion during intra-uterine development. Experiments were conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study. A metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg, intravenously over a period of 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output. During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 to 4, Tabs. III to IV). Lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours later. Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours. Ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion. The acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate. During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800 mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount. The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion. During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36 to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2 (Figs. 1 to 2, Tabs. I to II). During the following three hours of recovery, pH rose gradually to 7.29, base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 mEq/L and 8.7 mM/L respectively. Since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small, the decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as placental transfer. These experiments indicate that, in the lamb fetus, intact in utero, the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms, is capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to fetal homeostasis. The increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss of sodium and chloride in the urine.\n",
      "Recognition and significance of maternogenic fetal acidosis during intensive monitoring of labor. FHR monitoring and microanalysis of fetal blood are mutually complementary procedures, and optimal knowledge of the fetal state is achieved by making use of both, the former for the preliminary screening of all cases at risk and the latter for the purpose of deciding on obstetric management where pathological changes are evident in the FHR. The major difficulty in obtaining a precise value for the fetal acid-base balance lies in the occurence of \"falsely abnormal\" cases, i.e. cases in which the fetal pH falls during labor but the clinical condition at birth is good (APGAR greater than or equal to 7). In our own series the incidence of such cases among fetuses at risk was 11.2% (Tab. I). In the majority of these cases the fetal acidosis is thought to be a result of increased metabolic acidosis in the mother (maternogenic fetal metabolic acidosis). The importance of the maternogenic fetal acidosis during labor lies in the fact that unless it is recognised, rapid extraction of the fetus will appear necessary on clinical grounds, although it is in fact unnecessary, since this form of acidosis has no adverse effect on the fetus. Various parameters have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of the maternogenic fetal acidosis. These include the feto-maternal difference in base deficit (F/M deltaBD), the materno-fetal differences in pHqu 40 (M/F deltapHqu 40) the materno-fetal difference actual pH (M/F actual deltapH), and the materno-fetal difference in base deficit of the extra-cellular fluid (M/F deltaBDHb5). A critical analysis of these parameters has been carried out on the results of microtests performed during a 5 year period (1968-1972) at the First Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Milan University. The cases comprised 59 regarded as normal (normal course of pregnancy, spontaneous commencement of labor at term, clear amniotic fluid, regular FHR, spontaneous birth, APGAR at 90 sec between 8 and 10, weight at birth greater than 2500 g), and 335 considered to be at risk (maternal disease, presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid and/or abnormal changes in FHR). In all of these cases the FHR was recorded by cardiotokography, and the tracings were interpreted according to HON. Microsamples of blood were taken from both mother and fetus during labor and the following determinations were carried out: actual pH, pHqu 40, Hb concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, base deficit Hb5 (BDHb5). The maternofetal differences were then calculated. The same determinations were carried out on samples of maternal blood and of arterial and venous cord blood taken immediately after delivery. The clinical condition of the infant was evaluated by the APGAR score at 90 seconds after birth.\n",
      "Solubilization and stabilization of the cytotoxic agent coralyne. Kinetic studies were carried out on the ring opening of the quaternary nitrogen cation, coralynium ion (I), to yield 6'-acetylpapaverine (III), on the cyclization of III to yield I, and on a photochemical reaction undergone by I in aqueous solutions exposed to visible light. From the results, it was concluded that: (a) I and III are in facile equilibrium in aqueous solution but appreciable amounts of III do not exist in dilute solutions with pH values below 10: (b) the photochemical reaction of I in water (presumably a photohydration) can be reversed by lyophilization, by heatiing, and by increasing the pH of solutions to values greater than 12; (c) the photochemical reaction of I can be inhibited by protecting the aqueous solutions from visible light, and the rate in the presence of light can be reduced by increasing the concentration of I in the solution; and (d) although the chloride and sulfoacetate salts of I react identically and have similar solubilities in water, it is possible to prepare more concentrated and, hence, more stable solutions of the sulfoacetate salt by including sodium hydroxide in the solvent. The solubility of coralyne chloride remains about the same in dilute sodium hydroxide as in water.\n",
      "Solvolysis of a substituted imidazoline, mazindol. Hydrolysis of mazindol to form 2-(2-aminoethyl)-3-(p-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxyphthalimidine was followed spectro-photometrically in aqueous solutions at temperatures between 37 and 70degree, pH values up to 7.6, and an ionic strength of 0.2. The effects of acetate, formate, and phosphate buffers as well as ionic strength on the observed rate constants were investigated. An interesting nonlinear dependency of the kobs with buffer concentration was noted. The velocity constants declined with increasing hydrogen-ion concentration; the log k-pH profile and rate law are given along with other relevant data.\n",
      "Complexation in formulation of parenteral solutions: solubilization of the cytotoxic agent hexamethylmelamine by complexation with gentisic acid species. The apparent solubility of hexamethylmelamine in aqueous solutions suitable for intravenous use was increased by complexation with gentisic acid. Studies were carried out in the pH 0-8 range. Unprotonated hexamethylmelamine did not form complexes with the gentisate ion, while the hexamethylmelammonium ion appeared to form several different complexes with both the gentidate ion and gentisic acid. Two different solid complexes were isolated and characterized. The solubility increases observed at pH 3.5-5.0 are described by mathematical relationships involving the stability constants of some postulated complex species. From these results, sultable formulations for use as parenteral solutions are proposed. The increase in the apparent aqueous solubility of hexamethylmelamine in such formulations may range from five- to 90-fold, depending upon the pH and total gentisateion concentrations.\n",
      "Inhibitory effect of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate on trypsin activity. The inhibitory effect of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate on the proteolytic activity of trypsin was investigate over the pH 6-8 range. The antitryptic activity was determined using two different substrates: casein and N,alpha-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride. The mechanistic studies revealed the substrate-inhibitor interaction to be the overall major mechanism of inhibition. This interaction was shown to involve substrate depletion, probably involving some primary sites of the natural substrate casein. Some inhibition was also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitior molecules. The interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the substrate were irreversible. The possible therapeutic significance of the inhibitory effect of the surfactant is discussed.\n",
      "In vitro adsorption of diphenoxylate hydrochloride on activated charcoal and its relationship to pharmacological effects of drug in vivo. I. The adsorption of diphenoxylate hydrochloride, a potent antidiarrheal agent, on activated charcoal powder was studied in vitro. Langmuir adsorption isotherms were established at pH 4 and 7, and the maximum adsorption capacity of charcoal for this drug was estimated using these values. Activated charcoal modified the bioavailability of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in vivo. The antipropulsive action of diphenoxylate in the mouse was strongly inhibited in the presence of activated charcoal. A comparative evaluation of charcoal and chromium oxide used as inert, nonabsorbable markers revealed that chromium oxide may be the marker of choic in GI transit studies in laboratory animals since it does not influence the bioavailability of diphenoxylate hydrochloride.\n",
      "Binding of bile acids to cholestyramine at gastric pH conditions. The binding of bile salts to cholestyramine was studied under varying conditions of pH and added electrolyte. The taurine-conjugated bile salts were strongly absorbed by the anion-exchange resin at low pH and in the presence of chloride anions. Glycocholic acid binding was very weak at low pH but increased strongly with increasing pH. The presence of chloride ions strongly decreased the amount of glycocholate bound by the anion-exchange resin.\n",
      "Amodiaquin accumulation by mouse erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei. [14C]amodiaquin accumulation by washed erythrocyte preparations was characterized to permit comparisons with chloroquine accumulation. Erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei CS (chloroquine-susceptible) accumulate amodiaquin by a saturable process that has an apparent dissociation constant for amodiaquin of 7.6 X 10(-8) M and is competitively inhibited by chloroquine, quinine and quinacrine, as is the process of chloroquine accumulation. Within experimental error, the K1 of 8 X 10(-7) M estimated for chloroquine is the same regardless of whether the drug being accumulated is [14C]amodiaquin or [14C]chloroquine. Likewise, the K1 for amodiaquin is the same regardless of which drug is being accumulated. In addition, glucose stimulates and hydrogen ion, cold or interruption of glycolysis inhibits amodiaquin as well as chloroquine accumulation. These findings are evidence that a single process serves to accumulate both drugs. In the absence of substrate, erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR (chloroquine-resistant) accumulate twice as much amodiaquin as chloroquine, and they accumulate more amodiaquin than do erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CS. These differences occur because P. berghei CR infects polychromatophilic erythrocytes possessing a high-affinity, substrate-independent process of accumulation to which amodiaquin has greater access than chloroquine. In the presence of glucose, amodiaquin accumulation by erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR, when plotted as a function of amodiaquin concentration in the medium, describes a sigmoid curve.\n",
      "The neurochemistry of Parkinson's disease: effect of L-dopa therapy. Post-mortem brain material from control and Parkinson's disease patients was examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine the mechanism of action of L-dopa as a therapeutic agent. The activities of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (dopa D), tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase were examined; in addition the tissue levels of dopa, 3-O-methyldopa, dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined. In the non-dopa-treated Parkinsonian patients, the greatest decreases were detected for striatal DA and dopa D, with homovanillic acid and tyrosine hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change. The activities of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase in the striatal nuclei were not different from the controls. The putamen was consistently the most severely affected region. Dopa and 3-O-methyldopa were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients treated with L-dopa shortly before death. The mean concentrations of DA in the striatum of these patients were 1) 9 to 15 times higher than those in non-dopa-treated patients, 2) related to the time before death of the last dose of L-dopa and 3) greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as \"good responders\" as compared to \"poor responders.\" Although L-dopa therapy increased homovanillic acid levels in all brain areas, a preferential increase was observed in the striatum. It was concluded that L-dopa's principal therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease are consistent with its transformation to DA in the striatum.\n",
      "Studies on the mechanism of depletion of striatal dopamine by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine. These experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum produced by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine (alpha-MMT). alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine (alpha-MMTA), the metabolite of alpha-MMT, appears to be the active DA-depleting agent, since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before alpha-MMT markedly reduced both the formation of alpha-MMTA and the depletion of DA. After injection of alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.), the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) rose by 41% at 1 hour. This is probably due to an increase in DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced the decline of DA produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). At 2, 3 and 4 hours after alpha-MMT, the concentration of HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level. The decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from DA. In striatal slices, both alpha-MMT and alpha-MMTA decreased the formation of 3H-H2O and the accumulation of 3H-DA from 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT did not alter the specific activity of 3H-tyrosine or release 3H-DA from the slices, but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine (10 muM). Alpha-MMTA released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated 3H-DA from striatal slices. At low concentrations of alpha-MMTA, the percent reduction in 3H-H2O was much greater than the percentage of 3H-DA released into the medium. However, at higher concentrations, the inhibition of 3H-H2O reached a maximum while 3H-DA release kept increasing. These results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and DA release from storage sites by alpha-MMTA may account for the depletion of DA produced by the injection of alpha-MMT.\n",
      "Characteristics of gastric inhibition by acidification of oxyntic gland area. 1. Gastric acid responses to the test meals were measured in the Heidenhain pouch, gastric and pancreatic fistula dogs, using the intragastric titration method, and monitoring the rate at which a solution of 1-0 N-NaOH had to be added to maintain the pH of the gastric content constant at pre-selected values ranging from 5-0 to 1-0. In this way the pH profile of the gastric acid and pepsin responses to a liver extract meal kept in the Heidenhain pouch or gastric fistula as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine could be determined. 2. A liver extract meal adjusted to pH 5-0 produced a potent and pressure-related stimulation of acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the serum concentration of immuno-assayable gastrin. 3. Graded decrease of the liver extract meal pH to below 5-0 resulted in the pH-dependent inhibition of gastric acid output, which at pH 1-0 was only about 30% of the value attained at pH 5-0. Acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine also showed gradual decrease when the pH of the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from 5-0 to 1-0. This pH-dependent inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion. 4. The pH-dependent inhibition of the Heidenhain pouch response to the liver extract meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine, secretin or metiamide, which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the liver meal. 5. The results indicate that there is a local and gastrin-independent inhibition mechanism of gastric acid secretion activated by an acidified meal making contact with the oxyntic gland area.\n",
      "The influence of pH on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta. 1. The experiments were done on single nodes of Ranvier of Rana esculenta. The effects of tetrodotoxin and H ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise, VA, of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, of the toxin-receptor reaction at neutral pH was determined to be 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 and 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin the normalized value, A, of VA, was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration cT = [TTX]/2-8 nM by the empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On increasing the pH (up to 8-8) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in A. The apparent reduction of cT (as calculated from A) suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions (7-3 less than pH less than or equal to 5-5) reduced A to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid pH on A (A = 0-5 at about pH 5-5). In more acid toxin solutions A decreased again and at pH 4-6 it was about equal to the value in toxin-free solution. 5. When, after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution, the perfusate was suddenly changed to neutral Ringer solution A jumped to a higher value A' as measured 1 sec after the switch. Since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of 1 min, A' reflects the number of Na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution the peak PNa as obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor (cH + 1)-1 with CH = [H+]/KH(E) and KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT). Adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor p'T. 7. Experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) and pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low pH. Moreover, p'T was smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus cH reduced during equilibration. This suggests that tetrodotoxin cations and H ions compete for the same blocking site. A quantitative fit, however, requires additional assumptions.\n",
      "The influence of pH on the rate of tetrodotoxin action on myelinated nerve fibres. 1. The experiments were done on single myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta. The rates of toxin effect were studied either by measuring the maximum rate of rise, VA, of repetitively evoked action potentials or by measuring Na currents during periodic impulses in the voltage clamp. 2. VA measurements showed that in alkaline solutions (pH up to 8-8) the offset rate was unchanged while the onset was slowed in quantitative agreement with an assumed decrease in the active cationic form of tetrodotoxin. 3. Both VA measurements and those in the voltage clamp revealed a decrease in T'off, the offset time constant and in increase in the onset time constant, T'on, as the pH was lowered. 4. For tetrodotoxin concentrations, [TTX], up to 400 nM and pH values down to 5-3 the simple relation T'on/T'off = p'R held, where p'T is the constant factor by which the Na permeability was reduced at equilibrium with a given [TTX]. 5. The agreement between kinetic and equilibrium results was also valid when, at constant [TTX] and pH. p'T was modified by the holding potential during equilibration. 6. No unequivocal explanation of the results can be given but some of their features resemble acid catalysis.\n",
      "The formation of synapses in amphibian striated muscle during development. 1. A study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and cross-reinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal (iliofibularis) or a distributed (sartorius) innervation from 'en plaque' nerve terminals using histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques. 2. During the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog, the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate of the iliofibularis myofibres, due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon. 3. The short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of young tadpoles (800 mum long) possessed only a single synapse and the iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during development. However the sartorius myofibres received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion, until the distance between the original synapse formed on the myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about 12 mm. 4. During development synapses possessed either skewed, multimodal, or unimodal m.e.p.p. amplitude-frequency distributions; the intervals between m.e.p.p.s. were not distributed randomly according to a Poisson process, as m.e.p.p.s. of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals; the unit-size e.p.p. had a similar amplitude-frequency distribution as the m.e.p.p.s. if these had a unimodal distribution. 5. Reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of the sartorius and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles, as found in the control muscles of the contralateral and unoperated legs. 6. These observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during development the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation; thus during reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of adult muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites.\n",
      "Comparative studies of Trypanosoma vespertilionis Battaglia and Trypanosoma dionisii Bettencourt &amp; França. In diphasic blood agar media Trypanosoma vespertilionis developed spheroid clusters as compared to rather long, sausage-shaped (sometimes branched) clusters formed by Trypanosoma dionisii. The former species attained a greater population density (approximately 6 X 10(7) organisms/ml) than the latter (approximately 2 X 10(7) organisms/ml). Greater numbers of epimastigotes, some in active binary divisions, were observed during the logarithmic phase of growth, and morphologic changes occurred during cultivation which correlated with increased acidity and a depletion of glucose. Maximum numbers of trypomastigote forms were found during the stationary and early death phases. Most of the forms observed after 20 days were sphaeromastigotes. Glucose concentrations decreased to 0 M in T. vespertilionis and to 4.4 X 10(-5) M in T. dionisii cultures during the stationary and death phases. By the 12th day of incubation cultures of T. vespertilionis were more acid (pH 5.5) than those of T. dionisii vespertilionis and T. dionisii contained common and specific antigens. At least 2-3 common antigens were detected in extracts reacted against heterologous antisera. Specific antigens were observed as nonidentical lines formed by extracts reacted against homologous and heterologous antisera and with antisera absorbed with heterologous antigens. At least 2 specific antigens were evident in extracts of T. vespertilionis and 1 in extracts of T. dionisii.\n",

      "N-Isopropyl derivatives of dopamine and 5,6-dihydroxy-2-aminotetralin. Secondary and tertiary amino homologs of the title compounds have been prepared, bearing an N-isopropyl group. In peripheral evaluation, certain members of the series exhibited beta-adrenergic agonist effects of lower activity than isoproterenol. N-Methyl-N-isopropyl-5,6-dihydroxytetralin exhibited marked properties consistent with its being an alpha agonist, and it is concluded that introduction of considerable bulk about the nitrogen of a catecholamine does not a priori destroy alpha-agonist effects. The compounds qualitatively paralleled the effects of dopamine in assays based upon direct intrastriatal administration in rats, although they were less potent than dopamine.\n",
      "Phospholipases. III. Effects of ionic surfactants on the phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of unsonicated egg lecithin liposomes. Apparent values of Km and Vmax have been measured for catalysis of hydrolysis of unsonicated egg lecithin liposomes, activated through addition of 0.4 M n-hexanol, by phospholipases A2 from bee and snake venoms and by phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii as a function of the concentration of three surfactants: hexadecylamine, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and dihexadecyl phosphate. For all three enzymes, values of Km and Vmax show little or no dependence on the concentration of these ionic surfactants, demonstrating that the liposomal surface charge is not a crucial factor in determining susceptibility to phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n",
      "Negative potential level in the outer layer of the toad skin. The isolated skin of the toad Bufo marinus ictericus when impaled from the outer surface by glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl shows a voltage profile which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement. The superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution (PDi) is negative with NaCl-Ringer's solution on both sides of the skin, displaying a minimum of -26.7+/-3.6 mV at 6+/-2 mum. Null value is obtained at 19+/-3 mum, with positive values for deeper impalements. Indications of cell impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface. Measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution, made with single- and double-barreled microelectrodes, showed great discrepancies, which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum corneum. PDi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of Na2SO4 or K2SO4 concentration in the external solution, increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration. Substitution of Na by K in the external solution had only minor effects on PDi. Acidification of the external solution from pH 9 is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of PDi. At pH 3 PDi was positive. PDi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to KCl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the stratum corneum. Differences in K and Cl mobilities, responsible for the origin of PDi, were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum, with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation, controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution. Skin potential, short-circuit current and their relationship to PDI were discussed.\n",
      "The avian erythrocyte: a study of fixation for electron microscopy. The quality of ultrastructural preservation of the avian erythrocyte achieved using various fixation techniques is evaluated. Different combinations of initial fixatives, buffers and post-fixation procedures were tested as well as variations in fixative osmolarity, pH and temperature. Of the commonly used initial fixatives (glutaraldehyde, acrolein and formaldehyde), 2% glutaraldehyde, alone in a slightly hypertonic buffer containing divalent ions, produced optimum erythrocyte preservation. The osmolarity was balanced using a non-electrolyte such as a sucrose. The addition of 12% hexylene glycol to the buffer solutions also improves erythrocyte preservation, as evidenced by the increased stability of the marginal microtubules, microfilaments and proteinaceous material. The use of Spurr low-viscosity epoxy resin enables the cells to be collected using low gravitational centrifugation.\n",
      "Hemoglobin solution and the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. 1) A study was carried out to determine the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve of stroma-free hemoglobin solution and factors which influence it, (pH; 2,3 DPG). 2) To simulate acute volume replacement, dilution experiments, in vitro, were performed employing both hemoglobin solution and Ringer's lactate in whole blood. 3) It was determined that stroma-free hemoglobin solution has a left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve which responds to pH change but not to the addition of 2,3 DPG. 4) The dilutional effect of hemoglobin solution when mixed with whole blood in volumes up to 50% was to left-shift the oxyhemoglobin curve, unlike the effect of Ringer's lactate (no change). 5) This may have importance in the hemodynamic compensatory response to acute normovolemic anemia.\n",
      "Effect of antihistamine-antiserotonin and ganglionic blocking agents upon increased capillary permeability following burn trauma. Tiny (0.2% TBS), partial thickness, non-contact radiant heat burns in guinea pigs resulted, within 3 hours, in significant edema formation and protein leakage at the site of the injury. Areas of skin distant to the burn also showed an increase in water content but no protein leakage. Pretreatment of the animals with either chlorisondamine hydrochloride or a mixture of methysergide and chlorpheniramine significantly decreased postburn edema formation and protein leakage. Liquid emulsion autoradiography revealed that leakage of protein occurs primarily in the areas of skin adjacent to the panniculus carnosus. The studies suggest that: the increase in vascular permeability that occurs as a consequence of burn injuries is humorally mediated; albumin leakage is limited to the injured tissues; and histamine, serotonin, and presumably catecholamines play significant roles in the development of this phenomenon.\n",
      "Bacteriophage T4 baseplate components. II. Binding and location of bacteriophage-induced dihydrofolate reductase. The location of T4D phage-induced dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) has been determined in intact and incomplete phage particles. It has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr (dfrts) procude heat-labile phage particles. The structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled. Morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11 protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr, such as antibodies to dfr. Further, cofactor molecules for dfr, such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene 11 product. On the other hand, inhibitors of dfr, such as adenosine dephosphoribose, stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein. It has been concluded that the phage-induced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene 11 protein. The properties of phage particles produced after infection of the nonpermissive host with the one known T4D mutant containing a nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles contained a partial polypeptide, which was large enough to serve as a structural element.\n",
      "Uukuniemi virus contains an RNA polymerase. An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity has been found associated with Uukuniemi virions. The enzyme activity is expressed only after disrupting the virions with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and is absolutely dependent on Mn2+, whereas Mg2+ is not required, a finding that distinguishes this polymerase from those of other enveloped minus-strand RNA viruses. Within the range pH 7.2 to 8.5 no distinct optimum was found. The optimum temperature was between 37 and 40 C. The reaction was not inhibited by actinomycin D, rifampin, or DNase, whereas RNase was completely inhibitory. The partially RNase-resistant product consisted of rather small-sized RNA, which contained sequences complementary to Uukuniemi virus RNA as shown by hybridization to the template L, M, and S RNA species of Uukuniemi virus.\n",
      "Radiographic examination of mandibular lesions in barren-ground caribou. Dental anomalies were observed in 43 of 1,226 barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) taken between 1966 and 1968. In five of these 43 animals, the mandibles had deformities which radiography showed to be the result of dental abscesses in four cases and probably of a trauma in the other. The absence of actinomycotic lesions of the jaw bones of these 1,226 animals, and of more than 500 examined previously, indicates that \"lumpy jaw\" is rare in barren-ground caribou. The authors suggest the use of radiography to determine the nature of bone growth on skeletal remains, in the absence of soft tissues for examination for Actinomyces, either microscopically or by cultural methods.\n",
      "Experimental diarrhea in cynomolgus monkeys by oral administration with Clostridium perfringens type A viable cells or enterotoxin. Purified C. perfringens type A enterotoxin fed orally in an amount of 5 mg caused both vomiting and diarrhea in the monkey only when the gastric juice had been neutralized. Exposure of enterotoxin to pH 4.0 or below rapidly destroyed the activity. All three monkeys receiving sodium bicarbonate and 2.4 X 10(10) viable cells grown in DS medium developed diarrhea, and only one of them vomited once. The diarrhea lasted for 13, 18 and 19 hr. The symptoms were similar to those reported in human cases of C. perfringens food poisoning. These results have verified the general notion that C. perfringens food poisoning should be categorized as a true \"intravital intoxication\". The reversed passive hemagglutination test detected enterotoxin directly in most fecal samples. This method may be applicable for diagnosis of human cases of C. perfringens food poisoning. Neither enterotoxin nor anti-enterotoxin was detected in serum samples taken from any monkey up to 21 days after the challenge. We are tempted to conclude, therefore, that no significant amount of C. perfringens enterotoxin is absorbed from the intestine.\n",
      "[Effect of peripheral counterpulsation on the body of an animal with intact heart]. The effect of lasting peripheral counterpulsation upon the haemodynamics and the main biochemical factors of the blood was studied in 14 dogs with intact hearts. In cases of significant tachycardia counterpulsation in a 1:2 regimen results in only a partial reduction of the resistance to the cardiac output. This does not always permit to prevent the formation of the phenomenon of an elevated myocardial contractility. The haemodynamic conditions are most optimal in a 1:1 regimen of counterpulsation. Slowing down of the cardiac rhythm was achieved by means of hypothermia.\n",
      "[Regulation of interrelation between pulmonary ventilation and circulation]. In acute experiments on 92 cats anesthetized with Urethane and kept under controlled respiration the mechanism of tonic activity of the pulmonary vessels was studied in the presence of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. The tonicity of the pulmonary vessels was recorded during autoperfusion of the vessels of the posterior lobe of the left lung by means of a perfusion pump. Simultaneously, the pressure in the common carotid artery was recorded and the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured. Pharmacological analysis was used for the study of the mechanism of the pressor reaction of the pulmonary vessels under hypoxic hypoxy, and it demonstrated that the pression of the pulmonary vessels that develops under alveolar hypoxy is less distinct under the effect of the ganglioblocking agent Benzo-hexonium, as well as the myotropic agents Papaverine and Chloracizine. The above reaction was significantly inhibited by the blocking agents of the D- and M-serotonin-reactive structures -- Dihydroergothamine, Morphine and Novocain, and it was completely lacking against the background of the action of Izadrine and Dimedrol -- blocking agents of serotonin- and histamine-reactive structures. It can be supposed that the D- and M-serotonin-reactive, and probably also the histamine-reactive structures participate in the regulation of the interrelationship of ventilation and pulmonary circulation.\n",
      "Multiple cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in rat kidney. Using DEAE-cellulose chromatography and Agarose gel filtration we have partially purified a low Km cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase from the 100,000 X g supernatant of rat kidneys. The characteristics of this enzyme included a Km of approximately 4 muM a pH optimum of around 8.0 and a requirement for magnesium. This preparation should be suitable for investigation of possible effects of hormones, drugs and cellular constituents on the cyclic AMP pathway through any direct effects on the low Km enzyme. We have also demonstrated a nonspecific, high Km cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and possibly a specific cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) phosphodiesterase in the soluble fraction from rat kidneys.\n",
      "Effect on aging on plasma renin and aldosterone in normal man. The influence of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was evaluated by comparing young (20 to 30 yr) with elderly (62 to 70 yr) healthy subjects. Despite comparable body sodium-fluid balance in the two age groups, serum renin concentration, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly. The age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake; when upright and during sodium depletion, they were more pronounced. Inverse renin-blood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion (r = --0.44 and --0.47, respectively), but not during progressive sodium depletion. Plasma renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure. Aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly. It is concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin, with parallel lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations.\n",
      "[Immune mechanisms in uremia]. There is both clinical and experimental evidence that cellular and humoral immunity are suppressed in patients with renal insufficiency: observations in organ transplantation and in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes from uraemic patients, investigations of acute and late hypersensitivity reactions, the immune response after active immunization as well as changes of immunoglobulins and lymphatic organs in uraemia are discussed in the paper. The underlying mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood. Lymphopenia, atrophy of the thymus gland, toxic serum factors, induction of enhancing mechanisms by certain serum fractions and metabolic defects of lymphocytes--all were shown to be involved or at least considered to be. At present, however, it is impossible to define their rank of importance and the exact place they may occupy in the genesis of this type of \"natural immunosuppression\".\n",
      "Improvement of renin determination in human plasma using a commonly available renin standard in a radioimmunological method. A new method for the measurement of renin in human plasma is described. The method is based on the introduction of the internationally available renin standard of the Medical Research Council (MRC) London, as a calibration system. Thus, some principal disadvantages of methods expressing results in renin reaction velocity (angiotensin generation rate) only are avoided. Both renins, unknown and standard, react with a sheep substrate preparation and are handled identically throughout the whole procedure including the angiotensin I radioimmunoassay (RIA). The plasma renin concentration (PRC) is given in 10(-6) MRC-renin units (muM/ml). the renin standard is free of angiotensin, angiotensinases, and angiotensinogen; it is stable on storage. Identical enzyme kinetics are shown for both renins. An interference between endogenous and exogenous substrate could be avoided. The potentially harmful influences of proteins from the enzyme incubation mixture of the RIA dose response curve are shown. The use of an angiotensin I calibration system could be omitted. Using a standard renin dilution from 250-0.9 muU/ml also the full biological range is covered. When giving an unrestricted diet the preliminary normal values of PRC are 21.9 +/- 12.6 muU/ml in recumbent and 40.1 +/- 19.8 muU/ml in upright position (n = 16,x +/- s, age 20-35 years). Earlier findings of age-dependency of PRC were confirmed.\n",
      "[Validity of pH measurements by means of micro pH combination electrodes in blood and other biological fluids (author's transl)]. pH measurements in blood or in media containing either proteins or polypeptides and performed by means of micro pH combination electrodes type N 58 (Schott &amp; Gen., Mainz) yield in a systematic error according to the regression line y = 1.135 chi - 0.842, in the range between pH 5.3 and 8.3. This deviation from the real pH value is independent of the protein concentration and amounts to 0.1-0.2 pH units in the  physiological range. The error does not occur if the pH measurements are performed in media which are free of proteins and polypeptides, respectively. If the electrolyte solution within the reference electrode is replaced (NaCl solution instead of KCl solution) the error is distinctly reduced. For this reason, this deviation should be caused by the variation of the diffusion potential across the platinum junctions.\n",
      "The effects of drinking on offspring: an historical survey of the American and British literature. Current research on the effects on offspring of drinking during pregnancy has revived interest in an extremely old topic. Observations made during England's Gin Epidemic (1720-1750) were followed by warnings of 19th-century medical writers that parental drinking could damage the fetus. Many concurring studies were reported in the medical literature from 1865 to 1920. Research interest declined during Prohibition, and authorities later discounted the previous work. Recently a relationship between maternal drinking and abnormal morphogenesis has been again described.\n",

      "Regional study of acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties in the normal human brain at various ages. Acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties were studied at various ages in the normal human brain. In CSF and four brain regions, the inferior olive, the cerebellar cortex, the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex were thus beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase, hexosaminidase and acid phosphatase biochemically quantitated at ages varying between 2 and 89 years of age. Also the membrane latency for acid phosphatase was studied in these regions. No major regional quantitative differences were found with regard to the enzymes studied. Their kinetic properties were also defined. There appeared to exist a regional and intra-areal variation in lysosomal membrane permeability. There was, however, no age related increase in total enzyme contents. The possibility significance of these findings are discussed with reference to the aging process.\n",
      "The late effects of selected immunosuppressants on immunocompetence, disease incidence, and mean life-span. II. Cell-mediated immune activity. The late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cell-mediated immunity in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in the aging process. Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence, surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.\n",

Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate within 4 hours after in vivo administration produced an increase in precursor incoporation into rat thymus RNA and proteins in the whole animal. From these results, together with information obtained from measurements of the tyrosine aminotransferase activity and the action of mitomycin C administered one hour before the injection of hydrocortisone, it can be concluded that the increase in tissue level of the enzyme, consequent to hydrocortisone treatment, results from an increased rate of biosynthesis of the enzyme, which participates in the catabolic processes of proteins in glucocorticoid sensitive thymus cells.\n",

Iodoacetylphenylalanyl-tRNAPhe was used as an affinity label to localize the ribosomal components involved in the peptidyl transferase catalytic center of Escherichia coli ribosomes. When labeling was carried out at pH 5.0, the affinity label could specifically label the ribosomal components which comprise the catalytic center. Analysis of ribosomal proteins which had reacted with the affinity label revealed that a 30 S subunit protein, S 20, was located at or near to the ribosomal binding site of the 3'-terminus of aminoacyl- or peptidyl-tRNA.\n",
      "The value of a histamine H2-receptor antagonist in the management of patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Inhibition of acid secretion by an H2-receptor antagonist (metiamide) was assessed in three patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Metiamide (200 or 300 mg) inhibited acid secretion transiently (2 1/2 hours) by 85 to 100 per cent in all patients. Although anticholinergic drugs alone inhibited acid secretion by only 0 to 35 per cent in these patients, the combination of metiamide and anticholinergic markedly prolonged the inhibitory effect of metiamide. Total gastrectomy was refused by one patient, and was impossible in another; both were treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for five and 10 months. A third patient was treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for three weeks in preparation for total gastrectomy. Ulcer pain and diarrhea disappeared, and each gained weight. H2-receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of some patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n",
      "Histamine receptors in the vasculature of the rabbit ear. Histamine has a dual action on the isolated perfused ear preparation of the rabbit. The amine induced a dose-dependent rise in perfusion pressure when the preparation was perfused with Krebs' solution. This pressor response was reversed to a depressor effect when meypramine was added to the perfusion fluid. This depressor effect of the amine was also dose-related. Metiamide competitively inhibited the depressor effect of histamine. Prior treatment of the ear vessels with metiamide alone caused an increase in histamine-induced perfusion pressure. From these results it was concluded that the predominant pressor effect of histamine on the vascular bed of the rabbit ear is mediated through the H1-receptors and the depressor effect of the amine through histamine H2-receptors.\n",
      "Relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists in the rabbit pulmonary artery. The rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which meidate smooth muscle contraction; its noradrenergic nerves contain presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter evoked by nerve impulses. Dose-response curves for the pre- and postsynaptic effects of eight alpha-receptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine, corticosterone and propranolo. 1. According to the concentrations which caused 20% of the maximal contraction (EC20 post), the postsynaptic rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than methoxamine. The pA2 values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline, phenylephrine, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were 7.43, 7.48, 7.59 and 7.69, respectively. 2. For the investigation of presynaptic effects, the arteries were preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline. All agonists inhibited the overflow of tritium evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation. According to the concentrations which reduced the stimulation-induced overflow by 20% (EC20 pre), the rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. 10(-5) M phentolamine shifted the presynaptic dose-response curves for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the right. 3. The ratio EC20 pre/EC20 post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post- and presynaptic potency. According to the ratios, the agonists were arbitrarily classified into three groups. Group 1 (ratio about 30: preferentially postsynaptic agonists) comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine; group 2 (ratio near 1; similar pre- and postsynaptic potencies) comprised noradrenaline, adrenaline and naphazoline; group 3 (ratio below 0.2; preferentially presynaptic agonists) comprised oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline (as well as clonidine). 4. Preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation. Methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced, but never reduced, the response. In contrast, oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency (0.25-2Hz). 5. It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies, possibly because of structural differences between pre- and postsynaptic alpha-receptors. Pre- and postsynaptic components contribute to their overll postsynaptic effec in actively transmitting synapses. The preferential activation of presynaptic alpha-receptors results in alpha-adrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission.\n",
      "Investigation into some imidazoline compounds, with respect to peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and depression of cardiovascular centers. Peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation was tested by means of hypertensive effects of the drugs following i.v. injection in spinal rats. Naphazoline (NP), oxymetazoline (OM), St 91-2-(2,6-diethylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and St 1697--2-(2-ethyl, 6-methylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--were 3 to 5 times more potent in tthis respect thatn clonidine (CLON) whereas St 363--2-(2,4-dichlorophenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and xylazine (XY) exerted only approx. 1/20 the effect of that of clonidine. Sympathoinhibitory activity after i.v. injection was tested by the bradycardiac effect in vagotomized rats; St 1697, St 363 and XY were active, approx. 1/10-1/30 of CLON, whereas NP, OM and St 91 were inactive. However, following intracisternal (i.ci.) injection of cardiovascular depression, typical for clonidine: (1) in dogs with blocked beta-adrenoceptors, the drugs facilitated the vagally meditated cardiodepressor reflex in response to baroreceptor stimulation by i.v. injection of angiotensin; (2) in dogs treated with atropine and in (3) vagotomized cats (only NP, OM and St 363) a long lasting decrease in heart rate was observed. Some of the experiments were complicated by increases in blood pressure, due to the \"leakage\" of small amounts of the highly vasopressor active drugs, from the cisternal spaces into the peripheral circulation. The majority of results indicated, that the central cardiovascular depressor effects of the tested drugs depend on their alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulating potency and on their ability to penetrate from cerebrospinal fluid or from the blood to cardiovascular centers. Relationships between the ability for penetration and the lipoid affinity are discussed.\n",
      "The regulation of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase. Effects of gamma hydroxybutric acid and healperidol. Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHBA) in doses that increased the striatal dopamine (DA) content of rat brain failed to increase the affinity of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) for its pterdine cofactor or to change the sensitivity of the enzyme to the inhibition by DA. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg) decreased the apparent Km of striatal TH for the pteridine cofactor. However, when GHBA was injected before haloperidol it prevented the decrease in the apparent Kn of TH, in a dose related manner. In vitro GHBA (10(-4) M) neither changed the stimulation of the striatal adenylyl cyclase by DA nor its inhibition by haloperidol. These results suggest that in striatal dopaminergic terminals the Kn of TH for the pteridine cofactor is regulated by an molecuular mechanism which requires that the impulse flow in the DA neurons is unimpaired.\n",
      "Host-tumor relationship XXXIII. Inhibitor of hyaluronidase in blood serum of cancer patients. Inhibiting activity of blood serum was determined from the decrease of N-acetyl-hexosamine end groups of hyaluronic acid products released by testicular hyaluronidase. Maximum inhibition was observed within the region of pH from 6.5 to 6.8. Correlation between the serum concentration and its inhibiting effect on hyaluronidase was found within the range of the final dilution of serum (in the reaction mixture) from 9 to 45 X. Blood sera of cancer patients showed statistically significant increase of hyaluronidase inhibitor as compared with that of health people.\n",
      "Influence of peritoneal dialysis on factors affecting oxygen transport. To determine the effect of changing concentrations of uremic metabolites on factors affecting oxygen transport, without the effects of extracorporeal blood pumping, we studied five patients before, during and after peritoneal dialysis. Significant decreases in serum urea, creatinine and phosphate and increase in serum bicarbonate were not associated with changes in P50, a reflection of hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. High erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentrations decreased only slightly. Arterial pO2 increased slightly as negative fluid balance was achieved. The slight changes in oxygen transport parameters with dialysis suggest an interplay of compensatory factors and do not warrant modifying dialysis to limit the correction on acidosis or hyperphosphatemia. Effects on hemoglobin and pO2 resulting from fluid loss can be the dominant influence of peritoneal dialysis on tissue oxygenation.\n",
      "Some effects of ammonium salts on renal histology and function in the dog. NH4Cl was infused into the left renal artery of anesthetized dogs at 50-125 mum/kg/min for up to 110 min. Renal blood flow declined early then increased to supra-control levels during infusion. Kidneys perfused at 125 mum/kg/min for 90 min showed patchy to confluent mixtures of cortical necrosis and tubular necrosis. Experimental kidneys invariably showed lower urine osmolality than contralateral controls 48 h after perfusion. Kidneys with necrosis showed depressed creatinine clearance as well. Renal artery infusion of NH4 acetate or intravenous infusion of NaHCO3 during arterial infusion of NH4Cl prevented significant acidosis and caused minimal histological changes, but depression of urine osmolality was not prevented. It is concluded that renal ammonium concentrations up to 40 mum/liter for 90 min does not cause tubular necrosis but does impair urine concentration. Severe tissue damage followed renal exposure to high ammonium concentrations in the presence of metabolic or renal acidosis.\n",
      "Papillary necrosis associated with calyceal arteritis. The renal papilla has a double blood supply - from both the vasa recta and the calyceal arteries. The importance of the latter supply is not established. A case of polyarteritis associated with papillary necrosis is reported, in which the calyceal vessels, supplying the area, show acute necrotizing arteritis and occlusion. The pathophysiological and clinical implications are discussed.\n",
      "Fasting uric acid and phosphate in urine and plasma of renal calcium-stone formers. Clearance experiments in calcium-stone patients (n = 60) and controls (n = 60) demonstrated significantly higher urinary uric acid (UA) in younger (less 40 years) stone patients than controls (median: 480 vs. 351 mug/min) but not in older (greater than 40 years) patients. Serum UA and urinary oxypurines were comparable in health and stone disease. Conversely urinary phosphate was significantly lower in younger patients than matched controls (males: 224 vs. 304 mug) and presumably is responsible for the more alkaline pH. It is suggested that calcium-stone formation in humans is represented by two different populations.\n",
      "Effects of varying dialysate calcium concentrations on the plasma calcium fractions in patients on dialysis. The plasma-ionized calcium levels decreased during haemodialysis when a dialysate calcium concentration of 5 mg/100 ml was used. When dialysis was performed with a bath calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/100 ml, there was a significant increase in the plasm-ionized calcium levels in the post-dialysis period. These results are discussed in relation of the optimal dialysate calcium concentrations and development of dialytic bone disease.\n",
      "[Borderline between antiepileptic and psychopharmacological drugs (author's transl)]. From the chemical and pharmalogical point of view it is impossible to separate strictly between antiepileptic and psychopharmalogical drugs. Inspite of that and several clinical overlappings it is possible and helpful finding differences between the two groups of drugs. Basing on the indication we try to demonstrate the use of these drug-groups. 1. Antiepileptic drugs in behaviour disorders. A. In spite of various publications we recommend carefullness and restriction. B. Only in case of behaviour disorders due to epileptic origin antiepileptic therapy is indicated. 2.

      "Identification, purification and properties of clone-specific glycoprotein antigens constituting the surface coat of Trypanosoma brucei. Soluble glycoproteins have been purified from a series of clones of Trypanosoma brucei 427. Each clone yielded a characteristic predominant glycoprotein which induced clone-specific immunity to trypanosome infection in mice. These glycoproteins were shown by specific labelling and enzyme digestion of cells to be the major components of the trypanosome surface coat. Each glycoprotein consisted of a single polypeptide chain having an apparent molecular weight of 65 000 (as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and containing around 600 amino acid and 20 monosaccharide residues. Preliminary structural studies indicated large changes in amino acid sequence dispersed over a considerable length of the polypeptide chain. Proteolytic activity was demonstrated in semi-purified trypanosome extracts, providing one reason for the heterogeneity sometimes observed in surface glycoprotein antigen preparations.\n",

The determination of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by a reaction rate assay using optimal reaction conditions at 37 degrees is described. Specific conditions and instrument settings are described for the LKB Reaction Rate Analyser but the actual assay conditions are applicable to any similar reaction rate system.

      "The influence of cortisol on the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis in developing mammalian lung and brain. Administration of cortisol to fetal rabbits resulted in a 42% inhibition of pulmonary de novo fatty acid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (P = less than 0.025). This was associated with inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC. 6.4.1.2.) activity (P = less than 0.01) and a tendency towards decreased activity of fatty acid synthetase. There was no effect on pulmonary microsomal fatty acid elongation activity. Light and electron microscopic examination of the apex of the right lung of control and cortisol-treated animals revealed changes consistent with accelerated lung maturation in the treated animals. The in vitro activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase were similar in rabbit lung and thus acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity does not appear to be rate limiting for de novo fatty acid synthesis in lung. No significant change in the activity of enzymes associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis of microsomal fatty acid elongation was found in fetal brain after cortisol exposure. However, in a parallel study on fatty acid synthesis in fetal liver, cortisol administration resulted in a 30% increase in fatty acid synthetase activity (P less than 0.025). The finding of cortisol-induced inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis in fetal rabbit lung may be related to the known inhibitory effect of cortisol on lung growth in the fetus.\n",
      "The relation between myosin adenosinetriphosphatase activity and inactivation of myosin under alkaline conditions of heart muscles in mammals of different size. ATPase activity of myosin in the heart muscle of the mouse, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit and pig was studied at neutral pH and under mild alkaline conditions. At neutral pH the ATPase activity of myosin is inversely related to body size of the animal species. The decrease of ATPase activity of myosin after alkaline preincubation depends on the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin, i.e. myosin from the heart of the mouse exhibits high ATPase activity ae same relationship was found, when comparing myosin of new-born and adult heart muscle. It is concluded that the rate of alkaline inactivation of heart myosin is directly related to the degree of ATPase activity of intact myosin in all animals.\n",
      "Carbon dioxide response curves during hypothermia. The responsiveness of the medullary chemoreceptors, measured by the ventilatory response to hypercapnia given in an hyperoxic gas mixture in intact anesthetized dogs has been evaluated during normothermia and at two levels of hypothermia. The response was studied in: 1) 20 dogs during normothermia, 2) 10 of these dogs at a blood temperature of 32-33 degrees C, and 3) in the other 10 dogs during deeper hypothermia (28-29 degrees C). The ventilatory response to CO2 decreased while blood temperature was lowered until the response became absent during deep hypothermia. For normothermia and both levels of hypothermia a similar oxygen drive of ventilation was found which was equivalent to approximately one fourth of the spontaneous ventilation. It is suggested, that in the deeply hypothermic animal the normal respiratory drive is apparently of peripheral (arterial) chemoreceptor origin and when this drive is nullified or significantly decreased, gentle shivering could be responsible for stimulating the respiratory center.\n",
      "[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated medically by an inhibitor of H2 histamine receptors]. Metiamide an histamine H2-receptors antagonist has been used to treat a case of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome characterized by a long standing diarrhea, an important gastric hypersecretion and a moderatly elevated plasma gastrin but without digestive ulceration. At the dose of 600 mg per day, Metiamide induced a complete suppression of acid secretion, an effect which lasted for 15 days after stopping the drug. Accordingly and since the only finding at time of laparotomy was a small lymph node enlarged with endocrine metastatic tissue, the stomach was left intact and Metiamide pursued. During the first 4 months of chronic administration of Metiamide, acid secretion was maintained at levels below 25 p.cent of initial values. Ulteriorly however, although dosages of Metiamide were increased, acid hypersecretion resumed and a duodenal ulcer developed. Total gastrectomy was then performed 11 months after the beginning of Metiamide. In spite of the failure of Metiamide treatment, the long term follow up of this case of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, allowed us to get theoretical and practical informations.\n",
      "[Exercise test in the asthmatic patient. Study of 75 patients]. Frequency of exercise-induced asthma has been studied in 75 unselected asthmatic patients (adults and children) by measuring the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) and the vital capacity (VC) before and after a treadmill exercise, continued until heart rate was at least equal to 80 p.cent-85 p.cent of maximum heart rate. In 19 subjects (25 p.cent), a more than 20 p.cent decrease from control value of FEV1 was recorded ten minutes after exercise ended. Exercise-induced bronchial obstruction was relieved by a beta adrenergic bronchodilator aerosol inhalation. In the group of 19 subjects having exercise-induced asthma, a significant positive correlation was found between pre-exercise FEV1 values and post-exercise FEV1 decreases. In the whole group of 75 subjects exercise-induced asthma was related to the severity of asthma and not to other clinical or physical characteristics of the subjects. From the data of other authors it appears that frequency of exercise-induced asthma is variable. The reasons of those differences are discussed.\n",

      "Intranasal betamethasone valerate in seasonal rhinitis. A double-blind study comparing betamethasone valerate and placebo aerosols was carried out in 40 patients with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and positive skin tests to grass pollens. Analysis of the symptoms recorded on a daily record card for a period of one month indicated that the mean monthly symptom-score was lower for all symptoms in the group on active therapy and that this reached statistical significance for the symptom of sneezing. Significantly more antihistamine tablets were used by the placebo group as compared with the active group (p less than 0-05). The patients' assessment of their treatment was in favour of betamethasone valerate (p less than 0-05). No clinically significant side-effects were associated with the treatment, which was well tolerated.\n",
      "Urinary acidification in renal allografts. Urinary acid excretion was measured in 35 human renal allograft recipients during the first few days after the onset of diuresis and two months after transplantation. In 16 out of 17 rejection episodes an early significant decrease of renal total net H+ excretion was observed. This urinary acidification impairment preceded the serum creatinine increase. Only few patients showed variations in blood pH and C1-. The acidification defect may be due to the ischaemic changes of rejection. Early impairment of urinary acidification supports a clinical diagnosis of rejection.\n",
      "A simple test for early detection of severe renal homograft rejection. Adding urine to a standard buffered fibrinogen solution and then coagulating it with thrombin gives reproducible coagulation times with normal urines. Coagulation of fibrinogen by thrombin is prolonged in acid solutions with a pH below six. Urines of high acidity lower the buffer pH of the fibrinogen solution below a value of six thus rendering the system uncoagulable or significantly prolonging the coagulation time. With this test system we found that out of 16 severe homograft rejections 15 were accompanied by a high acid excretion in six-hour urine specimens. Ten of these acid episodes became apparent 12 to 48 hr before clinical symptoms and before elevation of the serum creatinine could be detected.\n",
      "Catalysis by acetylcholinesterase: evidence that the rate-limiting step for acylation with certain substrates precedes general acid-base catalysis. Inferences about the catalytic mechanism of acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7) are frequently made on the basis of a presumed analogy with chymotrypsin, EC 3.4.21.1. Although both enzymes are serine hydrolases, several differences in the steady-state kinetic properties of the two have been observed. In this report particular attention is focused on the second-order reaction constant, kcat/Kapp. While the reported pH dependence and deuterium oxide isotope effect associated with this parameter for chymotrypsin are generally consistent with simple models involving rate-limiting general acid-base catalysis, this study finds a more complicated situation with acetylcholinesterase. The apparent pKa of kcat/Kapp for acetylcholinesterase varies between 5.5 and 6.3 for neutral substrates and involves nonlinear inhibition by [H+]. Deuterium oxide isotope effects for kcat/Kapp range from 1.1 for acetylcholine to 1.9 for p-nitrophenyl acetate. The bimolecular reaction rate appears rate-limiting for acetylcholine at low concentrations, while a rate-limiting induced-fit step is proposed to account for apparent pKa values and low deuterium oxide isotope effects associated with low concentrations of phenyl acetate and isoamyl acetate.\n",
      "Light-dependent absorption and selective scattering changes at 518 nm in chloroplast thylakoid membranes. The light-induced absorbance change at 518 nm of isolated chloroplasts consists of a rapid phase, and a slow phase which is complete in about 20 sec. The slow component of the 518 nm absorbance change correlates with the light-induced change in 90 degrees light scattering at 518 nm. Both show a similar time course, similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde. Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm. It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering. It is proposed that the light-induced changes in scattering at 518 nm reflect alterations in selective dispersion, due to proton uptake and conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.\n",
      "phiX174 DNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro: requirement for P1 ban protein in dnaB mutant extracts of Escherichia coli. Ammonium sulfate fractionation of crude extracts of E. coli yields a soluble enzyme fraction (about 25-fold purification) that catalyzes the conversion of phiX174 single-stranded DNA to duplex DNA. The reaction is rifampicin-resistant, requires single-stranded DNA, Mg++, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and ATP, and is stimulated by KCl. Such soluble enzyme fractions were prepared from E. coli strains carrying the prophage mutant P1bac, in which the viral dnaB analog (ban) protein is expressed constitutively, or P1bacban, in which the expression of ban protein is prevented. DNA-synthesizing activity of ban protein containing fractions from wild-type or dnaB(P1bac) lysogens was more temperature-resistant than that from E. coli containing only wild-type dnaB protein, whereas that from dnaB(P1bacban) lysogens of dnaB cells was extremely thermolabile. It is suggested that the temperature-resistant DNA synthesis with fractions from P1bac lysogens is mediated by the P1 ban protein.\n",
      "Intramolecular arsanilazotyrosine-248-Zn complex of carboxypeptidase A: a monitor of catalytic events. The intensely chromophoric intramolecular coordination complex formed between arsanilazotyrosine-248 and the active site zinc atom of azocarboxypeptidase A (Johansen, J. T. &amp; Vallee, B. L. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68, 2532-2535) is a spectrokinetic probe of catalytic events. The interconversion of the azoTyr-248-Zn complex and its constituents is measured by stopped-flow pH and temperature-jump methods. The rate of interconversion, 64,000 sec-1, is orders of magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself (about 0.01-100 sec-1). Rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the azoTyr-248-Zn complex before hydrolysis occurs. As a consequence, formation of azoTyr-248, substrate binding, and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually in progress. The results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic events, different from those postulated based on x-ray structure analysis. If azoTyr-248 is displaced, the direction is opposite to the inward movement postulated on the basis of x-ray studies and is not unique to induction by substrates, since rapid changes in pH also result in analogous spectral changes. AzoTyr-248 carboxypeptidase has all the features which are essential for mechanistic studies: (1) It is enzymatically active; (2) the spectra of the metal complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents; (3) it responds dynamically to environmental factors; and (4) the response time of the probe itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic step. These combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render it a powerful spectrokinetic probe to visualize and discern microscopic details of the catalytic process.\n",
      "Ubiquinone-mediated coupling of NADH dehydrogenase to active transport in membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli. Addition of ubiquinone-1 to E. coli ML 308-225 membrane vesicles dramatically increases coupling between NADH oxidation and active transport such that initial rates and steady-state levels of lactose and amino-acid accumulation are comparable to those observed during D-lactate oxidation. Similar but less dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or L-lactate. In the presence of NADH and ubiquinone-1, the vesicles also generate a membrane potential (interior negative) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of D-lactate. Stimulation of NADH-dependent transport by ubiquinone-1 cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of NADH, and the effect of the quinone on NADH-dependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of NADH dehydrogenase activity. Thus, it is apparent that ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase [NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energy-coupling site. The findings demonstrate unequivocally that inefficient coupling of NADH oxidation to active transport cannot be due to the presence of inverted vesicles. In addition, they provide further support for specific localization of the energy-coupling site.\n",
      "Protection of lethally irradiated mice with allogeneic fetal liver cells: influence of irradiation dose on immunologic reconstitution. After lethal irradiation long-lived, immunologically vigorous C3Hf mice were produced by treatment with syngeneic fetal liver cells or syngeneic newborn or adult spleen cells. Treatment of lethally irradiated mice with syngeneic or allogeneic newborn thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or adult spleen cells regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graft-versus-host reactions. Treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly yielded long-lived, immunologically vigorous chimeras. The introduction of the fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development of immunological tolerance of the donor cells. The findings suggest that T-cells at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction than are T-lymphocytes at later stages of differentiation. These investigations turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may injure the thymic stroma, rendering it less capable of supporting certain T-cell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue. Alternatively, the higher and not the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain cell-mediated immune functions, e.g., graft-versus-host reactions, but which is not important in others, e.g., allograft rejections. The higher dose of lethal irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen cells that could initiate graft-versus-host reactions but did permit the development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous allograft rejection. These observations contribute to understanding of some of the persisting immunodeficiencies that are observed in man after fatal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. These results should suggest better approaches to more effective cellular engineering for correction of immunodeficiency diseases and for treatment of immunodeficiency diseases and of leukemias and malignancies of man.\n",
      "Mechanism of action of penicillin: triggering of the pneumococcal autolytic enzyme by inhibitors of cell wall synthesis. During penicillin treatment of an autolysin defective mutant pneumococcus we have observed three novel phenomena: (i) Growth of the mutant cultures is inhibited by the same concentrations of penicillin that induce lysis in the wild type. (ii) Mutant bacteria treated with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration of penicillin will lyse upon the addition of wild-type autolysin to the growth medium. Chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of protein synthesis protect the cells against lysis by exogenous enzyme. Sensitivity of the cells to exogenous autolysin requires treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis (e.g., D-cycloserine or fosfonomycin) since exogenous autolysin alone has no effect on bacterial growth. (iii) Treatment with penicillin (or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis) causes the escape into the medium of a choline-containing macromolecule that has properties suggesting that it contains pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid (Forssman antigen). Each one of these three phenomena (growth inhibition, sensitization to exogenous autolysin, and leakage of lipoteichoic acid) shows the same dose response as that of the penicillin-induced lysis of wild-type pneumococci. On the basis of these findings we propose a new hypothesis for the mechanism of penicillin-induced lysis of bacteria. It is suggested that inhibition of cell wall synthesis by any means triggers bacterial autolytic enzymes by destabilizing the endogenous complex of an autolysin inhibitor (lipoteichoic acid) and autolytic enzyme. Escape of lipoteichoic acid-like material to the growth medium is a consequence of this labilization. Chloramphenicol protects bacteria against penicillin-induced lysis by interfering with the activity of the autolytic enzyme, rather than by depleting the concentration of the enzyme at the cell surface.\n",
      "Identification of NADPH-thioredoxin reductase system in Euglena gracillis. Euglena gracilis contains a protein system which can utilize the reducing power of NADPH in the ribonucleotide reductase-catalyzed reduction of CTP. The proteins required for this reaction are a flavoprotien with a molecular weight of approximately 185,000 which is functionally similar to thioredoxin reductase (NADPH), EC 1.6.4.5, and another protein (Protein I) whose function in the reaction is unknown. This new protein does not appear to contain a prosthetic group and has a molecular weight of approximately 240,000. In addition, the ribonucleotide reductase active in the Euglena NADPH-thioredoxin reductase system is more complex than the protein reported in a previous publication [(1974) j. Biol. Chem. 249, 4428-4434]. The enzyme preparation described in this report contains four different types of polypeptide chains which may complex to form the active enzyme.\n",
      "Purification of folate binding factor in normal umbilical cord serum. Human umbilical cord serum was found to contain both free folate and folate complexed to a high-molecular weight factor. The complexed folate was bound to a very high affinity binder and was present in concentrations equivalent to as much as 60 ng of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid per ml of serum. Acidification of the serum caused disassociation of the folate-binder complex. Released folates were separated from binder by Sephadex gel filtration, zonal centrifugation through sucrose gradients, or adsorption onto activated charcoal. The separated binding factor, either saturated or unsaturated with folate, had a molecular weight of about 40,000 on Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Binding of [3H]pteroylglutamic acid was rapid and, as in the original endogenous folate-binder complex, was essentially irreversible at neutral pH. The affinity and specificity of the binder were examined by competition experiments using [3H]pteroylglutamic acid and nonradioactive folate derivatives. Oxidized folates were bound in preference to reduced derivatives, but only three to four times more unlabeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid than pteroylglutamic acid was required to produce an equal level of competition. The strong affinity for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, the main serum folate, suggests that the binder could be part of the mechanism by which the fetus concentrates maternally supplied folate for its growth and development.\n",
      "Intramolecular arsanilazotyrosine-248-Zn complex of carboxypeptidase A: a monitor of multiple conformational states in solution. The red azoTyr-248-Zn complex of arnilazocarboxypeptidase, previously used to demonstrate differences in conformation of the enzyme in crystals and in solution, has now provided means to detect multiple conformations of the enzyme in solution by stopped-flow pH and temperature jump experiments. These studies identify two distinct processes. Er + H+ in equilibrium Ey (I), is the extremely rapid, Kfast about 10(5) sec-1, pH dependent dissociation of the metal complex. Ey in equilibrium Ey' (II), is much slower, Kslow about 5 sec-1, pH independent interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules, Ey and Ey', in which the yellow azo-Tyr-248 is different conformations. These two conformations can be differentiated readily by stopped-flow pH-jump experiments, since I is three to four orders of magnitude faster than II. Mathematical expressions derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the pH range from 6.0 to 8.5. In a previous stopped-flow pH-jump experiment, Lipcomb and coworkers [Quiocho, F. A., McMurray, C. H. &amp; Lipcomb, W. H. (1972), Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2850-2854] recognized only a single process with a rate constant of about 6 sec-1, but not the major, very rapid rate observed here. The failure to detect this fast process led to the postulation of a number of explanations intended to account for the detection of only a single, slow rate. The present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not valid. The azoprobe reveals the existence of rapidly interconvertible substructures of carboxypeptidase A, and the results support the view that in solution, enzymes can adopt multiple, readily interconvertible and related conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis. In crystals, rearrangement of molecular structure could be severely impaired or restricted, and crystallization might single out either active or inactive conformations. In the latter case, such crystals would have greatly reduced activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior, as is observed for carboxypeptidase A. In combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals, conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme mechanisms and select crystals for x-ray structure analysis.\n",
      "Presence of norepinephrine and related enzymes in isolated brain microvessels. Norepinephrine and the enzymes involved in its synthesis and degradation were found to be associated with isolated brain microvessels. The significance of these results are discussed with respect to adrenergic innervation of the cerebral microvessels and thereby neural regulation of the cerebral microcirculation.\n",
      "Disorders of micturition in bacterial prostatitis. Measurements of urinary flow rate were performed in 16 patients with established prostatitis before and after a course of antimicrobial therapy. Before treatment the maximum flow rates were poor with abnormal flow curves and significant improvement in voiding characteristics were observed with treatment (P less than 0.01). A preliminary electrophysiological (EMG) study of sphincter activity suggested that the obstruction to the flow of urine was at least in part due to failure of the external sphincter to relax during micturition. Although the total number of cases in this series was small the study showed that prostatitis was associated with a disorder of micturition which correlated with the other clinical features of the disease and could be objectively evaluated. Eradication of infection restored normal conditions in the lower urinary tract.\n",
      "Nonenzymatic reactivation of des-acetyl citrate lyase by acetyl adenylate. First example of enzyme activation by chemotrophic modification. The experimental conditions of nonenzymatic reactivation of des-acetyl citrate lyase from K. aerogenes were studied. It was found that at pH 8.5 0.2 MM acetyl AMP causes a fast reactivation of the enzyme. The pH dependence of activity and the Km for citrate are very similar for both native and reactivated enzyme.\n",
      "Relationship between bovine serum albumin structure and its chemical equilibria with hydrogen and 5-hydroxytryptamine ions. From the analysis of titration curves with hydrogen and 5-HT ions, it was found that the electrostatic interaction parameter of protein macroion and the number sites of 5-HT fixing were smaller over an acid and base pH range as compared to their values at neutral pH. Our data were interpreted by the conformational changes which can be induced when BSA is exposed to denaturation by acid and alkali pH.\n",
      "Some psysicochemical properties of mitochondrial and cell sap alanine aminotransferase from the rat CNS. The authors describe different properties of brain mitochondrial and cell sap alanine aminotransferase. They showed that the mitochondrial enzyme was inhibited by maleate, chlorides, acetate and phosphate with a high ionic strength (over 1.8), that its pH optimum lay between 7.5 and 8.5, that it was thermolabile at over 40 degrees C and that it was salted out from solutions with ammonium sulphate at 0.6--0.8 saturation. The activity of the cell sap enzyme was inhibited by phosphate at an ionic strength of only 0.12, less markedly by maleate and not at all by chlorides and acetate; its pH optimum was about 8, it was thermostable up to 60 degrees C and was precipitated from ammonium sulphate solution at between 0.35 and 0.6 saturation. The authors conclude from their results that two different alanine aminotransferase enzymes are present in the CNS.\n",

By means of two cases of postvaccinal encephalomyelitis following antirabies vaccination has been demonstrated the meaning of these complications. In one of these cases has been presumed a simultaneous illness of quiet rabies. The difficulty of an aetiological diagnostic by the morphological effigy of the encephalomyelitids has been referred. An improvement of the dispensaire-system and of the diagnostic of complications following antirabies vaccination is postulated.\n",
      "The effect of L-dopa on young patients with simple schizophrenia, treated with neuroleptic drugs: a double-blind cross-over trial with Madopar and placebo. Thirteen out of 18 young out-patients with simple schizophrenia under neuroleptic treatment completed a double-blind cross-over trial with Madopar [L-Dopa + benserazid (a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor)] and placebo. Nine patients were given 900 mg L-Dopa + 225 mg benserazid daily, 1 patient received 600 mg L-Dopa + 150 mg benserazid, and 3 patients, 300 mg L-Dopa + 75 mg benserazid. In these doses, L-Dopa was effective against emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, tendency to isolation and apathy, without inducing or aggravating productive, accessory symptoms. The activity score, according to the specific activity-withdrawal scale, was significantly increased (P less than 0.05), whereas the total BPRS score (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) was slightly, but significantly reduced (P less than 0.05). In cases where L-Dopa had to be limited to 600 and 300 mg daily, a tendency to anxiety, distortion of thinking, and a sense of unreality were observed, depending on the dose of L-Dopa. In no case were gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or neurological side-effects observed.\n",
      "The specificity of binding of the narcotic agonist etorphine in synaptic membranes of rat brain in vivo. When 3H-etorphine was administered to rats in a pharmacologically effective dose (0.75 mug/kg intracisternally), the labeled drug was concentrated in synaptic membrane fractions isolated from the brains of rats killed 10 min after etorphine injection. Pretreatment of the animals with the narcotic antagonists naloxone, diprenorphine or l-cyclorphan, blocked the pharmacological responses to etorphine and reduced 3H-etorphine binding in the membrane fractions. The differences between 3H-etorphine bound in synaptic membranes of rats treated with d-cyclorphan (inactive isomer) and l-cyclorphan (active antagonist) were in the same range as the reductions in etorphine binding in antagonist-treated rats, indicating that stereospecific and pharmacologically-specific binding sites in synaptic membranes in vivo were of the same magnitude: about 0.04 pmol/g brain.\n",
      "The cholinergic system and nociception in the primate: interactions with morphine. In Experiment 1 the shock titration task was used to evaluate the antinoceptive properties of 5 different classes of cholinergic compounds in the rhesus monkey. Only scopolamine and high doses of physostigmine were effective in elevating the shock threshold. The apparent antinociceptive effect of physostigmine, however, was difficult to separate from its nonspecific behavioral depressant effect and was probably not related to an increase in cholinergic tone. Experiment 2 examined the interaction of morphine with arecoline, scopolamine and physostigmine. Only scopolamine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and high doses of physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) interacted with morphine in the shock titration paradigm. The multiplicative interaction of morphine with scopolamine was confirmed in Experiment 3 over a wider range of doses. It was concluded that morphine and the cholinergic compounds produce antinociceptive effects through different mechanisms of the pain system.\n",
      "Effects of thienodiazepine derivatives on human sleep as compared to those of benzodiazepine derivatives. The effects of new thienodiazepine derivatives, such as clotiazepam and Y-7131, on normal human sleep were investigated on 5 subjects and compared to those of benzodiazepine derivatives, such as diazepam and nitrazepam. REM sleep was significantly decreased only with 2 mg of Y-7131 and rebound elevation of REM sleep did not follow in recovery 1 and 2 nights. By using partial differential REM deprivation which was designed by us, there was also no rebound elevation of REM sleep noted in recovery 2 nights following 2 mg of Y-7131 medication. REM sleep was not suppressed with 15 mg of clotiazepam, 6 mg of diazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam when compared to the baseline night. With regard to NREM sleep, stage 2 was significantly increased with 15 mg of clotiazepam and 10 mg of nitrazepam, but stage SWS was significantly decreased with 10 mg of nitrazepam.\n",
      "Effect of two weeks' treatment with thioridazine, chlorpromazine, sulpiride and bromazepam, alone or in combination with alcohol, on learning and memory in man. Forty paid healthy male students participated in two subacute experiments of 6 weeks each. In the first trial 20 of them received bromazepam, thioridazine, and placebo double blind cross over for 2 weeks each, and in the second trial the active agents administered to the other 20 participants were chlorpromazine and sulpiride. The tests used were paired associate learning with nonsense syllables and digit memory span. Before testing the subjects took either an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic bitter drink. As in the previous study from this laboratory, alcohol was found to impair learning capacity. Of the drugs used only bromazepam impaired learning significantly, and the combined effect of alcohol and bromazepam on learning capacity was very deleterious. The adrenolytic effect of drugs did not correlate with their effect on learning. Caution is necessary when prescribing bromazepam for active outpatients at least in doses used in this study.\n",
      "Effects of chronic exposure to stressors on avoidance-escape behavior and on brain norepinephrine. A single exposure to a severe stressor (either cold swim or inescapable shock) impairs subsequent performance in a shuttle avoidance-escape task (1), a deficit attributed to reduction in brain noradrenergic activity produced by these stressors. In the present paper, two experiments are described which examine how repeated exposure to such stressors affects (a) shuttle avoidance-escape performance (Experiment 1), and (b) aspects of brain norepinephrine metabolism (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that, whereas subjects receiving the single exposure to cold swim or shock showed a large avoidance-escape deficit, subjects that received repeated exposure to these stressors for 14 days performed similarly to the control group that received no stressor. Experiment 2 showed that, whereas subjects that received one session of the inescapable shock stressor showed a lower level of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and cortex than did subjects that received no shock, subjects that received repeated exposure to inescapable shock or cold swim showed neurochemical \"habituation.\" Subjects that received repeated shock showed elevated tyrosine hydroxylase activity and no depletion of norepinephrine level, and both repeated shock and cold swim caused a decrease in uptake of 3H-norepinephrine by slices of cortex in vitro. Thus, it is concluded that the behavioral and neurochemical changes that were observed after the stressful conditions studied are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in avoidance-escape responding following exposure to these stressful events are due to changes in brain noradrenergic activity.\n",
      "Evaluation of combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment in patients with functional abdominal disorders. 78 patients suffering from various functional abdominal complaints have been trated in a 2 x 2 double-blind design: (a) psychotherapy with Ro 5-3350 (TH/Ro); (b) psychotherapy with placebo (TH/P); (c) Ro 5-3350 without psychotherapy (NIH/Ro); (d) placebo without psychotherapy (NTH/P). Results show that a considerable amount of improvement cannot be ascribed to the two critical factors or the interaction of both, but are due to unspecific influences in the course of treatment. Some of the results concerning the combination of TH and the psychotropic drug pose interesting questions for further research and bare implications for double-blind trials of psychotropic drugs. The results suggest that possibly properties of any psychotropic drug have to be related to a doctor-patient relationship within which the personal problems of the patient are dealt with. In order to evaluate such properties, special methodological precautions have to be taken. These will be briefly discussed.\n",
      "Role of cardiovascular and ionic changes in pathogenesis and prevention of isoprenaline-induced cardiac necrosis. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and blood values of PO2, PCO2, and pH were studied in unanesthetized rats for 8 hours. After a cardiotoxic dose of 20 mg/kg isoprenaline, s.c., blood pressure fell from 117 to 72 mm Hg, heart rate accelerated from 326 to 497 beats/minute, and cardiac work diminished by about 15%. Metabolic rate increased by about 80%, blood values of PO2 rose, and those of PCO2 fell somewhat, whereas blood pH dropped from 7.48 to 7.38, indicating metabolic acidosis. Propranolol (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and verapamil (50 mg/kg, i.p.), both of which almost completely prevented isoprenaline-induced cardiac necroses, inhibited the chronotropic and calorigenic actions of isoprenaline by about 50%. While propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of isoprenaline completely, verapamil enhanced it: blood pressure fell to 46 mm Hg. Isoprenaline-induced fall of blood pH was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil. Decrease of blood pH and cardionecrotisation were enhanced when isoprenaline was given together with 4.8 g/kg ethanol, p.o. In conclusion, hemodynamic actions of isoprenaline, especially hypotension, seem to be nonessential for the production of cardiac necroses. Strong acidification can aggravate the cardiotoxicity of isoprenaline.\n",
      "Alterations in norepinephrine pattern in the damaged myocardium in the rat. In the albino rat, the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single injection of ISO was accompanied by a fall in total NE. Pretreatment with propranolol and pargyline protected against ISO-induced necrosis and myocardial hypertrophy, but did not influence the ISO-induced depletion of NE stores. The depletion of NE stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased intraneuronal metabolism of NE since, in ISO-treated rats, neither cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor MAO activity was altered. The decrease in endogenous NE is not due to a defect in the storage of NE. The ability of myocardium to take up and store NE returned to normal within 48 hours, whereas endogenous levels returned to normal within 5 days, even in the presence of demonstrable necrosis. Thus, there is lack of correlation between chemical and morphological changes, since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of morphologically demonstrable tissue injury, and the function of the adrenergic neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis.\n",
      "Prevention of myocardial Ca overload and necrotization by Mg and K salts or acidosis. The crucial point in the pathogenesis of isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrotization is an abundant intracellular Ca accumulation leading to high energy phosphate exhaustion. Accordingly, in the early stage of the isoproterenol-induced necrotization process, the onset of ATP and creatine phosphate breakdown strictly parallels the acute Ca gain. In this type of necrosis, the Mg losses from the myocardium appear as a concomitant phenomenon. The hearts can be protected against the deleterious Ca overload and necrotization by increasing the plasma concentration of Mg, K, or H ions in order to counterbalance Ca according to the ration (see article). On the other hand, if Mg, K, or H ion concentrations are too low, isoproterenol-induced Ca uptake and myocardial lesions are potentiated.\n",
      "Explanation of the stimulation of microsomal N-demethylation reactions by soluble supernatant fraction. Addition of the cell soluble supernatant fraction to an assay medium containing NADPH generating system, mixed function oxidase substrate and microsomes, resulted in a stimulation of drug metabolism ranging from 12-75%. This stimulation was observed only when the supply of DADPH generating system (isocitric dehydrogenase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) was insufficient, leading to a NADPH oxidation rate which was greater than the rate of reduction of NADP+ during the oxidation of a drug. Hence, under our assay conditions, the soluble supernate (SS) is only providing sufficient NADPH generator, and possibly relieving inhibition by the generated NADP+. Finally, microsomal lipid peroxidation measurements under these same conditions indicate negligible to no peroxidation activity in the absence of SS.\n",
      "An attempt to correlated analgesia to changes in brain neuromediators in rats. The analgesic activity of delta9THC, morphine and sodium salicylate was studied concomitantly with changes in brain stem levels of 5HT, 5HIAA, DA and NA. The results show that a correlation exists between analgesia and changes in the serotonergic system of the brain stem. Furthermore morphine sulfate was found to increase the DA concentration of the brain stem while delta9THC increased NA levels. We conclude that serotonergic system may be of major importance in analgesia while simultaneous changes in this system and/or the DA and NA systems may lead to a more pronounced analgesic activity.\n",
      "Colorimetric determination of 5-aminosalicylic acid and its N-acetylated metabolite on urine and feces. A simple and convenient colorimetric method is described for the quantitative determination of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and N-acetyl-5-ASA in urine and feces after oral administration of salicylazosulfa-pyridine (SASP), the drug of choice in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. N-acetyl-5-ASA is extracted directly from the acidified biological specimen, deacetylated, and the liberated 5-ASA subjected to a modified Bratton-Marshall reaction. The 5-ASA present in the specimen must be acetylated with acetic anhydride prior to extraction. The violet colored product of the Bratton-Marshall reaction has a lambdamax of 560 nm and conforms to Beer's law over the concentration range of 0-70 umg/ml. Average recoveries (+/- S.D., N = 6) OF 5-ASA added to rat and human urine and rat fecal homogenates were 91.6 +/- 4.9%, 102 +/- 6.0%, and 71.0 +/- 4.8%, respectively. Interference by SASP and its sulfapyridine metabolities is negligible. As demonstrated, the colorimetric method is of sufficient sensitivity for application in most metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies conducted with SASP in laboratory animals and man.\n",
      "[Pressures, blood gases, pH, lactate and pyruvate concentrations in the portal venous blood in patients after laparotomy during the first 9 days (author's transl)]. In 24 patients (16 women, 8 men, mean age 60 years), who underwent abdominal operations and who had a uncomplicated postoperative course, a teflon-tube was inserted into the portal vein at the end of laparotomy and remained there for maximal 9 days. The mean values of the portal venous pressure as well as of the portal-central venous pressure gradient are unchanged during the period of all 9 days and are between 7,4 and 7,9 mmHg, between 5,6 and 6,9 mmHg respectively. The arterio-portal venous 0(2)-content difference shows in the mean no fluctuations and is about 2 Vol.%. On the first postoperative day the lactic and pyruvic acid concentrations in the artery and portal vein are moderately, but significantly elevated and decrease to normal values until day 7. - 9.\n",
      "Biochemical and biophysical changes in guinea pigs after acute head injury. Animal experiments were set up mainly to derive additional diagnostic data from the study of biochemical changes after acute head injury. In standardized experiments guinea pigs were subjected in groups of 20 to three identical head injuries, each of either 1.0 J or 1.5 J intensity. The trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man; 40 animals served as controls. During the 60 min after injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shock-like condition or hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals. Superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings. Temperature and respiration were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries. Blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 J injury but even though hypoxaemia was not present 2,3-diphosphoglycerate values and P50 increased, compared with the control animals. The fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor (1.0 J) trauma. Of special significance was the increased activity of malate dehydrogenase and aldolase, found only in the blood of severely traumatized animals, as this could serve as an early diagnostic aid for evaluating head injuries.\n",
      "Total brain ischaemia in dogs: cerebral physiological and metabolic changes after 15 minutes of circulatory arrest. Cross-clamping of the ascending aorta in dogs for 15 min produced severe neurological deficit, observed for up to 20 h. Immediately after restoration of the circulation, the intracranial pressure in the cisterna magna increased transiently to a mean peak of 22.8 Torr (SD +/- 1.7) because of a compensatory increase in systemic arterial pressure, without a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure. The intracranial pressure returned to control values 15-30 min after ischaemia and showed no secondary rise during the 8 h of observation. The electroencephalogram became isoelectric 34 +/- 6.5 s (mean +/-SD) after circulatory occlusion, and was abnormal when it reappeared 5 h 36 min (SD +/- 2 h 4 min) after the circulation was restored. The electrical impedance of the brain increased immediately after ischaemia and returned rapidly towards pre-ischaemic values during re-perfusion. The cerebral water had not increased measurably 4 h after ischaemia. After ischaemia, the lactate concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid increased to 4.7 mequiv./1(SEM +/-0.1) and the pH decreased to 7.17 (SEM +/-0.02); both returned to control values after 3.5 h. The cerebral glucose uptake was decreased 35 min after ischaemia, cerebral oxygen uptake remained unchanged but cerebral blood flow decreased (P less than 0.05 at 90 min). Immediately after cardiac arrest, recovery was impaired more by the presence of focal abnormal brain perfusion than by intracranial hypertension.\n",
      "Oxygen and carbon dioxide dissociation of duck blood. Oxygen and CO2 dissociation of duck blood was studied in blood samples equilibrated with known gas mixtures at the bird's body temperature (41 degrees C) and analyzed in the Van Slyke manometric apparatus and in pH electrodes. At various pH values between 7.38 and 7.55 the Hill plots yielded straight and parallel lines over a wide range of O2 saturation, the Hill coefficient being 2.9. Half saturation pressure P50 at pH = 7.50 was 36 torr. The Bohr effect factor was -0.53. Buffering properties were analyzed by equilibrating blood samples with gas mixtures of different PCO2 at 41 degrees C. The buffer value for whole blood in the range of 3-7% CO2 was 19.3 mMol-L-1-pH-1, the buffer value for true plasma 22.9 mMol-L-1-pH-1. The CO2 dissociation curve constructed using the buffer values had a slope of 0.17 mMol-L-1-torr-1 in the PCO2 range from 40 to 50 torr. The CO2 content of oxygenated blood at PCO2 = 40 torr was 21.7 mMol-L-1. The Haldane effect factor at PCO2 = 35 torr equalled 0.30 mMol of combined CO2 per mMol HbO2. With the values of PO2, PCO2 and pH measured in arterial blood of undisturbed and unrestrained, resting ducks effective dissociation curves for both O2 and CO2 were constructed assuming a metabolic R.Q. of 0.8. These curves are expected to resemble closely the actual in vitro dissociation curves of resting ducks.\n",
      "First apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid, pK'1, of plasma and erythrocytes. The first apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid, pK'1, of plasma and red cells was determined on venous blood of ten healthy, adult, male, human subjects. pH and PCO2 of plasma and red cells were analyzed electrometrically and a micromanometric method was used for the determination of total carbon dioxide content. Erythrocyte carbamino hemoglobin levels were estimated and used for the correction of erythrocyte pK'1. Each blood sample was subjected to the following regimen before centrifugation, 1) As drawn from the antecubital vein, 2) Oxygenated with a 5% CO2, O2 balance gas mixture, and 3) Reduced with a 5% CO2, N2 balance gas mixture. pK'1 of plasma and red cells are presented: (see article). The consistently larger values for red cell pK'1 than the respective plasma data may be attributed to the greater amount of carbamino hemoglobin concentration present in the erythrocytes. A simplified method for the calculation of erythrocyte bicarbonate concentration using the experimentally determined red cell pK'1 value has been formulated. The method involves the use of a regression equation relating plasma and red cell pH, the equivalence of plasma and red cell PCO2, along with the experimentally determined red cell pK'1.\n",
      "The effects of changes in pH and PCO2 in blood and water on breathing in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri. The effect of sustained hypercapnia on the acid-base balance and gill ventilation in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, was studied. The response to an increase in PICO2 from 0.3 to 5.2 mm Hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume and a slight increase in breathing frequency. There was a concomitant rise in PACO2 and an immediate fall in pHa. If PICO2 was maintained at 5.2 mm Hg for several days, ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial, prehypercapnic level within three days. Arterial pH also returned to the initial level within 2-3 days. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that under these conditions fish regulate pH via HCO3/C1 exchange across the gills rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of PACO2. A reduction in environmental pH causes a reduction in pHa but only a slow gradual increase in VG. Injections of HC1 or NaHCO3 into the blood have opposite effects on pHa but both cause a marked increase in VG. It is concluded that a rise in PACO2 results in a rise in VG and that changes in pH in blood or water have little direct effect on VG in rainbow trout. Possible location for receptors involved in this reflex response are discussed.\n",
      "The effect of pH upon fluoride uptake in intact enamel. The relationship between pH and fluoride uptake in intact enamel of permanent premolars was investigated by using: (1) a sodium fluoride dentifrice, (2) a potassium fluoride + manganese chloride dentifrice, and (3) a sodium fluoride solution of the same fluoride concentration. The first part of this paper deals with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from dentifrice slurries and from sodium fluoride solutions of different pH ranging from 7.1 to 4.5. This investigation showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the effect of the pH was significant. The uptake of fluoride in the form of fluorapatite was more than five times larger at the lower pH level. The second part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake (increase in fluoride content) from dentifrices in the same pH range. It was shown that the three agents gave the same initial rate of fluoride uptake (about 50 parts/10(6)/min) at pH 6 and that the rate of fluoride uptake in the outer layer of the enamel was proportional to the hydrogen ion activity.\n",
      "Determination of inorganic pyrophosphatase in rat odontoblast layer by a radiochemical method. The enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPiase, EC 3.6.1.1) from the odontoblastic layer of rat incisors has been studied by means of a radiochemical micromethod. The enzyme was incubated with 32P-pyrophosphate in tris-HCl buffer at 37 degrees C. The reaction was linear with time for at least 45 min, and the pH optimum was found to be 8.8, independent of the amount of pyrophosphate present. Heating the enzyme at 56 degrees C inhibited the enzyme activity rapidly, Mg2+ ions activated the enzyme by 15% at an ion concentration of 4 mM, while higher concentrations were inhibitory. Ca2+ ions and PO43-ions inhibited the enzyme at all concentrations. F- ions did not affect the PPiase at concentrations below 8 mM, whereas higher concentrations had an inhibiting effect. Urea was found to inhibit the enzyme at concentrations above 1.5 M, while EDTA was a strong inhibitor at very low concentrations. The characteristics of PPiase agree well with the properties of the enzyme nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1.) studied earlier.\n",
      "Assessment of denture plaque pH in subjects with and without denture stomatitis. To evaluate the \"resting\" pH and induced pH changes in denture plaque, soft deposits were collected from the fitting surface of the denture, pooled and suspended in water. Plaque pH was determined with microelectrode equipment before and after mouth rinsing with a sucrose solution. A characteristic level in the \"resting\" pH of denture plaque was found in most of 12 subjects tested. pH values below the baseline level were recorded for more than 2 h after a rinse. The pH depressions were more pronounced in maxillary than in mandibular plaque. Further, the pH minima tended to be lower in subjects with denture stomatitis than in controls. No clear relationship could be established between the \"resting\" pH and the concentration of Candida hyphae in denture smears or palatal inflammation.\n",
      "Bioluminescence assay of enzymes obtained from buccal epithelium by superficial scraping. A method is presented for the simultaneous assay of buccal enzymes by measuring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate with the aid of the bioluminescence of luciferase extracts. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was shown earlier to be increased in homogeneous leukoplakias of the oral mucosa. Since smoking has been implicated as an etiologic factor of leukoplakia, G6PDH was measured in the normal buccal epithelium of cigarette smokers. No difference was found in the activity of G6PDH between smokers and nonsmokers when related to the activity of pyruvate kinase, which is known to be invariable in healthy and leukoplakic oral mucosa.

A review. 22 HL-A antigen and mixed leukocyte culture-matched sibling bone marrow transplants were attempted in patients with acute leukaemia (at the National Cancer Institute) to define the toxicities of four different immunosuppressive regimens, the complications associated with warrow engraftment and antileukaemic effect. 73% (16/22) were engrafted as indicated by a change to donor red blood cells (RBC) type, leukocyte, immunoglobulin allotype or by the speed of morrow repopulation and the occurrence of the Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). 12 of 16 (75%) successful engrafted patients developed  GVHD. The current published results of clinical bone marrow transplantation from major centers has been reviewed and will be discussed in relationship to current clinical complications associated with bone marrow transplantation.\n",
      "Current status of treatment of pneumonia. Proper treatment of pneumonia is dependent upon a correct diagnosis. Pneumonia may be due to infectious agents, allergic phenomena, or chemical causes. Treatment regimens are outlined for the various types of pneumonia--pneumococcal, staphylococcal, fungal, and pneumonia due to gram-negative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, to Blastomyces dermatitidis, and to the parasite Pneumocystis carinii. In discussing current concepts of treatment, several well-known methods are emphasized, as well as newer developments, knowledge of which is essential for optimal treatment of pneumonia.\n",
      "'Picture frame' fibres in a carrier of the trait for malignant hyperpyrexia. A member of a family which was known to be susceptible to malignant hyperpyrexia, who was identified as a carrier by the presence of an elevated serum creatine-phosphokinase, has been investigated further. Muscle was examined biochemically, and the study included the sarcoplasmic ATPase-activity, actinomycin, Mg2+ ATPase activity, ATP, phosphocreatine and glucose-6-phosphate. In addition, the calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied. The histochemical analysis of the muscle revealed the presence of a new fibre type characterised by a dense rim of ATPase activity, which gives the impression of a 'picture-frame'. Ultramicroscopic study revealed changes in the mitochondria and areas of myofibrillar disruption with swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n",

      "Gastric emptying of liquids after different vagotomies and pyloroplasty. Gastric emptying of five liquid meals which differ in their physicochemical properties have been measured in control dogs and dogs that have received a Heinecke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty alone, proximal gastric vagotomy without drainage, selective gastric vagotomy and pyloroplasty and truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty. The first two phases of emptying have been computed by the method of least squares to obtain a logarithmic-linear pattern and are expressed as relative rates: The initial post-ingestion process is characterized by beta or the average relative rate of emptying in the first ten minutes, the basic or exponential rate as beta and the change in rate from the initial to basic pattern as deltabeta. Each measure of gastric emptying was statistically analyzed to determine specific differences in rates between the operations studied. We confirmed the earlier claims that pyloroplasty alone does not change the emptying rate of liquid meals. Each measure or phase of emptying varies consistently across the operations from meal to meal tested. Initial emptying after all three vagotomies is significantly faster than control with progressive rate increases as proximal gastric vagotomy is compared with selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty and with truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty, probably indicative of gastric fundal loss of accommodation to volume distention after denervation. The basic exponential pattern of emptying is not lost after any of the operations studied. The basic rate after proximal gastric vagotomy and selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty is nearly identical, slightly delayed from the control rate and significantly slower than the more rapid rate after truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty. Possible explanations for these are discussed and imply a particular importance of the hepatic and celiac vagal fibers, sectioned only with truncal vagotomy, in the regulation of gastric emptying of liquids.\n",
      "Pancreatic enzyme response with an elemental diet. Elemental diets can maintain or slightly improve the nutritional status without a major stimulatory effect on the pancreas. Six dogs were maintained with a regular chow diet, switched to an elemental diet and, subsequently, returned to a chow diet. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct through a duodenal cutaneous fistula revealed the enzyme response to be decreased in a dog maintained with an elemental diet, with no or only a slight weight gain. Return to a regular diet resulted in a return of pancreatic enzyme response.\n",
      "Gastric fibrinolysis. Gastric juice from 15 normals, 20 patients with gastric ulcer and 14 patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis was investigated in respect of its activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates and its content of FDP and plasminogen or plasmin with immunochemical methods. Gastric juice from normals showed no activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates, and no FDP or plasminogen could be demonstrated. In the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric juice showed little or no fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates except in 2, who had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral pH of the juice. These patients had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be demonstrated. It was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis, but to non-specific proteolytic activity (probably trypsin). The patients with erosive haemorrhage gastroduodenitis exhibited quite a different picture. The gastric juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates, the activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates. The activity was inhibited in vitro by addition of EACA and in vivo after administration of AMCA. The occurence of plasmic could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the gastric juice. By comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin. The patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood, but low values for plasminogen and alpha2-M, and the serum contained FDP. These findings in the blood and gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and duodenum. There is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes substantially to the bleeding tendency. The effect of administration of AMCA on fibrinolytic activity and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such a mechanism.\n",
      "Acid-base parameters in the dehydrated camel. The effect of  prolonged (10 days) dehydration on acid-base parameters of camel blood was examined. The pH and PCO2 levels rose significantly in the course of dehydration. This state was comparable with compensated non-respiratory alkalosis found in other animals. The plasma sodium, and magnesium levels rose significantly also. The plasma oxygen and calcium levels declined significantly. There were no significant changes in potassium and phosphate levels. It is concluded that the changes found in acid-base status following dehydration are further evidence of water preservation mechanisms in the dehydrated camel.\n",
      "[Clinical experiences with untreated homologous vein grafts in reconstruction of arteries (author's transl)]. 50 transplantations of homologous vein grafts in reconstruction of arteries are reported on.

Results of homologous vein transplants are similar to those of autologous transplants.\n",
      "The effect of a simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage on cerebral blood flow in the monkey. The hydrogen clearance method was used to measure local and total cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rhesus monkey before and for five hours after a simulated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). CBF remained stable after SAH unless SAH was associated with a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure. In addition, cerebrovascular resistance did not increase after SAH. These results suggest that vasoactive agents in fresh whole blood, and the arterial spasm they produce when added to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), play only a limited role in the pathogenesis of ischemic encephalopathy that follows an SAH.\n",
      "Effects of oxygen saturation and pCO2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues in rabbits. The effect of oxygen saturation and PCO2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues was studied in rabbits. Using a modified Oldendorf technique, 14C-labeled glucose analogues with a 3H2O reference standard were introduced into the cerebral circulation via the common carotid artery, and the radioactivity of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a brain uptake index (BUI). Severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 18%) resulted in approximately a 40% decrease in the BUI of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and a 45% decrease in the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose. Severe hypercapnia (PCO2 = 100 mm Hg) caused a 45% decrease in the BUI of both of these glucose analogues. Hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect. Hypocapnia (PCO2 = 15 mm Hg) increased the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose by 35% of the control value, and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition. When BUI values were plotted against pH rather than PCO2 for the same experiments, there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression. These results are compared with previous findings on pathologically induced changes in brain uptake of glucose analogues, and the possible role of blood flow is considered in detail.\n",
      "Engraftment of allogeneic dog bone marrow. Resistance to allogeneic bone-marrow grafts (AR) was found to occur in many species, including the dog. The i.v. administration of silica particles suppressed AR in vivo in this species.

      "Lactate and pyruvate concentrations, and acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid in experimentally induced intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage in dogs. The effect of blood injected into either subarachnoid space or subcortical brain tissue upon lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was studied in the anesthetized dog. CSF lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) increased progressively following the intracranial injection of blood and reached the maximum level at six hours after injection. These changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). An increase in CSF lactate and L/P ratio in hemorrhagic CSF seems to be caused by two different factors. Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, an increase in CSF lactate with a concomitant rise in CSF L/P ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia, even when CSF is hemorrhagic. The association of an increase in CSF lactate to a disproportionate decrease in CSF HCO-3 was also observed in these animals.\n",
      "A study of variables affecting the quality of platelets stored at \"room temperature\". The effect of variables associated with the donor and with methods of collecting, processing, and storing platelets on the quality of platelets kept at ambient temperature was studied. Changes in structural integrity of platelets, decrease in pH, loss of aggregability, and kinetics in vivo of platelets tagged with 51Cr were used as indicators of the tolerance of platelets to storage. A platelet concentration of less than 2.5 x 10(6) per cu mm, a temperature of storage less than 24 C, and continuous, gentle, agitation were found to be essential for satisfactory preservation of platelet integrity, function, and post-transfusion survival. Platelets from female donors tolerated storage less well than did platelets from male donors, possibly because the lower hematocrit of blood collection from females resulted in greater initial acidity of the concentrate. A number of other variables analyzed appear to be of little or no consequence for successful platelet storage.\n",
      "Dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra and their terminals in the neostriatum. Tne ultrastructural and fluorescence histochemical characteristics of the mature rabbit substantia nigra and neostriatum have been reviewed as a frame of reference for the developmental study. Biochemical investigations were reported on neostriatal dopamine concentrations and the relative uptake and accumulation of 3H-dopamine by this tissue from fetal to adult stages, to provide quantitative data for correlation with the fluorexcence information. The development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life. The initial bipolar neuroblasts, which develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon, are fluorescent as soon as they emerge from the ependymal zone. Their fluorescent axons, which form the nigroneostriatal pathway, reach the telencephalon at day 16 of gestation and ramify extensively in the putamen by day 20, but do not enter the caudate nucleus until several days later. Some of the early fluorescent axonal profiles in the putamen are extremely large. Electron microscopic study of theis stage suggests that the large fluorescent profiles may correspond to axonal growth cones or early synapses. A distinct substantia nigra, pars compacta and reticulata, can be recognized by fluorescence microscopy by day 20 of gestation. Electron microscopy reveals that the young neurons are multipolar with numerous developing dendrites, some of which exhibit early synaptic junctions. The subsequent maturaition of these cells and the neuropil is described. The fluorescent axons of the substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner forming fluorescent islands throughout the neostriatum in late fetal life. Occasionally, minute beaded fluorescent axons are found. These profiles might correspond to some of the axons with varicosities \"en passage\" revealed by electron microscopy. In an attempt to identify further the dopamine-containing axon, the ultratructure of adult neostriatum incubated in 5-hydroxydopamine was reported. Axonal varicosities \"en passage\" containing a dense \"tag\" in the vesicles were found. Most of the tagged boutons did not exhibit synaptic contacts. The possible significance of these finding s as related to dopamine secretion are discussed.\n",
      "[Separation of the hormones of the adenohypophysis of rats by use of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate]. A comparative study of rat adenohypophysis extract and its alcohol fractions was performed by two variants of the method of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel: at pH 9,5 and with the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate at pH 7.2. With the presence of sodium dodecylsulphate four protein zones are found which in the order from the anode towards the cathode are identified as hemoglobin, somatotropin, lactotropin and albumin. It is shown that the somatotropin zone after the extract separation at pH 9.5 is inhomogeneous and consists of somatotropin and hemoglobin.\n",
      "[Properties of NAD-glycohydrolase of the nuclei of the liver cells of rats]. Certain properties of the rat liver cell nuclei NAD-glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.5) were investigated. It is established that its highest activity is at 37 degrees with activation energy equal to 9480 cal/M and with factor Q10 equal to 1.5. The enzyme pH optimum in 0.2 M tris acetate is equal to 6.5 and in 0.2 potassium phosphate - 7.5. It was shown that the enzyme manifests its strict specificity only with beta-NAD, and it hardly decomposes NADP without affecting NADH, NADPH and NMN. The apparent Km value of the enzyme with respect to NAD is established. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide, nicotinamide and to the less extent nicotinic acid inhibit the enzymatic activity of nuclei. EDTA, EGTA, p-CMB, mercaptoethanol do not cause any changes in the rat liver cells nuclei NADase activity.\n",
      "[Some properties of \"soluble\" Na+ and K+-ATPase obtained from various subcellular membrane structures of the brain by use of non-ionic detergents]. A comparative study was carried out of some properties of \"soluble\" Na+, K+-ATPase obtained from different subcellular membrane brain structures by means of non-ionic detergents of triton X-100 and digitonin. It is established that temperature and pH-optima of \"soluble\" Na+, K+-ATPase are close to these optima of the initial membrane preparations. A certain difference is observed in the dynamics of temperature and pH-dependence of Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the extracts from different subcellular structures. The stability of the preparations in storage was investigated. A conclusion is made that more stable enzyme extracts may be obtained by means of digitonin.\n",

      "[Biosynthesis of flavins and its regulation in the yeast Pichia guilliermondii]. The nature of riboflavin precursors was studied in the yeast Pichia guilliermondii. By means of mutants with blocked GMP-synthetase the purine precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to guanylic compounds. Accumulation of 2,4,5-triamino-6-oxypyrimidine, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine, 2,6-dioxy-5-amino-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine (DOARAP) and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumasine occurs in the riboflavin-deficient mutants divided into five biochemical groups. This fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast P. guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthesis of DOARAP by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin; cycloheximide in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process. Consequently, flavinogenesis in P. guilliermondii is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means of retroinhibition mechanism. A change in the content of flavins in the cells has no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase; at the same time iron deficiency in the cells evokes derepression of this enzyme. Incubation of the cells rich in iron with o-phenantroline or alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl also causes derepression of riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by cycloheximide. A deficiency of hem in the mutants which need epsilon-aminolevulinic acid does not affect the riboflavinsynthetase activity of the cells. Evidently, in P. guilliermondii a certain form of nonheminic iron might take part in regulating synthesis of riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis. Riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo. With the absence of flavinogenesis enzymes derepression a genetic disturbance in regulation of purinic nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of flavinogenesis. The properties were studied for 680 time purified riboflavinkinase from cells of P. guilliermondii as well as for three phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at pH 3.5, 5.5 and 8.6, which ARE ABLE OF HYDROLYSING FMN. A change in the content of flavins and iron in the cells has no effect on the activity of riboflavinkinase in this species. Evidently, the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis regulation would be different in P. guilliermondii.\n",
      "[DNases and RNases of Misgurnus fossilis ovocytes]. The pH optima were determined for DNases and RNases of the loach eggs. For DNases they are 5.6 and 7.6 and for RNases - 5.2 and 7.2. It is established that Ca++ activates, and Fe++ has not effect on the activity of acid and alkaline DNases, while Mg++, Mn++ and especially Co++, Zn++, Cd++, Cu++ have an inhibitory effect on them. The activities of RNases is stimulated by Ca++ and Fe++, and inhibited by Zn++, Co++, Cd++ and Cu++. Iones Mg++ and Mn++ do not affect these activities. Localization of the above mentioned enzymes was studied by means of differential centrifugation of egg homogenates. Acid DNase is concentrated only in postmicrosomal supernatant liquid, its activity being inhibited in the presence of the nucleomitochondrial and microsomal fractions. Acid RNase is also localized predominantly in postmicrosomal supernatant fraction. Alkaline DNase is found to a great extent in nucleomitochondrial fraction, and alkaline RNase - in postmicrosomal one.\n",

In experiments on 30 animals and in observations over the course of acute closed craniocerebral trauma in 24 patients is was found that the course and prognosis of a posttraumatic period were dependent on the functional activity of the sympathoadrenal system and cholin- and serotoninergic processes. Based on the data obtained, it is concluded that the character of neurohumoral interrelations can serve as the prognostic criterion in craniocerebral traumas, whereas the information about these processes--in selecting the appropriate therapy.\n",
      "[Incarcerated gallbladder in cholecystitis]. Among 206 examined patients with cholecystitis and similar diseases in 112 (65%) cases, as evidenced by the authors' findings, the gallbladder proved to be non-functioning. Its escape in the biliary system was functional (indirect) or organic (absolute). The main causes of a direct organic escape of the gallbladder are as follows: destructive changes in its walls, strictures, strangulated gall stones, shrinkage or hydropsy. The reliable preoperative diagnosis of an escaped gallbladder by means of accelerated chromoduodenal catheterization, intravenous (infusion-drip) or associated (intravenous-peroral) cholecystocholangiography, correlated with the anamnesis data and clinical signs, rather speaks in favour of cholecystectomy on absolute indications.\n",
      "[Determination of optimal conditions for the electron-cytochemical detection of ATPase activity in isolated nuclei]. The optimal conditions are selected for electron-cytochemical detection of the ATPase activity in nuclei of the skeletal muscles of rabbits and nuclei of Vicia faba L. meristem. It is shown that the previous fixation of nuclei in the rabbit skeletal muscle for 10 min in a mixture of the buffer solutions of 4% glutaric dialdehyde and 4% neutral formalin (1:1) causes a decrease in their ATPase activity by 78% in the medium containing Mg2+ and by 34% - in the medium containing Ca2+; in nuclei of horse bean seedlings meristem it lowers respectively by 28 and 16%. Ions of lead in a concentration of 0.4 mM evoke a decrease in the ATPase activity in the medium containing Mg2+, in nuclei of the rabbit skeletal muscles by 35% and in nuclei of horse bean meristem by 15% in the medium containing Ca2+. The vaule of the residual activity is sufficient for detection of the product of ATP enzymic hydrolysis reaction by activity is sufficient for detection of the product of ATP enzymic hydrolysis reaction by the method of electronic cytochemistry. An increase in the Pb2+ concentration higher than 2.8 mM evokes nonenzymic hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase activity under the electron-cytochemical study is found within the range of pH 6.3-8.5. The product of reaction forms most intensively at pH 7.2-7.5 in the medium with both Mg2+ and Ca2+.\n",

Studied was the possibility to isolate and culture Tr. gallinarum and Tr. tenax on a medium Trimed, proposed by the authors for the isolation and cultivation of Tr. vaginalis. The growth and development of the two Trichomonas species were followed up at various temperatures -- 38 degrees, 36 degrees, and 32 degrees C, in order to establish the most appropriate temperature for continuous cultivation at longer intervals of reseeding as well as the temperature optimum for the fast deposition of great amounts of biomass. It was found that the Trimed medium is suitable for the isolation and cultivation of Tr. gallinarum and Tr. tenax. Temperatures of 38 degrees and 36 degrees contribute to the accumulation of greater amounts of biomass, while at 32 degrees C the growth of these protozoa is delayed and reseeding is to be carried out at greater intervals.\n",
      "Amylase of the thermophilic actinomycete Thermomonospora vulgaris. alpha-Amylase of the thermophilic actinomycete Thermomonospora vulgaris was partially purified. Maximal enzyme activity was obtained at 60degreeC and pH 6.0. KM value was l.4%. The effect of some metal salts on enzyme activity was studied. Enzyme activity was inhibited by by KCN, EDTA, and iodoacetate. Inhibition by EDTA was completely nullified by CaCl2, but the inhibition by iodoacetate was not overcome by 2-mercaptoethanol. Exposure of the enzyme to pH 7.0 and 9.0 for 2 hr. did not affect the enzyme, but exposure to pH 3.0 for few minutes completely inactivated the enzyme. Exposure of the enzyme to 60degreeC resulted in an appreciable inactivation and exposure to 80degreeC completely inactivated the enzyme. Addition of CaCl2, 2-mercaptoethanol, or enzyme substrate the 60degreeC exposed enzyme. However, bovine serym albumin had a protective effect when the enzyme was exposed to 60degreeC but not to 80degreeC. The enzyme was stable in the presence of 8 M urea.\n",

Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) in extracts of human feces resembles alkaline phosphatase in extracts of duodenal mucosa, except for its electrophoretic mobility in starch gel. It is very probable that the normal feces alkaline phosphatase derives from intestinal mucosa. Gall bladder alkaline phosphatase, which is markedly different, has not been found in normal feces. Some patients with acute viral hepatitis or protozoasis excrete an alkaline phosphatase which resembles gall bladder alkaline phosphatase and has the characteristics of 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5).

A simple method is described for the simultaneous determination of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) and 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) in serum. The method is based on the determination of inorganic phosphorus released by the action of the two enzymes on adenosine-5'-monophosphate at pH 9.5 (200 mmol/l tris-buffer) in the presence and absence of L-cysteine. This amino acid at a concentration of 2--10 mmol/l was found to be a specific inhibitor for alkaline phosphatase but with no effect on 5'-nucleotidase activity.\n",
      "Absorption of short and medium chain fatty acids in the jejunum of the rat. The uptake of the shortest six fatty acids (acetic to octanoic) was studied in vitro, using everted segments of rat jejunum. The marked influence of medium-pH and fatty acid chain-length suggests that non-ionic diffusion through the lipoid membrane is quantitatively the most important way of transport, but ionic diffusion through the membrane as well as transport through hydrophilic pores also seem to play a role. Though fatt acids evidently are accumulated in the tissue-fluid, and saturation kinetics, competitive inhibition and sodium- as well as energy-dependence apparently are observed, the transport mechanism is assumed to involve solely passive diffusion, - the concept of a carrier-mediated transport for short and medium chain fatty acids seems improbable.\n",

Authors applied blood-gas analysis in 30 healthy gravid women on 3,3 occassions making out 90 cases altogether by blood samples taken from the pulp of the finger capillaries. As a control 27 healthy non-gravid women were examined for comparative analysis. In 10 cases between the 16. and 28. week the results of samples taken from the arteria femoralis and the pulp were evaluated. It has been found that in the gravidity period of the 16. and 28. week respiratory alcalosis does not appear. No metabolic changes have been found during the whole period of pregnancy. The parallel examination of blood samples taken from the arteria femoralis and the pulp have proved that it is sufficient and reliable to take blood-gas analysis on the material gained from the pulp capillary only. A special importance is attached to keeping to exact methodical prescriptions.\n",
      "[The cathode bound group antigen of dysentery-provoking escherichieae (author's transl)]. Antigens from disrupted cells of dysentery-provoking and of non-enteropathogenic Escherichieae were submitted to immunoelectrophoresis on cellulose acetate stripes at pH 8.0. Among 6 immune sera produced for this purpose by immunizing rabbits against desintegrated dysentery bacteria, only one contained a precipitine reacting with an antigen similar to the \"generic antigen\" of BELAYA. This - at pH 8.0 - cathode-bound group antigen (KGA) could not only be found in virulent but also in 5 attenuated cultures and in 5 from 6 avirulent strains of several dysentery types. Only the - apathogenic - type culture 1111/55 of dysentery-provoking E. coli O 136 showed no KGA-reaction. Some sources of methodical errors responsible for false outcomes of immunopherogrammes have been discussed.\n",
      "[Isolation of the individual structural elements of bacteria of the genus Bordetella and a study of their properties. I. The formation of mureinoplasts and true protoplasts from B. pertussis]. B. pertussis suspension was tested by De Voe et al. method (1970) and its modification with the solutions of a definite ionic composition and a lysozyme. The best results were obtained by the following modification elaborated by the authors. The microbes were grown on the casein-carbon agar for 36 hours and were washed with chilled 0.5 M NaCl. The suspension was washed 4 times with the same solution and then the precipitate was suspended in saccharose solution (0.5 M). In 2 hours the saccharose was replaced by a solution of salts with lysozyme. After a 2-hour incubation at 35 degrees C the substance was centrifugated for 20 minutes and the precipitate suspended in the tris-buffer at pH 7.8. The following changes were observed: after the washing and incubation with saccharose there was seen a strong stretching and separation of the cell wall (CW) from the cytoplasmic membrane (CPM); cells without the CW were rarely revealed; 2) after the lysozyme treatment there were many cells of spherical shape (phasic-contrast microscopy) without any CW, limited by the CPM only. Morphologically they were no different from the true protoplasts of the Gram-positive bacteria. The chemical analysis also confirmed a possibility of obtaining the true protoplasts of the Gram-negative bacteria.\n",
      "[Sympathico-adrenal system activity in a primary immune response]. Experiments were carried out on linear mice immunized with sheep erythrocytes; it was found that the primary immune respose developed against the background of significant changes in the state of the sympathico-adrenal system, whose activity was determined by the dynamics of catecholamines in the blood and in the tissues of a number of organs, including the thymus, the spleen and the lymph nodes. By comparing the value of specific and neurohumoral indices it was revealed that the neurohumoral shifts preceded the maximal development of the immune response. On the example of studying the catecholamine dynamics the opinion on a close association between the state of the regulatory mechanisms and the effector formations responsible for the formation of specific immunological reactions was confirmed. It is suggested that a full-value immunological response developed on condition of activation of the sympathico-adrenal system.\n",
      "[Covalent binding of peroxidase to CH- and AH-Sepharose 4 B]. The properties of peroxidase insolubilized by covalent binding to CH- and AH-Sepharose 4 B in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) are described. CH-Sepharose 4 B bound peroxidase yields an enzyme preparation with a residual specific activity of 60.6%. When bound to AH-Sepharose 4 B, the residual specific activity is to 78%. The reasons of these differences in the catalytic activity of the two insolubilized enzyme preparations are discussed. By covalent binding on CH- and AH-Sepharose 4 B, peroxidase exibits no changes in its pH optimum; it virtually keeps the same activity after being used ten times. Insolubilized peroxidase preparations, dried and reimbibed after being stored for 6 weeks at room temperature still display 50% of the initial specific activity of the insolubilized enzyme. Stored in acetate buffer, the enzyme preparations maintain their activity during all this interval.\n",
      "Aerobacter aerogenes PRL-R3 urease. Purification and properties. A method for the preparation of a 150-fold purified and homogenous A. aerogenes urease is reported. The enzyme exhibited two pH optima at pH 7.0 and 7.5 in triethanolamine and phosphate buffer, respectively. The affinity of the enzyme toward its substrate increased with the increase of pH. No effect of the pH was observed on the measured temperature coefficient (Q10). There was no discontinuity in the Arrhenius plots at pH 5.4 and 7.5 but an upward discontinuity at pH 6.15 and 8.7 with transition temperature at 30 degrees C. Also, the calculated activation energies are greatly affected by the pH of the enzyme reaction mixture.\n",
      "Further characterization of the association of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with reticulocyte membranes. 1. The behaviour and properties of membrane-bound GAPDH of rabbit reticulocytes were investigated. 2. The bound GAPDH is more resistant to inactivation by KCl than the soluble enzyme (allotopy). 3. The bound enzyme is released by electrolytes. This effect does not only depend on the ionic strength but additionally on the kind of ions, pH-value and protein concentration. 4. A comparison of the releasing effect of NAD analogues shows the necessity of the 5'-AMP moiety in the structure of the effector. 5. The represented results demonstrate the specifity of the GAPDH-membrane binding in rabbit reticulocytes.\n",
      "[Effect of the vagus nerve on isolated rabbit atria in ganglionic blockade due to hexamethonium]. By quantitative stimulation of the vagus nerves of isolated rabbit atria frequency-response relations were obtained for both the electrotropic effect (reduction of the area of the monophasic action potential) and the inotropic response. An addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10(-5) g/ml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation, and was connected with a shift of the frequency-response characteristic to the right. At higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible. By raising the concentration up to 4-10(-5) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent, and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies. In the range of 20 sec(-1) to 100 sec(-1) this dependence was re-established and may be considered as a part of a normal frequency-response relation extremely shifted to the right. The time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period. A mathematical handling of the frequency-response characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres.\n",
      "Chemical relaxation studies on the system liver alcohol dehydrogenase, NADH and imidazole. Several years ago, Theorell and Czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole, using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence. These early experiments were repeated with improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in general terms. However, the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around 3 ms. Furthermore, the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier (by factor 2). The data were evaluated much more rigorously than before, allowing an appropriate interpretation of the results. The observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes, which are faster than three (of the four) dissociation rate constants, determined previously by Theorell and McKinley-McKee.1,2 This fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence. However, the binding of imidazole to the binary enzyme-coenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes. The observed signal derives largely from the ternary complex(es). A substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed relaxation process, suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in reference to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme. Nine models are considered with two types of coupling of pre-equilibria (none-all). Quantitative evaluations favor the model with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the four-step (bimolecular) cycle. The ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside. The interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole. If it would be shifted very much to the side of the \"dead-end\" complex (as in isobutyramide?!), stimulating action could not take place.\n",

The author shows complex analyses: clinical, laboratory, X-rays, bronchoscopical, bronchographical and measuring lung function tests as well as the serological examinations in blood serum of both groups of asthmatic and nonasthmatic children with virological infection. The calculation of statistically significant differences between the various diagnostical results of both groups has confirmed that in asthmatic children virological infection of the respiratory tract, pathological findings in X-ray and lung function tests, bronchiectasis and secondary bacteriological invasion occurs statistically significantly more often than in nonasthmatic children.\n",
      "Multiple forms of staphylococcal alpha-toxin. A group of proteins was readily extracted at neutrality from trichloroacetic acid precipitates of staphylococcal culture filtrate supernatants, while alpha-toxin was dissolved and activated by treating the precipitate with 8 M urea, with acidic buffers or by heating to 90-100 degrees C at neutrality. Heat activation of the precipitate produced a relatively pure alpha-toxin with a molecular weight of 39,000. alpha-Toxin was eluted together with three other proteins on hydroxyl apatite chromatography, and evidence was obtained for an association between the four proteins. On isoelectric focusing a haemolytic fraction was obtained at pH 6.2, probably due to acid activation of the precipitate formed at the cathodic end of the column. The alpha-haemolytic fractions with pI's of 7.4 and 8.6 were shown to consist of alpha-toxin only when analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. The haemolytic component with a pI of 9.2 contained two additional components of molecular weights of 27,500 and 18,000. Chromatography of this material on Sephadex G-200 showed that alpha-toxin and the two proteins appeared as a high molecular complex.\n",
      "Acute otitis media. A clinical bacteriological and serological study of children with frequent episodes of acute otitis media. A series of episodes of acute otitis media was studied with reference to bacterial findings and specific serological responses in 48 children with histories of frequent episodes before. D. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Re-isolations after therapy were often made in episodes with slow healing or therapeutic failure. Most children harboured pathogens in nasopharynx even when they had no signs of respiratory tract infections. Homologous relapses were seen only in few cases and never with pneumococcus type 3 and only once with H. influenzae type b. Specific serological responses were demonstrable generally in children over 2 years of age. D. pneumococcus type 3 and H. influenzae type b generally provoked antibody response. No levels indicating immunoglobulin deficiencies could be found in the children.\n",
      "Endosymbiosis and cellular tolerance in the Hawaiian soft coral Sarcothelia edmondsoni verrill. The relationship between the soft coral Sarcothelia edmondsoni Verrill and its symbiotic algae is considered as an early instance of cellular tolerance which can be disturbed by a variety of adverse conditions. The algal cells lie in vesicles deep within the endodermal cells of the host and are not subject to digestion. Their expulsion appears to be a reverse translocation to the distal end of the host cell and escape by a form of reversed phagocytosis resembling secretion. The cellular mechanisms involved are not clear.\n",
      "Epidemiologic investigations of the 1969 epidemic of Venezuelan encephalitis in Ecuador. An epizoodemic of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), subtype I variant B, occurred in Ecuador during the rainy and hot season of 1969. In this paper, a general description of the epidemic is given and virus isolations from humans are reported. A serologic survey was performed in order to determine the extension of the epidemic along the coastal zone of the country. It is not clear whether the higher antibody rate in older people was because they were at greater risk of infection or was the result of an accumulated immunity with time. The latter could be an indication of endemic virus activity, not yet proven for the VEE IB virus variant. Mosquito surveillance and attempted control by aerial spraying were carried out.\n",
      "Congenital malformations of the central nervous system produced by narcotic analgesics in the hamster. Maternal dose--fetal teratogenic response data were obtained for a variety of narcotic and related compounds by single subcutaneous injections of the drugs into pregnant hamsters during the critical periods of central nervous system organogenesis. The number of abnormal fetuses from females injected with diacetylmorphine (heroin), thebaine, phenazocine, pentazocine, propoxyphene, and methadone increased as the maternal dose of the compounds was increased. By contrast, morphine, hydromorphone, and meperidine produced an increase in the number (per cent) of fetal anomalies only up to a certain maternal dose level. Further increases in maternal dose levels did not produce additional fetal anomalies. Comparative studies of single and multiple maternal doses indicated that diacetylmorphine (heroin) and methadone produced a four- to sixfold increase in fetal anomalies with repetitive doses whereas the percentage of malformed fetuses remained the same with hydromorphone (Dilaudid). The narcotic antagonists nalorphine, naloxone, levallophan, and cyclazocine blocked the teratogenic effects of both single and multiple doses of the narcotics.\n",

      "Ionic requirements of proximal tubular sodium transport. II. Hydrogen ion. Simultaneous perfusion to proximal convoluted tubules and peritubular capillaries was used to study the effects of different perfusion fluids on sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, which was calculated as bicarbonate reabsorption and titratable acid. Results show that sodium reabsorption was not tightly coupled to hydrogen secretion. Bicarbonate stimulates both sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, but Tris stimulates only sodium reabsorption. Imposing an adverse chloride gradient across the proximal tubule (C1- peritubular greater than C1- luminal) decreased sodium reabsorption but did not diminish hydrogen secretion. Diamox inhibited both net sodium and hydrogen transport. It is concluded that there is not firm linkage between sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion and that bicarbonate probably stimulates sodium transport by a number of mechanisms, including an effect on the sodium transport unrelated to its ability to increase hydrogen ion secretion.\n",
      "ECS, intracellular pH, and electrolytes of cardiac and skeletal muscle. The extracellular space (ECS) of muscle from each ventricle of the heart (RV and LV), the atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps was estimated in the anesthetized rabbit from the distribution volumes of [14C]insulin, [14C]sucrose, [51Cr]EDTA, and C1--. Whole-tissue electrolytes were measured and intracellular electrolytes calculated. The ECS of the tissues varied, increasing in the order quadriceps less than LV less than RV less than atria. The volume of distribution of [14C]inulin was always less than that of either [14C]sucrose or [51Cr]EDTA which agreed closely, whereas that of C1-- was always greater. There was no difference in intracellular K+ in muscle from each of the cardiac chambers, whereas intracellular Na+ and C1-- varied, increasing in the order quadriceps less than LV less than RV less than atria. Intracellular pH, measured with [14C]DMO did not differ in any of the tissues studied. It is concluded that, in vivo, the estimated ECS incardiac muscle is lower than that reported in vitro, that [51Cr]EDTA is a satisfactory ECS marker, and that differences in intracellular Na+ and C1-- but not K+ or pH exist between muscle from the cardiac chambers.\n",
      "Intracellular pH and K+ of cardiac and skeletal muscle in acidosis and alkalosis. The effects of a metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis on intracellular pH (pHi) and K+ have been compared in cardiac and skeletal muscle from the anesthetized rabbit. The extracellular space and pHi were calculated from the distribution volumes of [51Cr] EDTA and [14C]DMO, respectively. When pHe was varied by altering PCO2, the slope of the line relating pHi to the extracellular pH (pHe) was greater (P less than 0.05--0.001) than that obtained during metabolic changes of pHe in right and left ventricles, atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps. During metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, the slope of pHi/pHe line did not vary between tissues. During respiratory acidosis, there was no difference in slope between cardiac tissues, but it was less in left ventricle than quadriceps (P less than 0.001). In left ventricle intracellular K+ increased in a metabolic (P less than 0.05) or respiratory acidosis (P less than 0.02), whereas in diaphragm it decreased (P less than 0.02). Intracellular K+ correlated with pHe and pHE-PHi. Changes in pHi but not intracellular K+ could explain known differences in myocardial function in respiratory and metabolic acidosis.\n",
      "Effects of autonomic neurohumors on transmembrane potentials of atrial plateau fibers. Isolated canine atrial plateau fibers were treated with acetylcholine or norepinephrine to note the effects on the transmembrane potential. Acetylcholine, 1.0 or 2.0 mug/ml, consistently reduced the slope of inherent phase 4 depolarization. Increases in maximum diastolic potential and rising velocity occurred along with a decrease in overshoot. The plateau phase disappeared. Pretreatment with atropine, 1.0 mug/ml, prevented these responses, and alone this drug had no discernible effect. Norepinephrine consistently increased the slope of phase 4 depolarization. Frequently plateau fibers generated action potentials by the normal pacemaker mechanism. \"Arrhythmias\" characterized by spontaneous excitations were induced in 92% of the norepinephrine experiments. Norepinephrine also enhanced the plateau phase of the action potential and decreased the rising velocity and overshoot. Racemic propranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, blocked all the above effects including arrhythmias. Dextropropranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, did not block effects produced by norepinephrine. Acetylcholine, applied to fibers under treatment with norepinephrine, reduced the slope of norepinephrine-induced phase 4 depolarization and terminated induced arrhythmias.\n",
      "Interstitial fluid pressure and alkaline gastric secretion. The interstitial fluid pressure of the submucosa of the gastric fundus was monitored by means of Guyton's capsules in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. The intracapsular pressure (ICP) was measured during secretion produced by: a) hypertonic solutions placed inside the stomach; b) arterial hypertension (200 mmHg) applied during intra-arterial infusion of histamine, and c) intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine. The first procedure did not modify the ICP. On the other hand, whenever interstitial fluid appeared in the gastric lumen during hypertension plus histamine, the mean ICP increased, mostly due to augmented capillary filtration. The hydraulic coefficient measured in these experiments was at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than the respective osmotic coefficient. The action of acetylcholine was complex: large doses enlarged the net capillary filtration, but small doses increased the mean ICP by muscle stimulation only. Contraction of the muscularis mucosae might be the most important mechanism underlying bulk flow of interstitial fluid in physiological conditions. It is concluded that hydraulic gradients across the epithelium might account for the \"secretion\" of \"alkaline\" juice.\n",
      "Overview: maintenance therapy in psychiatry: I. Schizophrenia. Hospital psychiatry has evolved from long-term \"treatment\" programs that were primarily custodial to the successful pharmacological treatment of acute psychotic episodes. Unfortunately, many patients still return to the hospital with relapses. This so-called revolving door syndrome draws attention to the critical importance of preventing as well as treating acute episodes. In the first part of this overview, the author reviews the clinical literature on prophylactic treatment of schizophrenia with maintenance antipsychotic drugs. The second part will review the literature on prophylactic treatment of affective disorders with lithium and tricyclics. In the opinion of the author these drugs provide the potential for truly preventive psychiatry.\n",
      "Inpatient and outpatient patterns of psychotropic drug prescribing by nonpsychiatrist physicians. The authors found that among 228 general hospital patients, minor tranquilizers were prescribed most often and with the least justification and that major tranquilizers were prescribed sparingly and by and large judiciously. Antidepressants were given less often than would be justified by the incidence of depressive illness among these patients. Nonrecognition of depression in patients with somatic complaints and autonomic signs of depression contributed to this lack of treatment.\n",

      "Protective effect of hypothermia in cerebral oxygen deficiency caused by arterial hypoxia. To study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia, anesthetized (70% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body temperature of 27 C. Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced mean PaO2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively. At PaO2 torr, there was no change in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrla oxygen consumption (CMRO2), or labile tissue metabolites. The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and pH on the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Thus, at 27 C with a PaO2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content (TO2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times the value obtained at this PO2 in normothermic rats. At PaO2 11-12 torr, arterial TO2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced no change in CMRO2, a threefold increase in CBF, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in ATP, ADP, or AMP. These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial TO2 in normothermic rats. It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are involved. First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it maintains a high TO2 in arterial blood at a given PaO2. Second, by reducing CMRO2, and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level.\n",
      "Characterization of a caprine herpesvirus. A virus, which was isolated from kids (Capra hircus) affected with a relatively severe generalized infection, was found to contain DNA and to have a buoyant density of 1.2820 g/cm3. The virus was sensitive to the action of lipid solvents and trypsin and was rapidly inactivated at pH 3.0 and at temperatures of 50 and 56 C. The virion, an icosahedron consisting of a nucleoid surrounded by a double membrane, measured approximately 135 nm in diameter. On the basis of its chemical and physical properties, the virus is considered a herpesvirus.\n",
      "Transfer of drugs across the ruminal wall in goats. The rates at which pentobarbital, salicylate, antipyrine, and quinine were transferred from the rumen of intact, conscious goats were measured. The rates at which the same drugs diffused from the blood plasma (under conditions of constant drug concentration) into the ruminal solution were also evaluated. These compounds were absorbed by simple diffusion, and the rates of transfer were a function of pH of the intraruminal solution. The diffusion of drugs from plasma into the reticulorumen allowed steady-state distributions to be established in some goats. The theoretical and observed steady-state distributions were compared. There were good correlations for pentobarbital and antipyrine, but not for salicylate and quinine. These findings confirm in vivo the general principles of drug transfer across ruminal epithelium that were derived from previous studies conducted in vitro.\n",
      "Preservation of hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in canine pneumococcal pneumonia. To determine the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pneumococcal pneumonia, hemodynamic measurements were made in 16 dogs before, and within 36 hours after, intrapulmonary administration of type III pneumococcus. Ten dogs with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary vascular resistances and slightly decreased their arterial O2 tensions. Hypoxia increased and hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances. During O2 breathing, arterial PO2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung. In 2 dogs breathing air, forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by O2 breathing. In 5 dogs, lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia. In pneumococcal pneumonia, the hypoxic pulmonary pressor mechanism serves to decrease blood flow to the diseased lobes and, thus, to maintain the arterial PO2. Lung mast cells could participate in this response.\n",
      "Value of capillary blood gas analyses in the management of acute respiratory distress. A comparative study of blood gases and acid-base parameters, obtained simultaneously from arterial and finger capillary samples, was performed in 45 patients in acute respiratory distress without circulatory shock. Although small and significant differences were found between the 2 sample pH, Po2, Pco2, and bicarbonate values, the correlations between the 2 were greater than or equal to 0.97 for each variable. It was concluded that although the arterial blood is the preferred sample for evaluation of blood gases and acid-base status of patients in acute respiratory distress, capillary blood appears to be a valid substitute in the management of these patients. This technique is particularly valuable in pediatric practice, where repeated arterial samples are less easily obtained.\n",

      "The virus hypothesis in systemic lupus erythematosus. Type-C viruses are currently the prime etiologic candidates in systemic lupus erythematosus. On the basis of knowledge gained from studies of experimental and human models of chronic viral disease, there are possible pathogenetic roles of a virus in systemic lupus erythematosus. Experimental attempts at implicating specific viruses have been predominantly negative, but evidence for enhanced type-C-virus expression has recently been reported.\n",
      "The membrane transport of ascorbic acid. A system for measuring the rate of transport of dehydroascorbate into human red blood cells shows Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with substrate inhibition at levels above 150 muM DHA. The addition of sugars impairs this transport in the diminishing hierarchy D-glucose, D-mannose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-lyxose, D-araboascorbate, L-sorbose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose. The effect of glucose on transport of ascorbate is marked at physiological levels. Transport of DHA is accelerated by copper ion and allows dehydroascorbate to move against a concentration gradient. The evidence supports the hypotheses proposing that hyperglycemia will impair the intracellular availability of vitamin C.\n",
      "Carcinofetal alterations in glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase. The levels of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase in various rat tissues including those undergoing differentiation or regeneration revealed that the enzyme is related to tissue proliferation and differentiation. In the liver upon neoplastic transformation, the level of glucosamine 6-phosphate synthetase rises and the liver form of the enzyme having a pI at 5.0 is replaced by a form with a pI of 4.1. Since the latter form has also been found present in whole embryos (12- and 14-day) and brain, the molecular alterations of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthetase in liver neoplasia can be considered to be carcinofetal.\n",
      "A hepatoma-associated alkaline phosphatase, the Kasahara isozyme, compared with one of the isozymes of FL amnion cells. It was found that a human hepatoma-associated ALP (orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, E.C. 3.1.3.1) shared electrophoretic mobility, inactivation by urea, inhibition by inorganic phosphate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and amino acids (L-phenylalanine, L-leucine and L-homoarginine), heat stability, sensitivity to neuraminidase, pH optimum, Km value, and antigen site with fast moving ALP isozymes of FL cell strain derived from human amniotic membrane. However, 40-week-old fresh amniotic membrane lacked this isozyme. Instead, it had a placental type ALP consisting of minor components. The other ALP isozyme of FL cells had properties common to hepatoma ALP with regard to L-phenylalanine sensitivity, inhibition by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, inactivation by urea, and antigen site, but differed from it in electrophoretic mobility, sensitivity to L-leucine and L-homoarginine, and the presence of another antigen site. It was more heat stable and more sensitive to inhibition by inorganic phosphate than Hepatoma AP. The possible regulatory mechanism between the hepatoma-type ALP and the placental type ALP in the amnion cells is considered.\n",
      "Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. A sensitive indicator  of renal ischaemic injury in experimental animals and renal homograft rejection in man. The sites of ischaemic injury within the kidney are reviewed and the diagnostic value of measurements of plasma and urinary enzymes in renal ischaemic injury and in renal homotransplant rejection in experimental animals and man is examined. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) is an enzyme primarily located in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Its unique localization in the cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay provide the rationale for its use in the measurement and diagnosis of renal ischaemic injury. gamma-GT activity was measured in dogs undergoing varying periods of renal ischaemia and under conditions of local renal hypothermia and was shown to be a sensitive indicator of ischaemic injury. Twenty consecutive patients undergoing renal homotransplantation were studied by daily estimation of their 24-h urinary gamma-GT activity; excellent correlation was obtained between raised levels of this enzyme and the clinical diagnosis of transplant rejection.\n",
      "Influence of pH on the heat inactivation of staphylococcal enterotoxin A as determined by monkey feeding and serological assay. The effect of pH on the thermal inactivation of staphylococcal enterotoxin A was investigated. Analysis of heated toxin by immunodiffusion in gel indicated that enterotoxin A in beef bouillon was inactivated faster at pH 5.3 than at pH 6.2. The z values (slopes) for the heat inactivation curves at pH 6.2 and 5.3 were 49.5 and 55 F (about 27 and 30 C), respectively. Enterotoxin produced and heated in dialyzed Casamino Acids medium and assayed by monkey feeding was more easily inactivated by heat at pH 5.3 than at pH 7.8. Thermal inactivation curves for enterotoxin A in beef bouillon (5 mug/ml, pH 5.3) were determined by two methods, monkey feeding and serological assay. The z values for the curves obtained by these two methods were both 55 F, although loss of biological or toxic activity of the enterotoxin occurred before loss of serological activity.\n",
      "Survival of salmonellae during pepperoni manufacture. Survival of salmonellae in artificially contaminated beef-pork mixtures (approximately 10(4) salmonellae/g) was studied in pepperoni prepared by either a natural flora or lactic starter culture fermentation or in nonfermented sausages. The pepperoni did not become salmonellae free during the usual commercial 15 to 30-day drying period. Salmonella dublin was present in all products, fermented or unfermented, after 42 to 43 days of drying. At a lower level of contamination, 10(3)/g, S. dublin could not be recovered from starter culture-fermented pepperoni after 14 days of drying but persisted in the natural flora-fermented sausage. S. typhimurium (initial count, 10(4)/g) was absent after 42 days of drying when starter culture was used to ferment the pepperoni, but was still present in the natural flora-fermented and unfermented products. S. dublin, host adapted to cattle, or S. choleraesuis, host adapted to swine, had similar  survival patterns in beef pork, or beef-pork pepperoni. Heating salmonellae contaminated beef-pork pepperoni (after fermantation but before drying) to an internal temperature of 60 C (trichinae inactivating) eliminated the food-borne pathogen from the sausage product.\n",
      "Growth of Staphylococcus and Salmonella on frankfurters with and without sodium nitrite. Conventional and nitrite-free frankfurters in loosely wrapped packages were compared as to their ability to support growth of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and their naturally occurring spoilage flora at 7 C (simulating refrigerated  storage) and 20 C (simulating possible temperature abuse). At 7 C Salmonella did not grow in either type of frankfurter; Staphylococcus and the natural spoilage flora sometimes grew more rapidly in the absence of nitrite, but the difference was not significant. At 20 C growth of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and of the spoilage flora was, at most, only slightly faster on nitrite-free frankfurters. Salmonella was not suppressed in broth culture experiments the pH and nitrite content found in frankfurters. Although either type of frankfurter can become hazardous due to growth of Salmonella or Staphylococcus, no unusual or additional hazard resulted from the omission of nitrite from frankfurters.\n",
      "Characterization of an extracellular dextranase from Fusarium moniliforme. An extracellular dextranase (EC 3.2.1.11) was purified approximately 75-fold from cell-free culture filtrates of Fusarium moniliforme. The purified dextranase was of the endo type, and isomaltose was identified as the primary end product of dextran hydrolysis. The molecular weight of the dextranase was determined to be 39,000 by gel permeation chromatography. The enzyme was most active at pH 5.5, and the temperature optimum was near 55 C. Activity was not inhibited by either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or iodoacetate. The Km for dextran with an average molecular weight of 10,000 was estimated to be 1.1 X 10(-4) M. The electrophoretic mobility of the dextranase was distinctly different from that of a Penicillium-derived commercial dextranase. The F. moniliforme dextranase was also found to differ from the commercial preparation by its greater relative activity against glucans isolated from Streptococcus mutans.\n",

      "Graft versus host reaction. An ultrastructural study. Graft versus host reaction (GvH) following leukocytic transfusions occurred in a 34-year-old man with a generalized lymphosarcoma. Histologic and ultrastructural studies were performed, with special reference to dyskeratotic cells scattered in the epidermis. These cells are usually considered to be a constant and important feature of GvH reaction. Dense aggregation of tonofilaments, including cytoplasmic organelles and loss of desmosomes, were seen in dyskeratotic cells. Several intracellular desmosomes with tonofilaments bound to their attachment plaque were observed. Some of these cells were able to reach the horny layer; some others were phagocytosed by neighboring keratinocytes. These cells could be the result of a toxic damage to the epidermis, provoked by the immunologic phenomenon implicated in GvH reaction. Later in the clinical course, bullae formations occurred, showing some features of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), as well as features of GvH reaction.\n",
      "Nephrotic syndrome in indian children. A clinicopathological study of 206 Indian children with nephrotic syndrome showed a primary renal cause in 195 (96%), of which 77% were boys. In 126 children (96 boys, 30 girls) onset of the disorder occurred before the age of 5 years. Renal biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients (77%); in 85 of these biopsy was done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome. Significant renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as mesangiocapillary 8, mesangioproliferative 4, proliferative with extensive crescents 2, membranous 3, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9, focal global glomerulosclerosis 2, advanced nonspecific 8, and mild proliferative 9. Nephritic manifestations were mainly associated with significant renal lesions, which were more frequently encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years. Clearance of proteinuria with corticosteroid therapy was practically confined to patients with minimal or mild renal histological changes. Our findings suggest that the pattern of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in Indian children is similar to that reported from Western countries.\n",
      "Separation of deoxyribonucleases (DNases) of normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales by micro-disc-electrophoresis. Normal stratum corneum and psoriatic scales were homogenized and a differential centrifugation was performed. The DNase activity of the individual fractions was investigated by micro-dis-electrophoresis. At pH 5 only in the 600xg pellet and 105.000xg supernatant of normal keratin DNase activity could be observed. However, all psoriatic fractions showed distinct enzyme activities. At pH 7.4 little psoriatic DNase activity could only be demonstrated in the 105.000xg supernatant. Except from the 15.000xg pellet all fractions of normal stratum corneum displayed marked activities. In addition the 105.000xg supernatant showed two different DNase bands.\n",
      "Subcellular distribution of phosphatases, proteinases, and ribonucleases in normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales. The subcellular distribution of phosphatases, proteinases, and ribonucleases of normal human stratum corneum and psoriatic scales was determined after differential centrifugation. All psoriatic enzymes showed much increased activities as compared to the normal stratum corneum enzymes. The highest activities of alkaline phosphatase from psoriatic scales could be detected in the nuclear fraction. The main activities of all other tested phosphatases and proteinases were present in the cytoplasmatic fraction. The subcellular distribution of the ribonucleases varied according to the pH value.\n",
      "A reinvestigation of the sites of transcription and translation of Euglena chloroplastic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. An attempt was made to determine the sites of chloroplast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase transcription and translation. Inhibitors of bacterial RNA and protein synthesis were added to logarithmic and stationary phase cultures of Euglena gracilis wild-type B. Logarithmic phase cultures were sensitive to both types of inhibitors. In stationary phase cultures plastid synthetase was reduced by RNA but not by protein synthesis inhibitors. The effect of the antibiotics on the mitochondrial enzyme was also noted. Several possible explanations of these resuults are discussed.\n",
      "[Hyperthermia in the rabbit. II. Studies on influencing respiration with exogenic hyperthermia]. Rectal temperature, respiratory rate, arterial and venous pH and arterial and venous pCO2 were recorded at intervals of 15-30 minutes in female broiler rabbits exposed an environmental temperature of 35 degrees C, until they died. Respiratory rate and blood pH rose, and pCO2 fell, until a rectal temperature of 42 degrees C was reached. Upon further increase in rectal temperature the respiratory rate and pH began to fall, while pCO2 began to rise. The rabbits died when rectal temperature reached 43 degrees C. Features of respiratory function peculiar to the rabbit were discussed.\n",
      "Outpatient phenothiazine use and bone marrow depression. A report from the drug epidemiology unit and the Boston collaborative drug surveillance program. Phenothiazine-induced bone marrow depression (BMD) was evaluated in three separate but complementary data bases: (1) Among 1,048 patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals, there was no evidence of subclinical depression of the white blood cell (WBC) count attributable to phenothiazines used before admission. (2) Among 18,587 medical inpatients, there were 34 patients admitted for BMD in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy; one of the latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride, but it is doubtful whether this drug was the cause of the BMD. (3) Among 24,795 medical, surgical, and gynecological patients surveyed over a ten-month period in 1972, there were four who were admitted for BMD; one of the latter had a reversible leukopenia attributed to trifluoperazine hydrochloride.\n",
      "[Tumour hyperacidulation through intravenous glucose infusion enhanced by amygdalin and beta-glucosidase application (author's transl)]. Tumour peracidity in otherwise moderately hyperacidulated tumours or tumour regions of DS carcinosarcoma-bearing Wistar rats attained by glucose infusion was substantially increased by simultaneous infusion of amygdalin and intratumoral i.m. or i.v. application of beta-glucosidase. Here the pH value of healthy tissue, measured at the sceletal muscle, remained unchanged. By means of the said process, tumour hyperacidulation has been raised to a level of deltapH =0.97; attaining a pH difference between tumourous and normal tissue of up to deltapH = 1.6. In one case, the slope of pH reduction in the tumour increased to 870%. Moreover, combined administration of glucose, amygdalin and beta-glucosidase evoked a significant cancerostatic effect hypogenesis, tumour regression) being comparable with the action of an Ifosfamid dosage of 150 mg-kg-1. However, i.m. and i.v. application of beta-glucosidase under narcosis results in an overall process that still remains somewhat too toxic. Hence optimizing studies are intended with the particular aim to further improve the comparability of this process.\n",
      "Studies of the pain produced by mafenide acetate preparations in burns. In a double-blind triple cross-over clinical study, 37 patients were exposed to several formulations of mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon Cream) and their pain responses were recorded and converted to a semiquantitative pain index. The 11.2% concentration in cream was two to three times more painful than the 5% concentration. Hypertonicity  and not the pH level appears to be the cause of the pain produced by the high (11.2%) concentration. The tonicity of the cream carrier and 11.2% mafenide acetate are 1,080 mOsm/kg and 1,100 mOsm/kg, respectively, for a total of 2,180 mOsm/kg. The carrier cream without glycerol and a 5% concentration of mafenide cream were much less painful than the 11.2% concentration of mafenide. Both afforded a great deal of relief to the patients who received the medications.\n",
      "Microbiol growth in lipid emulsions used in parenteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition via central venous catheterization is associated with serious risks, especially that of sepsis. Lipid emulsion (Intralipid[Sweden]), which may be administered peripherally, was evaluated for its potential to support microbial growth. Washed cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and three species of Gram-negative rods were all capable of multiplying in the emulsion at room temperature. Variations in inoculum size did not affect the growth rate. Studies comparing the emulsion to amino acid-glucose solutions (total parenteral nutrition [TPN])confirmed other reports that TPN inhibits the growth of certain bacteria but merely retards fungal multiplication. When human serum was added to the lipid emulsion in an attempt to simulate in vivo conditions at the catheter tip, Escherichia coli was inhibited while the growth of S aureus and C albicians was unaltered.\n",
      "Propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene tissue concentrations in fatalities associated with propoxyphene hydrochloride and propoxyphene napsylate. Propoxyphene and its major metabolite norpropoxyphene have been determined in blood and liver in 29 cases of death in which propoxyphene, either as the hydrochloride or as the napsylate salt, was involved. The use of propoxyphene napsylate (Darvon-N) contributed to the deaths of 4 persons, 3 of whom were former heroin addicts receiving large amounts of this drug in connection with propoxyphene substitution programs. In the majority of cases the norpropoxyphene blood concentrations exceed the propoxyphene concentrations, although brain determinations in several instances indicate that norpropoxyphene does not cross the blood-brain barrier with the same ease as propoxyphene. On the basis of the comparative toxicities of propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene in animals and the high tissue concentrations of norporpoxyphene in man after propoxyphene administration, it is conceivable that norpropoxyphene contributes to the toxic effects of propoxyphene.\n",
      "[Morphological manifestations and morphogenesis of the graft vs. host reaction in the brain of F1 hybrids following the administration of parental lymphoid cells and its effect on tumor inoculation]. It was established that intracerebral introduction of 10 min parental cells of the spleen brought about in hybrids (CBAXC57Bl/6) F1 infiltrative-destructive changes (development of lymphocytic infiltrations, dystrophy in the nerve cells, myelin fibres and neurogliacytes) the intensity of which was found to be considerably higher in cases of injection of parental spleen cells from specifically sensitized donors. Spleen cells of mice CBA produced much greater changes as compared with those produced by spleen cells of mice C57Bl/6. Inoculation into the mice brain of 10 mln of spleen cells together with tumour in a dose of 1500 cells produced a clear cut inhibitory effect on the tumour growth, this effect being more pronounced following introduction of sensitized cells of the spleen of mice CBA.\n",
      "Metachromatic leukodystrophy. Ultrastructural and enzymatic study of a case of variant O form. A variant of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Austin disease, is characterized by a multiple isozyme deficiency of arylsulfatase. A 3 1/2-year-old girl with progressive mental and physical deterioration had decreased activities of arylsulfatases A and B in the leukocytes, shown by acylamide gel electrophoresis. Under the electron microscope, biopsy specimens of the brain and the peripheral nerve showed lamellar structures with socalled zebra bodies in the cytoplasmic processes of glial cells, granulo-membranous inclusions with fingerprint configurations in neurons, and myelinlike material in Schwann cells. Results from our study suggest an intricate nature of this dysmetabolic disorder, which shows ultrastructural changes usually seen in classic MLD, a deficiency of arylsulfatase A only, concomitant with those seen in mucopolysaccharidoses such as Hurler and Sanfilippo syndromes.\n",
      "Changes in the acid base status of sheep anaesthetised with a combination of atropine sulphate acepromazine and ketamine hydrochloride. pH, PaCO2, PaO2, standard bicarbonate, base excess and reduced pH were measured in sheep before and at regular intervals after administration of ketamine with and without atropine and acepromazine premedication. A decrease in pH and PaO2 and a rise in PaCO2 was observed 15 minutes after administration of ketamine. Administration of atropine with and without acepromazine had no significant effect on pH, PaCO2 and PaO2. The values for standard bicarbonate, base excess and reduced pH were not significantly affected. This indicates that minor changes observed in pH, PaCO2 after ketamine administration are compensated for by the healthy animal's blood buffer system.\n",
      "Molecular nature of beta-galactosidase from different tissues in two strains of the house mouse. One inbred mouse strain, C57BL/Kl, has high galactosidase activities in all tissues while another strain, DBA/2/Kl, has low activities determined by the Bgs locus. Beta-Galactosidase from these two strains was partly purified by a five-step procedure: acidification, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration at two pHs, and isoelectric focusing. No qualitative differences were found between the enzyme preparations from the two strains. They had identical heat inactivation curves, pH optima, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, and the Km values were very similar. It thus seems that this genetic difference in enzyme activity probably cannot be explained by a variation of the galactosidase-specific activity but rather reflects a difference in number of enzyme molecules. Eight different isoenzymes were separated from liver, kidney, and spleen. Each isoenzyme has a different electrophoretic mobility and there is a stepwise increase in molecular weight from 143,000 to 380,000 beginning with the protein having the lowest isoelectric point. A likely interpretation is that the isoenzymes bind a smaller polypeptide in varying numbers in addition to the enzymatic polypeptide per se.\n",
      "The effects of acute and chronic nicotine hydrogen (+)-tartrate administration and subsequent withdrawal on rat liver tryptophan pyrrolase activity and their comparison with those of morphine, phenobarbitone and ethanol. Acute administration of nicotine hydrogen (+)-tartrate enhances the activity of rat liver tryptophan pyrrolase by a hormonal mechanism. Chronic nicotine treatment inhibits, and subsequent withdrawal enhances, the pyrrolase activity. The inhibition during chronic treatment is not due to a defective apoenzyme synthesis nor a decreased cofactor availability. Regeneration of liver NADP+ in vitro and in vivo reverses the inhibition. Chronic nicotine administration increases the liver NADPH concentration. The above effects of nicotine resemble to a remarkable degree those previously shown for morphine, phenobarbitone and ethanol. All effects are compared, and their possible significance in relation to drug dependence is discussed.\n",
      "Plastid development in primary leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris. Development of plastid adenosine triphosphatase activity during greening. The etioplasts of dark-grown bean leaves showed ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) activity which had a pH optimum of 8.5, was stimulated by dithiothreitol and unaffected by light-triggering. Bean chloroplasts showed a low activity of dark-induced ATPase with a pH optimum of 8.5 and a substantial amount of light-triggered activity with a pH optimum of 8.0. The light-triggered activity depended on dithiothreitol and Mg2+ and was promoted by phenazine methosulphate. Light-triggered ATPase activity was completely inhibited by 20mum-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide. Etioplasts developed light-triggered ATPase activity in response to 30 min illumination of the etiolated leaves. During the 48 h of light-induced greening of dark-grown leaves there was a 70% increase of the chloroplast ATPase activity found after light-triggering and a 30% fall in the dark-induced activity, both expressed on a per leaf basis. As the larger part of these changes occurred during the first 30 min of illumination, it is concluded that most or all of the chloroplast ATPase was present in the etioplast, a conclusion identical with that of Lockshin et al. (1971) for maize. During 48 h of greening there was a tenfold increase in the amount of thylakoid membrane in the leaf together with an 83% fall in the ATPase activity per m2 of thylakoid membrane, measured after light-triggering.\n",
      "Influence of some physical factors on survival of Marek's disease vaccine virus. Cell-associated Marek's disease (MD) vaccine was suspended at dilutions normally used for vaccination in seven commercially available diluents and in tryptose phosphate broth. The stability of diluted vaccines was determined by assay in cell cultures subjected to 0 to 37 C for 0 to 90 minutes. Optimum holding temperatures for MD vaccine virus survival varied with the specific diluents employed. Some diluents afforded greatest survival when dilution was at 0 C and held at 0 C, while others performed best when dilution was at 25 C followed by cooling and holding at 0 C. Diluents which allowed greatest survival when tested at 37 C also performed well under other temperature regimes. Spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate and various buffering compounds were added to commercial diluents used for diluting MD vaccine. Additives producing osmolality of 745 mOsm/kg and higher markedly reduced vaccine virus survival. The adverse effects of high osmotic pressure were accentuated by extended holding time, elevated incubation temperature, and physical manipulations including mechanical mixing or expressing through a syringe and needle. Satisfactory MD vaccine virus survival was afforded by a commercial diluent especially formulated to accommodate the pH osmolality changes produced by adding spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate.\n",
      "Tricarboxylic acid-cycle and related enzymes in restricted facultative methylotrophs. The isolation is described of pure cultures of three non-methane-utilizing methylotrophic bacteria which, together with the previously described Bacillus PM6, have a very limited range of growth substrates; these organisms are designated \"restricted facultative' methylotrophs. Two of these isolates, W6A and W3A1, grow only on glucose out of 50 non-C1 compounds tested, whereas the third isolate S2A1 and Bacillus PM6 grow on betaine, glucose, gluconate, alanine, glutamate, citrate and nutrient agar, but not on any of a further 56 non-C1 compounds. Crude sonic extracts of trimethylamine-grown and glucose-grown W6A and W3A1 isolates, and of trimethylamine-grown C2A1 (an obligate methylotroph) contain (i) no detectable 2-oxogltarate dehydrogenase activity, (ii) very low or zero specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase and (iii) NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. Extracts of trimethylamine-grown PM6 and S2A1 methylotrophs have (i) very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase specific activities, (ii) comparatively high specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase and (iii) NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity but no NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The activities of most of these enzymes are increased during growth on glucose, alanine, glutamate or citrate, but only very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities are present under all growth conditions. The restricted facultative methylotrophs grow on certain non-C1 compounds in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and, in some cases, of other enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; these lesions cannot therefore be the sole cause of obligate methylotrophy.\n",
      "Desaturation of stearic acid by liver and adipose tissue from obese-hyperglycaemic mice (ob/ob). Stearic acid desaturase activity was assayed in preparations from perigenital adipose tissue and liver from lean and genetically obese female mice (ob/ob). The total activity in the perigenital adipose tissue from obese mice was threefold greater than in the tissue from lean mice, but per g of adipose tissue the activity was twofold greater in tissue from lean mice. In liver, the activity in obese mice was elevated at 8 weeks of age, remained elevated up to 24 weeks and then decreased by half at 48 weeks, but at all ages was higher than that in lean mice. The decrease in desaturase activity of liver from obese mice at 48 weeks corresponded to a change in the fatty acid composition of liver lipids toward that found in lean mice. Whereas in adipose tissue much of the increased enzyme activity may be due to tissue hyperplasia, in liver it is mainly an increased activity per cell.\n",
      "The stimulation by synaptic transmitters of the incorporation of oleate into the phospholipid of synaptic membranes. Noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of guinea-pig brain synaptic membranes incubated in sodium phosphate buffer. In the presence of 1 mm-NaF, noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into the choline glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylinositol, ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid of synaptic membranes incubated in 10 mm-Tris-HCl buffer. In Tris-CHl containing 1 mm-NaF, stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by ATP, CaCl2, MgCl2 and CoA plus dithiothreitol. The optimum concentration of CaCl2 for stimulation by 10 mum-noradrenaline was 10 mum. In the presence of CaCl2, the optimum concentration of ATP-2MgCl2 was in the range 0.1-1 mm. Acetylcholine, carbamoylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, histamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid also stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of synaptic membranes. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained, similar to those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2 (Gullis &amp; Rowe, 1975a). The initial rate of transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA to choline glycerophospholipid was similar to the initial rate of transfer from oleate-albumin, stimulated by noradrenaline. Transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA was not appreciably stimulated by noradrenaline, but was stimulated by ATP and MgCl2.\n",
      "The interaction of magnesium ions with teichoic acid. The binding of Mg2+ to the wall teichoic acid of Lactobacillus buchneri N.C.I.B. 8007 was measured by equilibrium dialysis at controlled ionic concentration and pH. In an aqueous solution containing 10mM-NaCl at pH 5.0 one Mg2+ ion was bound for every two phosphate groups of the teichoic acid, with an apparent association constant, Kassoc. = 2.7 x 10(3) M-1. On lowering the pH below the pKa of the phosphate groups the amount of bound Mg2+ decreased concomitantly with decreasing ionization of the phosphate groups. Both the amount of Mg2+ bound to the teichoic acid and the apparent association constants were similar in the presence of 10 mM concentrations of NaCl or KCl but decreased markedly in the presence of 10 mM-CaCl2 because of competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ for the binding sites. A similar effect was found when the concentration of NaCl was increased from 0 to 50 mM. The results are discussed in relation to the function of teichoic acid in the walls of Gram-positive bacteria.\n",
      "The mechanism of hydrolysis of beta-glycerophosphate by kidney alkaline phosphatase. 1. To identify the functional groups that are involved in the conversion of beta-glycerophosphate by alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from pig kidney, the kinetics of alkaline phosphatase were investigated in the pH range 6.6-10.3 at substrate concentrations of 3 muM-30 mM. From the plots of log VH+ against pH and log VH+/KH+m against pH one functional group with pK = 7.0 and two functional groups with pK = 9.1 were identified. These groups are involved in substrate binding. Another group with pK = 8.8 was found, which in its unprotonated form catalyses substrate conversion. 2. GSH inhibits the alkaline phosphatase reversibly and non-competitively by attacking the bound Zn(II). 3. The influence of the H+ concentration on the activation by Mg2+ ions of alkaline pig kidney phosphate was investigated between pH 8.4 and 10.0. The binding of substrate and activating Mg2+ ions occurs independently at all pH values between 8.4 and 10.0. The activation mechanism is not affected by the H+ concentration. The Mg2+ ions are bound by a functional group with a pK of 10.15. 4. A scheme is proposed for the reaction between enzyme, substrate, Mg2+ and H+ and the overall rate equation is derived. 5. The mechanism of substrate binding and splitting by the functional groups of the active centre is discussed on the basis of a model. Mg2+ seems to play a role as an autosteric effector.\n",
      "The pH-dependence and group modification of beta-lactamase I. The pH-dependence of the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by beta-lactamase I (penicillinase, EC 3.5.2.6) was studied. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (6-[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido]penicillanic acid) were used. Both kcat. and kcat./Km for both substrates gave bell-shaped plots of parameter versus pH. The pH-dependence of kcat./Km for the two substrates gave the same value (8.6) for the higher apparent pK, and so this value may characterize a group on the free enzyme; the lower apparent pK values were about 5(4.85 for benzylpenicillin, 5.4 for ampicillin). For benzylpenicillin both kcat. and kcat./Km depended on pH in exactly the same way. The value of Km for benzylpenicillin was thus independent of pH, suggesting that ionization of the enzyme's catalytically important groups does not affect binding of this substrate. The pH-dependence of kcat. for ampicillin differed, however, presumably because of the polar group in the side chain. The hypothesis that the pK5 group is a carboxyl group was tested. Three reagents that normally react preferentially with carboxyl groups inactivated the enzyme: the reagents were Woodward's reagent K, a water-soluble carbodi-imide, and triethyloxonium fluoroborate. These findings tend to support the idea that a carboxylate group plays a part in the action of beta-lactamase I.\n",
      "Oxidase-peroxidase enzymes of Datura innoxia. Oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester. An enzyme system from Datura innoxia roots oxidizing formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was purified 38-fold by conventional methods such as (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, negative adsorption on alumina Cy gel and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The purified enzyme was shown to catalyse the stoicheiometric oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester to benzoylformic acid ethyl ester and formic acid, utilizing molecular O2. Substrate analogues such as phenylacetaldehyde and phenylpyruvate were oxidized at a very low rate, and formylphenylacetonitrile was an inhilating agents, cyanide, thiol compounds and ascorbic acid. This enzyme was identical with an oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme. Another oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme which separated on DEAE-chromatography also showed formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester oxidase activity, albeit to a lesser extent. The properties of the two isoenzymes of the oxidase were compared and shown to differ in their oxidation and peroxidation properties. The oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was also catalysed by horseradish peroxidase. The Datura isoenzymes exhibited typical haemoprotein spectra. The oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was different from other peroxidase-catalysed reactions in not being activated by either Mn2+ or monophenols. The oxidation was inhibited by several mono- and poly-phenols and by catalase. A reaction mechanism for the oxidation is proposed.\n",
      "Purification of 2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase and its dependence on unusual amines. 1. 2-Oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase was purified from sheep liver and gave one band on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 2. The enzyme was completely dependent for its activity on the presence of Tris or one of a number of related amines, all of general structure: (See article). When more than one R group was hydrogen no enzyme activity was observed. 3. Only one of these amines is known to exist in living tissues and large concentrations of all amines were required for maximum activity. L-2-Aminopropan-1-ol was the most effective amine on the basis of substrate Km and Vmax. values and the amine Km values. 4. The enzyme was activated by phosphate which lowered the Km values for methylglyoxal, amine and NAD+. 5. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 9.3 and there was no activity at pH values below 7.8. A search for activators that might produce activity at pH 7.4 proved unsuccessful. 6. The enzyme was inhibited by rather large concentrations of barbiturates (6-46 mM) and nitro-alcohol analogues of the activating amines (66-139 mM).\n",
      "Determination of polyadenylate-rich ribonucleic acid in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of plasmacytoma cells. A number of parameters affecting the adsorption of rRNA and poly(A)-containing RNA to Millipore filters were investigated separately. Binding of both types of RNA to the filter was dependent on the concentration of RNA, pH and Mg2+ concentration of the reaction mixture. Both types of RNA bound to the filter optimally at slightly acid pH values. The binding of poly(A)-containing RNA to the filter exhibited a broad pH-dependence compared with that of rRNA. The ratio of poly(A)-rich RNA/rRNA retained by the filter was maximal between pH7 and 8. The presence of 1 mM-EDTA or a high concentration of NaCl (over 0.5M) decreased the affinity of RNA for the filter. The amount of poly(A)-containing RNA in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of a plasmacytoma cell line (MPC-11) labelled with [32P]Pi was determined by the Millipore-filter technique under conditions that minimized contamination by rRNA. These data were compared with the estimations made by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The results obtained by these two methods were in good agreement for RNA labelled for short periods (up to 2h). In long labelling and pulse-chase experiments, however, contamination of the filter by rRNA of increasing specific radioactivity in the cytoplasm gave an erroneous value for poly(A)-containing RNA by the Millipore-filter technique. Determinations made on the nuclear fraction by these two methods did not show significant variation in short- and long-term labelling experiments.\n",

      "The amino acid sequence of Neurospora NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase. Peptides from digestion with a staphylococcal proteinase. The extracellular proteinase of Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 was used to digest the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa. Of 35 non-overlapping peptides expected from the glutamate content of the polypeptide chain, 29 were isolated and substantially sequenced. The sequences obtained were valuable in providing overlaps for the alignment of about two-thirds of the sequences found in tryptic peptides [Wootton, J. C., Taylor, J, G., Jackson, A. A., Chambers, G. K. &amp; Fincham, J. R. S. (1975) Biochem. J. 149, 739-748]. The blocked N-terminal peptide of the protein was isolated. This peptide was sequenced by mass spectrometry, and found to have N-terminal N-acetylserine by Howard R. Morris and Anne Dell, whose results are presented as an Appendix to the main paper. The staphylococcal proteinase showed very high specificity for glutamyl bonds in the NH4HCO3 buffer used. Partial splits of two aspartyl bonds, both Asp-Ile, were probably attributable to the proteinase. No cleavage of glutaminyl or S-carboxymethylcysteinyl bonds was found.

      "Activities of citrate synthase, NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in nervous tissues from vertebrates and invertebrates. 1. The activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured in nervous tissue from different animals in an attempt to provide more information about the citric acid cycle in this tissue. In higher animals the activities of citrate synthase are greater than the sum of activities of the isocitrate dehydrogenases, whereas they are similar in nervous tissues from the lower animals. This suggests that in higher animals the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is far-removed from equilibrium. If it is assumed that isocitrate dehydrogenase activities provide an indication of the maximum flux through the citric acid cycle, the maximum glycolytic capacity in nervous tissue is considerably greater than that of the cycle. This suggest that glycolysis can provide energy in excess of the aerobic capacity of the tissue. 2. The activities of glutamate dehydrogenase are high in most nervous tissues and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase are high in all nervous tissue investigated. However, the activities of alanine aminotransferase are low in all tissues except the ganglia of the waterbug and cockroach. In these insect tissues, anaerobic glycolysis may result in the formation of alanine rather than lactate.\n",
      "Properties of 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase and its relationship to microsomal mixed-function oxidation in the southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania). 1. Activity of 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase was measured in the midgut and other tissues of the last larval instar of the southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania Cramer, formerly Prodenia eridania Cramer). 2. Optimum conditions for measuring the activity were established with respect to all variables involved and considerable differences from those reported for mammalian enzyme preparations were found. 3. Maximum activity (20 nmol/h per mg of protein) occurs 18-24 h after the fifth moult and thereafter decreases to trace amounts as the larvae age and approach pupation. 4. Synthetase activity was rapidly induced by oral administration (in the diet) of pentamethylbenzene, phenobarbital, diethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridine-3, 5-dicarboxylate, and 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide. 5. Puromycin inhibited the induction of synthetase by pentamethylbenzene. 6. Induction of 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase correlated well with the induction of microsomal N-demethylation of p-chloro-N-methylaniline, except for phenobarbital, which induced the microsomal oxidase relatively more than the synthetase.\n",
      "Nitrosation of phenacetin. Formation of N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide as an unstable product of the nitrosation in dilute aqueous-acidic solution. Reaction of phenacetin with N2O4 in glacial acetic acid at 10(0) C gives N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide. This N-nitrosoacylarylamine is stable at low temperatures (--30 degress C) but unstable at ambient temperature. No intact N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide can be detected when phenacetin is nitrosated under conditions simulating those in the stomach (37 degrees C, pH 1). Instead, 2-nitro-4-ethoxybenzenediazonium chloride is the main reaction product found. Under the conditions applied, the N-nitrosoacylarylamine rapidly rearranges by 1,3-migration of the acetyl group. The resulting diazoester dissociates into the corresponding diazonium salt. Trapping of the diazonium ion with 1-naphthol as an azo dye provides a useful means to identify the parent N-nitroso compound and to measure colorimetrically its rate of formation. The yields obtained in dilute aqueous nitrosation mixtures are lower than expected; the reasons for this finding are discussed. Preliminary results of animal experiments show that the N-nitroso compound is a directly acting carcinogen.\n",

The effect of (4-acetamido-phenyl)-2-acetoxy-benzoate (benorilate, Benortan) on the inflammatory process was studied thermographically and histologically in cotton-pellet tests on rats. 2. Following implantation of the cotton-pellet, thermography shows a clear inhibition of the local inflammation due to treatment with benorilate. 3. Histological examination shows a corresponding influence of benorilate upon the proliferative phase of the inflammation. 4.

      "Acidic antiinflammatory agents--correlations of some physical, pharmacological and clinical data. Fifteen acidic antiinflammatory agents, for which some clinical data have previously been published, have been examined for their potency in the carrageenan-induced rat foot edema test, and for their acidity (pKa) and partition coefficients. Published serum half-life data and daily clinical (anti-arthritic) dose have been tabulated for these drugs and correlations between these various parameters are discussed. The rat foot edema carrageenan test has proved to be a fairly reliable predictor of clinical dose for most acidic antiinflammatory agents of moderate serum half-life.\n",
      "[Clinical trial of a novel benzodiazepine derivative in a double-blind study using the Wittenborn psychiatric rating scale (author's transl)]. From testing a new benzodiazepine derivative, 8-chloro-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-one (Bu 1014), as measured against a placebo in a double-blind trial, the following conclusions can be drawn. The test was carried out over two periods of a fortnight each with a change-over between the two periods. 1. The change-over method has proven suitable to reveal side effects of the substance which last for at least two weeks. Owing to the substance's sequelae, however, statistical analysis of the second treatment period's information is not possible with this experimental design. 2. The statistical methods used proved more effective than the usual methods as they allow clearer statements to be made on the efficacy of the substance. 3. Within the first period of 14 days both the group receiving the placebo and the drug treated group showed a decrease in the intensity of anxiety. 4. The sequelae of Bu 1014 can be described as an increase in restiveness and anxiety in those patients who received the placebo in the second treatment period.\n",
      "Flavoxate and 3-methylflavone-8-carboxylic acid. Assay methods in blood and urine, plasma-red cells repartition and stability. The following assay methods for pharmacokinetic studies on flavoxate (F) and on its main metabolite, i.e. 3-methylflavone-8-carboxylic acid (A), are described. 1. Spectrophotometry for the assay of F and of A in plasma, 2. TLC-Spectrodensitometry and GLC for the assay of A in urine after acid hydrolysis, 3. TLC-Spectrodensitometry for determining the F : A ratio in plasma or in urine. It was found that F hydrolyzes into A. This process depends on the pH and on the medium. In water, at pH 5.0, F is stable, while in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 the semi-hydrolysis time is 60 min. In a solution with bovine serum albumin, in rat, rabbit, dog or human plasma the semi-hydrolysis times are between 5 and 60 min. Finally the plasma-red cells repartitions of F and of A were studied in vitro in rat, rabbit, dog and human blood and found between 0.8 and 2.0 for F and between 2.1 and 4.6 for A.\n",
      "[On the pharmacology of 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335), a histamine and serotonin antagonist (author's transl)]. The substance 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335) was examined for its antagonistic effects against histamine and serotonin, for its atropine-like properties as well as for a series of other qualities in comparison with cyproheptadine and pimethixene. The anti-histamine and anti-serotonin activities of compound WA 335 on the smooth muscle and the capillary do not only exceed that of cyproheptadine but also that of pimethixene. WA 335 shows an extremely strong binding to histamine and serotonin receptors. In the dose range in which it causes already an antamine effect, its oral absorption is very good. The anti-anaphylactic effect is much stronger than that of cyproheptadine. Like pimethixene and cyproheptadine, WA 335 has no distinct antagonistic qualities against bradykinin. The anticholinergic effects of WA 335 are dependent on the test object. In examinations on the bronchus of the guinea pig and the pupil of the mouse, the atropine-like efficiency corresponds to that of cyproheptadine; it is stronger on the stimulated vagus of the cat and less efficient than cyproheptadine on the stomach of the rat. WA 335 has distinct central atropine-like properties. It possesses a strong surface anesthetic activity. The effects of WA 335 on circulation are dependent on species. In contrast to pimethixene, compound WA 335 like cyproheptadine potentiates the effects of norepinephrine in cats. The reduction of the carotid sinus reflex in the cat is more distinct after WA 335 than after pimethixene and corresponds to that produced by cyproheptadine. Higher doses of WA 335 than are necessary to demonstrate antaminic effects are needed to provoke central nervous effects. WA 335 shows no analgesic potency in mice. The influence on body temperature in the rat is similar to that of cyproheptadine. WA 335 is equally efficient as pimethixene with regard to the inhibition of spontaneous motility and prolongation of barbiturate sleep in mice, and shows the same anti-emetic activity as does chlorpromazine in dogs. In contrast to chlorpromazine the behaviour of dogs and cats is distinctly altered already by doses of WA 335 which cause a slight sedation.\n",
      "[Central action of WA-335-BS, a substance with peripheral antiserotonin and antihistaminic activity]. In rats and mice the serotonin and histamine antagonistic drug 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335-BS) caused stronger central sedative effects than did cyproheptadine. WA 335-BS also displayed stronger activity against reserpine- and central tremorine-induced effects than did cyproheptadine and it slightly enhanced d-amphetamine-induced effects: therefore it may have antidepressant properties. WA 335-BS proved to be very effective against isolation-induced aggression in male mice. The comparatively small anxiolytic effects may have been caused in part by the central antiserotonin properties. Like cyproheptadine, WA 335-BS increased food consumption in cats. In EEG-experiments in the conscious rabbit the serotonin-antagonistic drugs WA 335-BS and cyproheptadine exerted stronger depressant activity on the arousal reactions than did the neuroleptic chlorpromazine. The results of our animal studies suggest WA 335-BS to be an antidepressant with sedative properties.\n",
      "The distribution and elimination of radioactivity in the rat after administration of 14C-4-acetamidophenyl-2-acetoxybenzoate (benorylate). Following oral administration of 4-acetamido-phenyl-2-acetoxybenzoate (carboxyl-14C) (benorylate) to rats, no gross differences were detected 7.5 h after administration with respect to the distribution of 14C in various tissues, including the upper sections of the small intestine. A high concentration of 14C was found in the lower sections of the intestine 4 h after administration. The 14C in the intestine was present as unchanged benorylate, as detected by thin-layer chromatography, suggesting that benorylate absorption was slow. Intravenous injection of 14C-benorylate to rats showed that the drug had a relatively high elimination rate from the blood with a half-life of 1.9 h. In blood benorylate must be rapidly hydrolysed enzymatically since no 14C-metabolites, other than salicylic acid, could be detected.\n",
      "Comparative studies of parasympatholytic drugs on stomach (double blind test) and analysis of relation between gastric form and tonus. Effects of 3 kinds of parasympatholytic drugs (timepidiumbromide, hyoscine-N-butylbromide and prifinium-bromide) and placebo (physiological saline solution) on the gastrointestinal tract were evaluated roentgenographically by double blind technique in a total of 101 male human subjects. The results may briefly be summarized as follows: 1. There were significant differences on hypotonic rate being one of the indexes of the gastric tonus between timepidium-bromide and placebo. The effects of 3 experimental drugs were significantly high as compared with that of placebo on peristaltic movement of the stomach. The effect of timepidium-bromide was significantly different from that of placebo on the site of arrival of barium. 2. The comparison of degrees of the gastric tonus between main and control tests revealed that the effect of placebo obtained in the main test was significantly inferior to that of hyoscine-N-butylbromide obtained in the control test, whereas there existed no significant differences of the effects among 3 active drugs. 3. Effects of each drug on the gastric tonus which was scored by hypertonic, normotonic and hypotonic state were evaluated by stratification. The result showed that the effect of timepidium-bromide was significantly greater than that of placebo. 4. All active drugs were not significantly different in terms of 7 observed values each on the gastric form.\n",
      "[Treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with fungal lipase (author's transl)]. 7 patients suffering from severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency have been treated with a lipolytic enzyme extracted from Rhizopus arrhizus.

When incubating the enzyme in vitro in saline solutions of different pH for 1 h the loss of lipolytic activity is 13% at pH 5, 15% at pH 4, and 19% at pH 3.

      "Micellar solubilization of fatty acids in aqueous media containing bile salts and phospholipids. 1. The solubility of fatty acids in aqueous media containing bile salts alone and in admixture with either lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) or phosphatidylethanolamine was determined. 2. Over the pH range 2-0-7-4, the order of fatty acid solubility in aqueous solutions containing bile salts was linoleic greater than oleic greater than elaidic greater than palmitic greater than stearic. The solubility of each fatty acid increased as the pH of the miceus solutions of bile salts greatly increased the solubility of palmitic acid and stearic acid. 4. In the presence of bile salts and lecithin, the solubility of oleic acid and elaidic acid decreased with increasing pH of the micellar solution, indicating a competitive effect between the fatty acid anions and lecithin. The solubility of linoleic acid increased linearly with lecithin concentration. 5. Phosphatidylethanolamine as an additive to bile salts increased the solubility of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the pH range 2-3-7-4. The effectiveness of phosphatidylethanolamine as an amphiphile was similar to that of lecithin, although at pH 3.0 fatty acid solubility was greater in the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine. 6.

The solubility of fatty acids in aqueous solutions containing bile salts and lysolecithin at pH values between 2-0 and 7-4 was studied. Both the 1-acyl and 2-acyl isomers of lysolecithin increased the solubility of fatty acids to the same extent, the order of solubility being linoleic greater than oleic greater than elaidic greater than palmitic greater than stearic. 2. The influence of the products of phospholipolysis of lecithin on palmitic acid solubility was determined. On a molar basis, lysolecithin was more effective than were bile salts in promoting the solubilization of the fatty acid. 3. In bile salt solutions in which the phospholipid concentration was constant on a molar basis, in solubility of palmitic acid decreased linearly with the progressive replacement of lecithin by lysolecithin. Palmitic acid was solubilized to the same extent on replacing lecithin with lysolecithin on a constant weight basis. 4. In bile salt solution containing lysolecithin and oleic acid in equimolar amounts, the solubility of palmitic acid was similar to that in bile salt solution containing lecithin in equivalent proportion. 5.

Two immunoglobulins, IgA(K) and IgG(K), were isolated from the serum of a single patient with two monoclonal components (biclonal proteins). After chain separation, the light chains from each molecule were found to be identical by the following criteria: electrophoretic mobilities under various pH and dissociating conditions, amino acid compositon, fingerprint analysis of tryptic peptides and of 14C-succinylated chymotryptic peptides, and amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 40 residues. The heavy chains were indistinguishable for the N-terminal 45 amino acid residues.

      "Conformational properties of bovine plasma albumin with a cleaved internal peptide bond. As shown previously, proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the F conformational state near pH 3.7. The primary proteolytic product, BPA, has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately 46000 and 23000 on reduction. Evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between Cys390 and Cys434 with no detectable loss of small peptides, the amino acid composition of BPA being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error. Cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the Glx392-Phe393 bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another X-Phe bond in the unsequenced region of residues 400-402. The damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements, probably an approximate 15% loss in helicity. The hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20%. However, various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein. Of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the N-F and N-B transitions, although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate pH than in the parent protein. Moreover a sensitivity of the N-B transition to Ca2+ is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered. The results are best understood in terms of the concept of a multidomain structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma ablumin. Bond cleavage damages one domain but leaves the overall structure essentially unaltered except for some weakening of the interaction between domains.\n",

Porcine pancreas synthesizes a prephospholipase A2 which occurs in a 5 : 95 ratio compared with the more abundant zymogen of the same enzyme (phosphatide-acylhydrolase; EC 3.1.1.4). These two prephospholipases could be well separated by CM-cellulose chromatography. Both the active and the zymogen form of the isoenzyme were isolated and purified. The activation peptides of both prephospholipases appeared to be identical, while the active enzymes showed a few interesting differences. The most striking differences were the loss of one histidine and one methionine in the isoenzyme, corresponding to residues 24 and 27, respectively, in alpha-phospholipase A2. The positional and stereo specificity of both enzymes are the same, but the specific activity of the beta-phospholipase A2 is lower.

This amylase showed maximal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 6.80. The pH stability range was relatively wide, the enzyme retaining more than 90% of its initial activity in the range of 6.50-9.0. 80% of the activity was retained after 15 min at 50 degrees C. This enzyme produced maltohexaose from starch, amylose and amylopectin by exo-attack, but did not act on alpha- or beta-cyclodextrin, pullulan or maltohexaitol. Also the enzyme acted on beta-limit dextrins of amylopectin and glycogen to form branched oligosaccharides. The unusual reaction of this enzyme on beta-limit dextrin is discussed from the standpoint of the stereochemistry of 1,4-alpha- and 1,6-alpha-glucosidic bonds. This is the anomalous amylase for which it is recognized that 1,6-alpha-glucosidic linkages in the substrates can mimic the effect of 1,4-alpha-bonds, as previously observed in pseudo-priming reactions of E. coli phosphorylase.\n",
      "Inhibition of human liver beta-galactosidases and beta-glucosidase by n-bromoacetyl-beta-D-galactosylamine. N-Bromoacetyl-beta-D-galactosylamine is an irreversible inhibitor of the 'acid' and the 'neutral' beta-galactosidases (beta-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.23) of human liver. The inactivation of acid beta-galactosidase appears to involve a group with a pKa = 4.5. The inhibition of neutral beta-galactosidase only occurs above pH 8.0. Both enzymes are protected against inhibition by the presence of substrates, suggesting that the inhibitor reacts with the active site of the enzymes. Other lysosomal hydrolases are not inhibited by N-bromoacetyl-beta-D-galactosylamine, with the exception of 'neutral' beta-glucosidase (beta-D-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.21). The pH dependence of neutral beta-glucosidase inactivation is essentially identical to that of the neutral beta-galactosidase. Inhibition of beta-glucosidase by this galactose derivative suggests that the same enzyme may bind glucosides and galactosides. Furthermore, both neutral beta-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase are inactivated at 52 degrees C with a half-life of 7.5 min. The presence of a single enzyme with both beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities is also supported by mixed-substrate experiments.\n",
      "Endo-arabinanase from Bacillus subtilis F-11. An arabinanase was purified from the culture fluid of Bacillus subtilis F-11. The process was as follows: salting out by (NH4)2SO4, repeated chromatography on hydroxy apatite and gel filtration on Sepharose-6B. The purified enzyme was demonstrated to be homogeneous by disc electrophoresis. The enzyme was found to be active on arabinan and 1,5-arabinan, but inactive on phenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside, arabinoxylan, gum arabic. The enzyme released arabinose, arabinobiose, arabinotriose and higher oligosaccharides during the course of hydrolysis of 1,5-arabinan. The end products were found to be arabinose and arabinobiose after 144 h of hydrolysis.\n",
      "Aminopeptidases in webbing clothes moth larvae. Properties and specificities of the enzymes of intermediate electrophoretic mobility. The major group of aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11.-) of intermediate electrophoretic mobility, from Tineola bisselliella larvae, hav been fractionated into six bands by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the properties of these fractions investigated. They resemble each other in their pH optima of 8.2, their molecular weight of 240 000, their responses to various active site inhibitors and metal cations, and their specificities towards seventeen L-amino-acyl-beta-naphthylamide substrates. The derivatives of methionine, leucine, alanine, lysine, arginine and glutamic acid were those most rapidly hydrolysed. They appear to be true aminopeptidases hydrolysing amino acid amides, dipeptides and oligopeptides from the N-terminal end.\n",
      "Studies on an activator of the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase of human erythrocyte membranes. 1. An activator of the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-stimulated ATPase present in the human erythrocytes (membrane) has been isolated in soluble form from hemolysates of these cells. Partial purification has been achieved through use of carboxymethyl-Sephadex chromatography. The resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3% of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 3. When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release. When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations. Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates. These observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the (membrane-free) hemolysates and in membranes. It further supports the conclusion that Pi release from ADP by human erythrocytes (freeze-thawed) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of ATP by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated ATP by (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase. 4. The following points were also established: (a) absence of an ADPase in human erythrocytes; (b) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gama-position of ATP and (c) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin.\n",
      "[Acid and alkaline denaturation of superoxide dismutase]. Optical and ESR spectra of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase denaturated with acid and alkali are described. Sharp changes in activity and spectra were found. \"Residual\" activity of alkaline denaturated protein was higher than of acidic denaturated sample.

The characteristics of light scattering of cell suspensions in norm (pH 7,2, t=20degreesC) and upon external influences (change of pH and increase of tdegree). The turbidity tauapproximatelylambda-n and n=0,2--0,3 for cells in norm. After cell damage n increases. Dependence of n correlates with the increase of some injured cells determined by eozin test. Alterations of light scattering after cell damage were connected with the increase of deposit of intercellular structure in general scattering.\n",
      "[The fragmentation and reconstruction of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase system of liver mitochondria]. The protein and proteolipid complexes and oligomycin insensitive soluble ATPase were prepared from rat liver mitochondria. The incubation of soluble ATPase with protein and proteolipid complexes resulted in restoration of ATPase sensitivity to oligomycin at room temperature. The process of reconstruction depended on pH, incubation time, temperature and other conditions.\n",
      "[Study of acetyl-CoA-synthetase from staphylococcus aureus]. Acetyl-CoA-synthetase was isolated from cells of St. aureus 209-P. The method of isolation and partial purification of the enzyme is worked out. Km values of the enzyme for acetate, CoA and ATP are calculated. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and monoiodoacetate were shown to inhibit the enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is estimated depending on the age of the cell culture and on the presence of acetate in the culture medium.\n",
      "[Effect of prosthetic group of horseradish peroxidase on enzyme stability]. Constants of inactivation rate of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) apo-HRP and apo-HRP-protoporphyrin (PP) are estimated at the pH range 2.8-12.8 and 25 degrees C. Two ionogenic groups (acid and alkaline) are detected on cases of HRP and apo-HRP, which are responsible for stable HRP conformation. HRP stability within the pH range 5-10 exceeded 30 times that of apo-HRP, while the stability apo-HRP-PP complex is similar to that of apo-HRP. The data obtained show that formation of complex of apo-HRP with PP, an analogue of the prostetic group lacking central Fe atom, practically does not affect the stability of HRP protein globula at pH 5-10, but significantly stabylized apo-HRP at the extreme pH values. The complex formation of apo-HRP with active prosthetic group - hemin - results on the stable conformation of the HRP protein globula, which suggests a determining role of Fe ion - porphyrin complex (hemin) on the support of the stable HRP structure.\n",
      "[Wheat protein disulfide reductase]. Proteindisulphide reductase is isolated and partially purified from wheat seedlings and some properties of the enzyme are studied: pH optimum is 7.4; temperature optimum - 37 degrees C; Km = 2.6-10(-4)M for the substrate (wheat albumin); Km = 7.5-10(-5) M for coenzyme (NADP-H). The enzyme is specific for NADP-H and is not active in the presence of NAD-H. Maximal activity of proteindisulphide reductase is developed in anaerobic conditions. A technique of the estimation of proteindisulphide reductase activity using wheat albumin as a substrate is worked out. The enzyme activity decreases regularly in the corn ripening and increases under germination. It is accompanied by the respective increase or decrease in the amount of disulphide bonds in gluten protein and by changes of physico-chemical characteristics of gluten. Incubation of gluten with the enzyme preparation affects reological properties of gluten (it becomes weaker) and decreases the gluten viscosity of gluten solution.\n",
      "[Modification of pancreatic ribonuclease activity in complexes with polyanions]. Carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylchitin, sulfoethylcellulose and dextrane sulfate interact with pancreatic ribonuclease. In comparison with ribonuclease activity the activity of formed complexes changes differently at the stages of transesterification and hydrolysis, and at each stage the effect of polymers on ribonuclease activity essentially differs. The use of ribonuclease-dextrane sulfate complex in the reaction of uridylyl-(3' leads to 5')-cytidine synthesis demonstrated that the protein synthetic activity completely retained when hydrolytic activity was considerably suppressed.\n",
      "[Kinetics and mechanism of action of horseradish peroxidase in the reaction of dioxyfumaric acid oxidation with atmospheric oxygen]. Quantitative kinetic data are given on the oxidation reaction of dioxyfumaric acid (DFA) with atmospheric oxygen in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) depending on pH. Activation constants of oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and Mn ions are determined at pH 3.0. Autocatalytic character of FRA oxidation is shown to be due to the formation of H2O2 and other hydro peroxide-type compounds in the reaction, HRP convertions in the DFA--O2 system are studied using spectrophotometry. A mechanism of the initiation of free radicals in HRP--DFA--O2 system is proposed.\n",
      "[Some physical and chemical properties of serinesulfhydrase from chicken liver]. An improved procedure of purification of serinesulfhydrase from chicken liver is described. Preparations of enzyme (700-fold purification with the yield of 40 per cent from total activity) have been obtained homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular weight of serinesulfhydrase is 90.000; 1 mole of enzyme contains 2 moles of pyridoxalphosphate and consists apparently of 2 subunits. Amino acid composition of the enzyme is studied. Absorption spectrum of serinesulfhydrase has a maximum at 430 nm what is characteristic of numerous pyridoxal-P enzymes. The position of this maximum does not depend on pH (within its range 6--10) and the presence of  L-serine, a primary enzyme substrate. An essential change in the absorption spectrum of enzyme was observed in the presence of some thiol compound--DL-homocysteine, beta-mercaptoethanol and glutathione (cosubstrates of the reaction) and L-cysteine (a primary reaction substrate). It is suggested that this change in the spectrum is due to the action of SH-compounds on the enzyme conformation before the beginning of the enzymatic reaction or on its initial stages.\n",
      "[Specificity of extracellular alkaline RNAase from Penicillium chrysogenum 152A]. Specificity of chromatographically homogenous extracellular alkaline RNAase from Pen. crysogenum 152A on RNA, synthetic polynucleotides, dinucleosidemonophosphates and nucleoside-2',3'-cyclophosphates is studied. The enzyme is found to release from RNA guanosine-3'-monophosphate and guanosine-2',3'-cyclophosphate only. Guanylic acid is a 3'-terminal nucleotide of oligonucleotides of different length. The enzyme readily hydrolyses poly-I and practically do not splits poly-G. GpN is demonstrated to be a good substrate for the RNase, while G greater than p hydrolyses with a low rate. The RNAase catalyses the synthesis of GpC (47.7 per cent yield) and GpU (38.8 per cent yield). Thus, the RNAase from Pen. chrysogenum 152A is considered to be guanyl-RNAase.\n",
      "[Intermediate plateaux in kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by biodegradative L-threonine dehydratase from Escherichia coli]. It has been shown that for the reaction catalyzed by \"biodegradative\" L-threonine dehydratase from E. coli strains K-12 and 980 in 0.5 M phosphate-carbonate buffer, pH 8.4 and pH 9.5, the plots of initial reaction rate (v) versus the initial substrate concentration ([S]0 are characterized by several inflection points, i. e. an intermediate plateau. The plot of v versus the allosteric activator (AMP) concentration have very complicated shapes: there are several inflection points, and also the maximum at L-threonine concentration equal to 3-10(2) and 5-10(-2) M. High AMP concentrations inhibit the enzyme at high substrate concentrations. The reduced glutathion dose not influence the enzyme and does not alter the activating effect of AMP. On the basis of the data obtained it is proposed that the substrate and AMP shift the equilibrium between multiple oligomeric enzyme forms differing in catalytic activity and kinetic manifestations of allosteric interactions between the active and allosteric AMP-binding sites towards polymerization. Thus, the functioning the enzyme under study is discussed in the frames of the model of dissociating regulatory enzymes with multiple intermediate oligomeric forms.\n",
      "[Multiple forms of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase revealed by means of specific elution]. The modified procedure for rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase (PFK) purification is worked out utioizing the method of specific elution from DEAE-cellulose in 0.1 M tris-EDTA-phosphate pH 8.0 with 10 mM citrate. By the latter procedure PFK can be resolved into fractions A, B and C which are eluted specifically, with 0.3 M buffer and with 1.5 M NaCl respectively. Rechromatography of each fraction reveals their interconvertibility. The preparations are characterized by disc electrophoresis and velocity sedimentation. The results of formalinization experiments demonstrate that high concentrations of formaldehyde dissociate PFK u to the 5.3 S component. The presence of the 19.3 S component in the formalinized preparations evidences against the possibility that the middle component, presented at the schlieren patterns of PFK at pH 8.0, is and artifact of superposition. Complex profiles of protein distribution observed in different transport experiments are discussed from the point of view of slow equilibrium of oligomers and conformers characteristic to PFK over the pH range from 6 to 9.\n",
      "[Isoenzymes of phosphorylase from skeletal muscles of cyclostomata and raw-boned fish]. Separation and partial purification of isoenzymes of phosphorylase B from skeletal muscles of lamprey (Lampetra) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) was carried out. Isoenzyme I was adsorbed on DEAE cellulose and eluted by KCl; isoenzyme II was not adsorbed on DEAE cellulose. A number of kinetic characteristics of phosphorylase of the coldblooded were determined, e. g. Km values for glucose-1-phosphate, glycogen and AMP; Ki for glucose-6-phosphate; stability towards denaturation (heating and effect of urea) and pH optimum. It was observed that in the course of evolution of vertebrates the Km values for substrates and allosteric activator (AMP), as well as the inhibition by glucose-6-phosphate showed a decrease. Isoenzymes I and II of phosphorylase B were found non-identical with respect to some molecular characteristics, in carp the differences being far more pronounced than in lamprey.\n",
      "[Activity of polynucleotide phosphorylase in ribosomal fraction of rat liver]. A method of isolating polynucleotidephosphorylase (PNPase) containing polyribosome fraction from rat liver is described. PNPase is found to be bind to RNA in polyribosomes with weak electrostatic bonds which are easily broken down in a weak alkaline medium with ionic strength more than 0.1 beta-22P-labelled ADP, GDP, UDP and CDP are found among the products of endogenous RNA degradation in the fraction of total polyribosomes in the presence of 32P-orthophosphate. A considerable change in the base composition of PNP-degraded RNA is observed at different incubation times of total polyribosomes with 32P-orthophosphate: G+C//A+U ratio increased from 2.3 to 3.1, and purines/pyrimidines ratio-from 0.47 to 1.06 with the increase of the incubation time. Specific activity of PNP in ribosome fractions obtained under ultracentrifugation of total polyribosomes in succrose density gradient (0.3-1.0 M) increased in the direction from the fraction of heavy polysomes to trimers and dimers and then dropped at the region of monomers (80 S particles). The data obtained give no possibility to determine the type of PNP-bound RNA in polyribomes of rat liver.\n",
      "[The effect of oxidazable substrates and ATP on the sensitivity of certain energy-dependent functions submitochondrial particles to phospholipases A, C and D]. The effect of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity of a number of energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles ot phospholipases A, C and D has been studied. It has been shown that in the conditions of oxidation of NADH and succinate by oxygen and also of ATP hydrolysis, the decrease in the phosphorylating activity of the particles under the action of phospholipases C and D accelerates. No such acceleration has been observed with phospholipase A. For other two functions, i. e. reverse electron transfer (ATP-dependent NAD+ reduction by succinate) and ATP-dependent transhydrogenase reaction the results proved to be different. Oxidizable substrates and ATP promoted the maintenance of these functions in the presence of phospholipase A, but did not retard their suppression by phospholipases C and D. The effects of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity  of different energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles to phospholipases A, C and D could be removed by the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. The conclusion is made that the effects revealed are associated with an increase in the sensitivity of coupling sites II PAND/OR III to phospholipases C and D and with a decrease in the sensitivity of sites I and IV to phospholipase A on energization of submitochondrial particles.\n",
      "[Flourescent properties of histidine decarboxylase from Micrococcus sp. n]. A dependency of fluorescence parameters of histidinedecarboxylase (HDC) from Micrococcuc sp. n. on pH values is studied. Native HDS has a short-waved maximum position (325 nm) and a small half-width of the fluorescence spectrum (48nm). The change in the quantum yield of the enzyme fluorescence was parallel with the change of the enzymatic activity. Triptophane residues of native HDC are located at hydrophobic region of the enzyme globula. The dependency of HDC flourescence parameters on pH values in 8 M urea was similar to that of free triptophane. A comparative study of fluorescences parameters of HDC and its inhibitory complexes with methyl ester of histidine (MEH), hydroxylamine and p-chloromercuriumbensoate is carried out. The effect of HDC interacting with inhibitors on fluorescence parameters of the enzyme is discussed. No differences were found in infra-red spectra of HDC and its inhibitory complex with MEH.\n",
      "A model for the origin of stable protocells in a primitive alkaline ocean. When a mixture of the eighteen proteinous amino acids are suitably heated in the dry state with seawater salts, a copolyamino acid results. One fraction of this polymer is found, through isoelectric focusing, to consist of a mixture of acidic and basic proteinoids, each of sharply limited heterogeneity. When one fraction of the seawater proteinoid is dissolved in hot water, and the solution is cooled, proteinoid microspheres result. These have properties in common with simpler types, but also stable at pH values to 9, in common with microspheres prepared by mixing acidic and basic proteinoids. These processes thus constitute a simple model for the origin of a protocell stable in a primitive alkaline ocean.\n",
      "Hypothesis on the role of liganded states of proteins in energy transducing systems. In energy transducing systems the direction of energy transfer is proposed to be maintained by the synchronized turnovers of the conformational change of one protein coupling up to affect another. Catalysis by those systems implies, therefore, that under new space restrictions the groups of the transducing enzyme increase and decrease reactivity between themselves, with activatory and/or inhibitory ligands (H+, H2O, metals, etc.) and with the electron shells of the reactant molecules. The exergonic reaction-dependent turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained, therefore, under asymmetric phase angles of conformational-dependent reactivity that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of transducing systems. Some well known reactions, such as hemoglobins Bohr effect, can be used to illustrate that microscopic (molecular) interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly paricipate as driving forces in energy transducing sytems. This would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a modificatory force of the structural parameters of proteins. Similarly, the relationship between the liganded states of hemoglobin and its change in conformation has been used to develop an illustrative model relating changes in oxido-reduction of electron carriers to induced-fit effects leading to a sequence of ATPase forms in transition complexes which become stabilized as high energy intermediates under the constraints imposed by the membrane of energy transducing organelles.\n",
      "Some properties of a protease (subtilisin BPN') immobilized to porous glass. Subtilisin BPN' was immobilized to porous glass via isothiocyanate coupling. The pH optimum of the enzyme was shifted to the alkaline side on binding. This effect was more pronounced with ethyl lactate than with N-tosyl arginine methyl ester (TAME). Presumably, the shift is a reflection of the negative charge on the surface of the glass. The Michaelis constant and Vmax of soluble subtilisin BPN' with TAME were two and one orders of magnitude, respectively, lower than with ethyl lactate. Vmax, calculated per g of active enzyme, with TAME as the substrate was not affected by immobilization, while Vmax with ethyl lactate decreased greater than tenfold. The apparent KM decreased on immobilization with ethyl lactate as substrate and increased with TAME. Results are explained in terms of diffusional resistance and a possible attraction of ethyl lactate to the glass surface. Active site titration indicated that about 25% of the immobilized enzyme was active.\n",
      "Profiles for pH, temperature, and dissolved O2 levels in enzyme production: monitoring in small-scale fermentors. The profiles thus established may be utilized for investigations of an organism's relationship to its microenvironment including metabolic shifts and pathways. Areas of maximum respiratory activity, enzyme production, enzyme degradation, and attainment of the stationary phase are quite evident; however, duration and magnitude of the various phenomena may change with nutrient, temperature, and aeration efficiency. Practical application of this simplified method would include: a) determination of environmental conditions existing during maximum growth or enzyme synthesis and application of these conditions to feedback control; b) estimation of requirements for pH, oxygen, and heat removal capacities needed for scale-up; c) specific points during the fermentation at which samples should be analyzed to yield maximum information on depletion of nutrients and its effects on microbial activity.\n",
      "The specificity of heterophil antibodies in patients and healthy donors with no or minimal signs of infectious mononucleosis. Over several years sera were collected from 14 heterophil-positive students or patients who did not fulfill minimal hematologic criteria for infectious mononucleosis (I.M.) The specificity of these heterophil reactions for I.M. was investigated by determining antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-determined antigens, i.e., to viral capsid antigens (VCA), early antigens (EA), and EBV-associated nuclear antigens (EBNA). On the basis of detectable anti-EA and/or the early absence and late emergence of anti-EBNA, four of these 14 individuals showed evidence of a current or very recent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. The other ten patients showed antibody patterns indicative of Epstein-Barr virus infections in the past, and no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to the specificity of their heterophil reactions. It was assumed, however, that some represented atypical clinical forms of EBV infection and that timing of specimen collection was a factor in explaining the paucity of Downey cells. In three patients, the absorbed heterophil-positive reactions persisted with little change in titer for at least 22 mo and thus might represent false-positive tests.\n",
      "Bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anaemia from a HL-A and MLC-identical unrelated donor. Bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) from an unrelated, HL-A-phenotype-identical, MLC-negative donor was performed in a 31 year old woman with severe longlasting aplastic anemia. In vitro assays failed to demonstrate humoral or cellular sensitization of the recipient against donor-type antigens. Following conditioning with cyclophosphamide, prompt but only transient engraftment of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of the liver. The results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor cannot be evaluated due to early death of the recipient. It is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated, HL-A and MLC-identical donors may engraft without severe GVHD. Rejection of the graft in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between HL-A and MLC-identical unrelated individuals than between HL-A and MLC-identical siblings. However, insufficient preparative immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide due to severe hepatic hemosiderosis appears equally likely as the cause of graft rejection. The possibly increased risk of graft rejection or severe GVHD should not preclude the use of unrelated HL-A and MLC-identical marrow donors, when histocompatible sibling donors are not available; but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the cyclophosphamide protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent engraftment.\n",
      "Evidence for noradrenaline and adrenaline as sympathetic transmitters in the chicken. 1 The concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline in various organs, arterial plasma and venous outflow from isolated hearts of adult chickens have been determined. 2 The relative adrenaline concentrations (percentage of the sum of noradrenaline and adrenaline) in the heart (33%), spleen (16%) and brain (26%) were higher than those found in mammalian organs. Chemical sympathectomy by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine caused a decrease of the noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations in the heart to 20 and 23% and in the spleen to 16 and 29%, respectively. 3 Stimulation of the right sympathetic nerves, infusion of tyramine or infusion of a modified Tyrode solution containing 108mM K+ and 44 mM Na+ caused an output of both noradrenaline and adrenaline into the perfusate of isolated hearts. The relative adrenaline concentration in the perfusate (20-28%) was not significantly different from the relative adrenaline concentration remaining in these hearts (19-22%). In the individual experiments, the noradrenaline: adrenaline ratios of the stimulation perfusates were positively correlated with the ratios found in the hearts. 4 The effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on cardiac rate and tension development were studied in spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven left atria, respectively. In addition, the arterial pressure rise in response to noradrenaline or adrenaline was;measured in chickens. It was found that the cardio-vaseart rate, cardiac tension development and arterial blood pressure, was not significantly different from that of adrenaline. 5 It is concluded that, in the chicken heart and spleen, both noradrenaline and adrenaline act as sympathetic neutrotransmitters.\n",
      "Antiarrhythmic, haemodynamic and metabolic effects of 3alpha-amino-5alpha-androstan-2beta-ol-17-one hydrochloride in greyhounds following acute coronary artery ligation. 1  The antiarrhythmic, haemodynamic and metabolic effects of a new amino steroid, ORG6001, have been investigated in experimental acute myocardial infarction in anaesthetized greyhounds. 2 ORG6001 administered either intravenously (2-10 mg/kg) or orally (50 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats in the first 30 min after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. 3 In dogs pretreated with ORG6001, metabolic changes indicative of myocardial ischaemia (lactate production and potassium efflux) were less marked than those occurring in control animals. 4 Antiarrhythmic doses of ORG6001 caused only minimal transient haemodynamic effects. 5 These results suggest that ORG6001 may possess distinct advantages over presently-used antiarrhythmic drugs in the prevention and treatment of the early arrhythmias which occur after myocardial infarction.\n",
      "The use of radioactive microspheres to compare the effects of hydralazine, guanethidine and SK &amp; F 24260 on the redistribution of cardiac output in anaesthetized rabbits. 1 The use of radioactive microspheres is described for the measurement of cardiac output in anaesthetized rabbits and its redistribution after the administration of drugs which lower blood pressure. 2 Hydralazine increased peripheral vascular conductance by 123%. The vascular beds in which it had most effect were those of the carcass (mainly muscle) and the kidneys. 3 SK&amp;F 24260, (1,4 dihydro-2, 6-dimethyl-4(2-trifluoremethylpheny)-3,5,-pyridinedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester), had similar vasocilator actions. Its effect in the carcass contributed relatively more to the increase of total peripheral conductance. It also caused a remarkable degree of cerebral vasodilatation. 4 Guanethidine had a relatively small effect on total peripheral conductance and lowered blood pressure mainly by reducing stroke volume and cardiac output.\n",
      "Impact of psychosocial factors on the conduct of combined drug and psychotherapy research. The effect of attitudes of therapists, patients and researchers on the conduct and outcome of combined drug and psychotherapy research was examined in a brief crisis-oriented psychotherapy clinic. Seventy-seven consecutive patients were given one of two anti-anxiety drugs or a placebo in conjunction with the typical psychoanalytically-oriented treatment used in the clinic. The therapists' attitudes favouring psychotherapy over drug therapy (and psychotherapy research) were clearly conveyed to the patients. Indicative of this are the following: (a) 82 per cent of the patients dropped out of drug taking, although a similar percentage remained in treatment; (b) only a third of the patients perceived it as being important to their therapists that they should take medication; (c) 87 per cent of the patients were rated as improved; and 75 per cent of patients completing forms considered that most or all of their improvement was attributable to talking. The research team, made up of members of the same department who therefore had similar values as the therapists, diligently collected outcome data, but ignored its responsibility to enforce drug-relation portions of the protocol. Overall, patients remained in therapy, improved and participated in completing forms, so that only the research goals of combined therapy were thwarted, while traditional clinic service and training goals proceeded as usual.\n",
      "Neurochemical studies in a mouse teratoma with neuroepithelial differentiation. Presence of cyclic AMP, serotonin and enzymes of the serotonergic, adrenergic and cholinergic systems. A transplantable mouse testicular teratoma (OTT 6050) which displays a spectrum of neuroepithelial differentiation was evaluated biochemically for concentrations of cyclic AMP (cAMP), serotonin (5-HT), and enzymes involved in the metabolism of the biogenic amines and acetylcholine. These values were compared between teratomas with neuroepithelial differentiation as the major or minor component and brains of neonatal and adult mice of related strains. cAMP, 5-HT, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were present. In addition, enzymes of the adrenergic system, i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and of the cholinergic system, i.e. choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase, were studied. Biochemical differences in tumor groups probably reflected variations in the proportion of neuroepithelial components: trends suggested an increase of cAMP and an increased activity of TPH, AADC, TH and DBH in tumors with increased proportions of neuroepithelial cells. These findings indicate that the neuroepithelial component of the mouse teratoma may serve as a model for the study of neuronal differentiation in primitive neuroepithelial neoplasms.\n",
      "Trans-synaptic regulation of the development of end organ innervation by sympathetic neurons. To examine the regulation of development of end organ innervation the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), and two of its target organs, the iris and pineal gland, were studied using biochemical and histofluorescent approaches. During postnatal ontogeny the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH), which is localized to adrenergic neurons, increased 50-fold in iris, and 34-fold in pineal nerve terminals of the rat. These increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) uptake, a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane. These biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation, adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber fluorescence intensity as determined by fluorescence microscopy. Unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the SCG in 2-3-day-old rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation: T-OH activity, [3H]NE uptake, innervation density, plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in irides innervated by decentralized ganglia. It is concluded that trans-synaptic factors regulate the maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals, and the development of end organ innervation by SCG.\n",
      "Mechanism of action of Mg2+ and Zn2+ on rat placental alkaline phosphatase. I. Studies on the soluble Zn2+ and Mg2+ alkaline phosphatases. Rat placental alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), a dimer of 135,000 daltons, is strongly activated by Mg2+. However, Zn2+ has to be present on the apoenzyme to obtain this activation. Mg2+ alone is unable to reconstitute functional active sites. Excess Zn2+ which competes for the Mg2+ site leads to a phosphatase with little catalytic activity at alkaline pH but with normal active sites at acidic pH as shown by covalent incorporation of ortho-[32P]phosphate. Two enzyme species with identical functional active sites have been reconstituted that only differ by the presence of Zn2+ or Mg2+ at the effector site. A mechanism is presented by which alkaline phosphatase activity of rat placenta would be controlled by a molecular process involving the interaction of Mg2+ and Zn2+ with the dimeric enzyme molecule.\n",
      "Porcine chymotrypsin A-pi, a more acidic chymotrypsin. A kinetic study of procine chymotrypsin A-pi revealed two characteristic properties of this type of chymotrypsin: 1. Porcine chymotrypsin A-pi, like bovine chymotrypsin B-pi does not bind proflavin, which is a competitive inhibitor of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin A-alpha. 2. The pH profiles of the steady-state parameters show the two usual important pK's. The basic one, pK2 = 9.6, affects both Km and kcat/Km and probably controls the binding conformation of chymotrypsin. The acidic one, pK1 = 5.7, affects kcat and kcat/Km and plays a role in the catalytic process. The value of pK1 is unusually low.\n",
      "Properties of a free and a solubilized form of bound alpha,alpha-trehalase purified from honey bee thorax. The free and bound forms of alpha,alpha-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) of the honey bee thorax were separated and the bound enzyme was solubilized by raising the pH to 8.0 for 10 h. Both enzymes were purified. They were homogeneous as determined by several electrophoretic criteria. It was found that the two enzymes had very similar Km's (each about 0.89 mM), Vm's (53.2 and 54.3 U/mg for free and solubilized, respectively), inhibition characteristics, specificities (both only hydrolyzed alpha,alpha-trehalose), pH maxima (each had maxima at about 3.5 and 6.5), molecular weights (65,000), isoelectric points (5.1), reactivities to sulfhydryl reagents, electrophoretic mobilities, activation energies (about 12.8 kcal/mol), and similar stabilities to heat, pH, and urea. Some significant differences between the two enzymes were, however, found: the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase floated at 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate while the free alpha,alpha-trehalase did not; the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase did not dissociate into subunits as readily as did the free one; and the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase was found to bind more readily to a hydrophobic grouping than the free enzyme. In addition to these comparisons, three new findings relating to thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are reported. (1) Thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are strongly inhibited by beta-glucosides (Ki values of about 8 x 10(-4) M); (2) under certain conditions thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases from honey bees dissociated into subunits of one-half the normal molecular weight; (3) honey bee thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases have unusual biphasic pH activity profiles.\n",
      "Immunotherapy for cancer: an overview. Immunotherapy of cancer is of interest to oncologists because it is specifically directed to cancer cells, sparing normal cells. While it is ineffective in most patients, especially those with widespread metastatic disease, it occasionally produces good results. Each of the available methods has inherent problems and, recently, attempts have been made to overcome some of these. There is a strong case for small-scale experimental trials in highly selected groups of patients who are intensively investigated for their immunologic status in relation to their tumour. Despite the lack of success in general, immunotherapy still appears to have a future as an adjunct to existing therapy in order to control as much as to cure residual tumour.\n",
      "L-[alphaS, 5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (NSC-163501): a new amino acid antibiotic with the properties of an antagonist of L-glutamine. L-[alphaS,5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (NSC-163501), an antibiotic elaborated by Streptomyces sviceus, has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of many mammalian and bacterial reactions involving the transfer of nitrogen from the gamma-carboxamide of L-glutamine. Thus, the utilization of L-glutamine for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate, L-asparagine, guanosine-5'-monophosphate, cytidine-5'-triphosphate, N-formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide, NAD, glucosamine-6-phosphate, and anthranilic acid is strongly or totally inhibited by a concentration of NSC-163501 of 1 X 10(-3) M. L-Glutamate synthetase of Escherichia coli is only modestly inhibited and 5-phosphoribosylamine synthesis in fetal rat liver is comparatively refractory to inhibition. NSC-163501 treatment of L1210 cells growing in a low L-glutamine culture medium produced arrest in G or early S phase. Of the amino acids tested, only L-glutamine antagonized such growth inhibition.\n",
      "Antitumor and immunosuppressive activities of lankacidin-group antibiotics: structure-activity relationships. The antitumor and immunosuppressive activities of the lankacidin-group antibiotics were studied in mice. Seventeen of 29 newly prepared lankacidin-group antibiotics, including 14-derivatives of lankacidin C, lankacidinol, isolankacidinol, and lankacidinol 14-acetate, possessed considerable antitumor activity against ascites 6C3HED/OG lymphosarcoma. Comparative studies on the antitumor activity of lankacidin C and eight of its derivatives against L1210 leukemia and solid 6C3HED/OG lymphosarcoma demonstrated that replacement of the hydroxyl group at position 8 or 14 of lankacidin C by an acyloxy group potentiated antitumor activity. However, these modifications of lankacidin C resulted in reduction of the immunosuppressive activity.\n",
      "Evidence for a physiological role of renal sympathetic nerves in adrenergic stimulation of renin release in the rat. Previous studies on renin release by an in vitro system of rat kidney slices, which is devoid of hemodynamic influences, have provided evidence that renin release is stimulated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. We used this system to study effects of tyramine (an indirectly acting amine capable of displacing endogenous catecholmines from sympathetic nerve endings) on renin release. Tyramine (10(-3)M) in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (pheniprazine, 10(-5)M) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (theophylline, 10(-3)M) significantly (P less than 0.01) stimulated renin release when values were compared to control observations for media containing only the inhibitors. Tyramine-induced stimulation of renin release was blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol (2 X 10(-4) M), and the neural uptake blocking agent, cocaine (10(-5) M), but not by the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine (9 X 10(-4) M). These observations demonstrate a potential role for the sympathetic innervation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on renin release.\n",
      "Effects of storage in the cold on activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase in serum. Sera from patients with hepatobiliary disorders were selected to represent a wide range of activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2). Samples were stored at 4 degrees C and periodically tested for as long as nine weeks, others at -6 degrees C for as long as 40 weeks. The frozen-stored samples were thawed and then frozen again after each testing. The activity of the enzyme was essentially unchanged under both conditions of storage. These results are consistent with comments in the literature on the enzyme's stability.\n",
      "Quantitative fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes according to their thermostability. Continuous monitoring of heat denaturation of a mixture of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes at 60 degrees C and pH 7.5 permits the simultaneous direct identification and quantitation of three isoenzymes: the placental isoenzyme, the L-phenylalanine-sensitive intestinal isoenzyme, and the liver isoenzyme (hepatocytic). The isoenzyme that is principally of bone origin cannot be identified as such without the help of other diagnostic aids and the patient's medical history. All human tissues contain alkaline phosphatase, many organs more than one of the isoenzymes. Liver alkaline phosphatase, which constitutes 40-50% of normal serum alkaline phosphatase activity, was measured in the serum of persons with various liver diseases. Its activity exceeded normal in all types of liver disease; in 80% of cases this increase was accompanied by increased gamma-glutamyl-transferase activity, but the quantitative correlationship (r = 0.54) was not as good as expected if both enzymes come from the same source and are indices of liver dieases. Liver alkaline phosphatase activity increases in the blood early in liver disease, before most liver tests show abnormalities. The other major isoenzyme of normal serum probably represents a mixture of isoenzymes from bone and reticulo-endothelial and vascular tissues, which all contain the same \"very heat-labile\" alkaline phosphatase. Cord blood and children's sera contain mostly this very heat-labile isoenzyme.\n",
      "Spectrophotometric end-point method for assay of serum cystyl-aminopeptidase in pregnancy. An optimized end-point method that requires little sophisticated equipment is described for estimating serum cystyl-aminopeptidase during pregnancy. S-Benzyl-L-cysteine-4-nitroanilide is used as the substrate.\n",
      "Improved separation of creatine kinase cardiac isoenzyme in serum by batch fractionation. I describe a simple, single-tube batch fractionation procedure for separating MM and MB isoenzymes of creatine kinase on a macroporous strong anion exchanger (AG MP-1, Bio-Rad Laboratories). The isoenzymes can be separated in less than 3 min, with a resulting dilution of the serum with no more than an equal volume of buffer. Without sample concentration or spectrofluorometric measurement, the procedure detects 4 U of MB isoenzyme per liter. Sensitivity is limited by the sensitivity and precision of the method of measurement. The CV for the fractionation can be held to less than 4.0% at 65 U of MB per liter. Current fractionation methods are compared to the proposed procedure. With use of a discrete analyzer (Du Pont aca) the mean MB activity in a population free of heart disease was 3.2 +/- 3.0 U/liter (range, 0 to 8 U/liter). The kinetics and stability of isolated isoenzymes are reported, indicating that advisability of storing or pre-incubating samples with mercaptoethanol.\n",
      "The dependence of tryptamine excretion on urinary pH. It is demonstrated that urinary tryptamine decreases significantly with increasing urinary pH. This effect becomes important at a urinary pH of 6.5 and over.\n",
      "A stabilising factor for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in urine. Urinary gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) has been found to be stable when stored at room temperature and 4 degrees C. Activity is lost rapidly when urine is frozen but prior dialysis will prevent this loss. Urea is the major factor responsible for the loss of activity; albumin is protective at concentrations of 6 g/l or more. A factor of 10 000-30 000 molecular weight which will prevent the loss of urinary gamma-GT activity on freezing has been found in serum and urine; it has high potency in serum and in urine from patients with chronic renal failure, but only low potency in normal urine. Its nature is unknown but it is heat stable.\n",
      "Properties of beta-glucuronidase activity in human synovial fluid. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the properties of beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) in human synovial fluid. It was shown to have a pH requirement of 5.0 and a KM value of about 8.0 - 10(-3) M using phenolphthalein beta-glucuronide as the substrate. At low substrate concentration an endogenous inhibitor is demonstrable. The inhibition is of the competitive type and is removed by proteolytic digestion of synovial fluid, whereas hyaluronidase digestion and addition either of Triton X-100 or of various salts to the assay mixture, are ineffective. The possibility that the inhibitor is a protein from serum is discussed.\n",
      "Glucose-phosphate isomerase deficiency due to a new variant (GP I Barcelona) and to a silent gene: biochemical, immunological and genetic studies. A 12-year-old girl of Spanish origin was found to be double heterozygote for a deficient GP I variant (GP I Barcelona) and for a silent GP I gene. The mother was heterozygote for GP I Barcelona and the father was heterozygote for the silent gene. GP I Barcelona was a fast variant (116%) with an increased isoelectric point (9.55), lability to heat and to urea, and shift of the pH curve towards the acidic pH. The other kinetic characteristics were normal. The ratio of enzymatic activity to immunological reactivity was normal in erythrocytes and white blood cells of the father and the mother but decreased to 75% of normal in blood cells of the daughter. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of GP I deficiency of this patient are discussed.\n",
      "Rosette formation by mouse lymphocytes. IV. Fc and C3 receptors occurring together and separately on T cells and other leucocytes. A method is described for detecting the simultaneous presence of Fc and C3 receptors on mouse spleen cells. A proportion of both T cells and non-T cells bear both receptors. Both T-cell and non-T-cell Fc receptors were blocked by aggregated mouse IgG2 to the same degree. C3, but not Fc, receptors were blocked by factors present in the serum of irradiated mice or mice undergoing graft-versus-host reaction. Thymocytes activated by injection into irradiated F1 hybrid mice, and thymocytes regenerating after irradiation and bone marrow injection, appeared to have increased Fc receptors. A general role for Fc and C3 receptors in T cell-B cell co-operation is suggested.\n",
      "Fluroxene toxicity induced by phenobarbital. Because of reports of fluroxene toxicity in man, the effect of phenobarbital treatment on the toxicity and metabolism of fluroxene was studied in 9 rhesus monkeys. Six monkeys that were exposed to a mean calculated alveolar fluroxene concentration of 5.8% for 4-hr periods up to a total of 16 hr showed no evidence of toxicity. Two animals were sacrificed after a single 4-hr exposure to obtain control measures of fluroxene metabolites in tissues. Four monkeys that had previously survived received exposures to fluroxene and 3 monkeys that had no exposure to fluroxene died during fluroxene anesthesia after treatment with phenobarbital (mean time, 3 hr). Toxicity was manifested by arterial hypotension, pulmonary edema, and arterial hypoxemia. Phenobarbital treatment enhanced production of fluroxene metabolites, including the highly toxic trifluoroethanol. Concentrations of trifluoroethanol in mixed-expired gas, blood, and urine, and of total nonvolatile fluorine in blood, urine, and tissues of animals treated with phenobarbital were 2 to 10 times as in control animals. The results suggest that the rhesus monkey is a valuable model for the study of fluroxene pharmacology and that inclusion of an enzyme-inducing challenge in the evaluation of potential toxicity of other anesthetics seems warranted.\n",
      "Plasma concentrations and the time-course of beta blockade due to propranolol. The effectiveness of intravenously administered propranolol in antagonizing the chronotropic effect of isoproterenol and exercise has been investigated, and has been found at all times to be a predictable function of its plasma concentrations according to the classical drug-receptor theory for competitive antagonism. The data show further that the relationship between effectiveness and time depends on the way in which antagonism is measured. If the dose ratio to isoproterenol (DR) is measured, then (DR-1) declines with time in parallel with drug concentration. On the other hand, if propranolol's effects are measured as percentage reduction in a given response, then this declines linearly with time, even though plasma concentrations decline exponentially. This fact explains why confusion has in the past arisen concerning the relationship of the duration of beta blockade and pharmacokinetic half-life.\n",
      "Evaluation of lorazepam and pentobarbital as surgical premedicants. Lorazepam, a new benzodiazepine, was compared with a standard surgical premedicant, pentobarbital. In a double-blind study in 128 patients, lorazepam, 2 and 4 mg, and pentobarbital, 50 and 100 mg, were given intravenously in a randomized sequence. Significant differences were noted; lorazepam was found to provide greater sedation, lack of recall, and greater antianxiety effect than pentobarbital. No significant adverse effects were noted following either drug. Vital signs remained stable.\n",
      "The renal elimination of procainamide. The question of pH or flow dependence for the renal elimination of procainamide (PCA) was studied under 4 conditions in each of 4 subjects. Each subject received 500 mg of PCA intravenously at weekly intervals while in a state of (1) acid load (NH4Cl) and water deprivation, (2) acid load and water excess, (3) alkali load (NaHCO3) and water deprivation, and (4) alkali load and water excess. Plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for PCA and N-acetyl PCA (NAPA) analysis. Urine flow rates varied markedly between the water deprivation and water excess states (approximately 1.2 vs 5 ml/min, respectively), and urine pH varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states (pH = ca 5 vs 8, respectively). Despite this marked variation, there were no significant changes in PCA renal clearance or 24-hr PCA or NAPA excretion. If passive diffusion of PCA were taking place, such flow and pH changes would have caused marked changes in PCA clearance were the pH partition hypothesis true. We therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of PCA in man and that there must be tubular secretion. The implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and pH.\n",
      "Seasonal variations in the composition of urine in relation to calcium stone-formation. 1. A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out on data derived from single 24 h urine collections from 246 male idiopathic calcium stone-formers. 2. The daily urine volume and pH and the exretions of calcium, oxalate, phosphate, creatinine and magnesium were related to the time of year when the urine was collected, and the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and octocalcium phosphate calculated for each month. 3. There were significant seasonal variations in the urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate, each showing a maximum during the summer months and a minimum in the winter. There was no significant seasonal variation in urinary pH, volume, creatinine, phosphate or magnesium. 4. There was a significant increase in the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and a trend towards higher saturation levels of octo-calcium phosphate in the summer. These changes were dependent only on the seasonal variation in urinary calcium and oxalate and not on urine volume. 5. A retrospective study of the seasonal incidence of stone episodes among these 246 stone-formers showed that the rate of stone passage per month was 50% higher in the summer than in the winter. There was no significant seasonal variation in the incidence of stones removed surgically.\n",
      "Problems of the pathogenesis, clinics, and therapy of panarteritis of the aorta and its branches. 138 patients with panarteritis of the aorta and its branches were examined, and the clinical and morphological findings were compared. The disease is more widespread than has been assumed so far, and is more frequent in young women. Localization of the process in the abdominal aorta with involvement (stenosis) of renal arteries causes renovascular hypertension, which often has a malignant course, especially with an ambilateral affection of renal arteries. In the treatment, repetitive therapeutic courses with corticosteroids and heparin are of fundamental importance. With an isolated affection, especially in renovascular hypertension and disturbances of cerebral circulation, surgical treatment is also indicated.\n",
      "Lorazepam and diazepam in the treatment of neurotic anxiety: a double-blind trial. Fifty-eight neurotic patients with intense anxiety were treated with either lorazepam or diazepam in a double blind between-patients trial. Statistical analysis indicated that the two groups were homogeneous before treatment and that the results of treatment were similar for both drugs. According to the global rating of illness week after week, after four weeks of treatment more patients on lorazepam than on diazepam were normal or had mild illness (82.1% vs. 70.8%). In the investigators' judgment, 71.9% of the patients treated with lorazepam had an excellent or good response compared with 56.7+ of those treated with diazepam. The mean reduction in score on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale was 17.7 for lorazepam and 16.5 for diazepam. However, none of the above differences in results were statistically significant. The largest dose of lorazepam required in treatment was 6 mg, compared with 30 mg of diazepam. Two patients treated with lorazepam had side effects, against six with diazepam. Six patients in the diazepam group did not complete the trial, including three who discontinued because of side effects (rash, tremors, agitation); no patients in the lorazepam group dropped out.\n",
      "Identification and urinary excretion of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide, a metabolite of iproclozide, in humans. The presence of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide was detected in the urine of man receiving iproclozide [1-(p-chlorophenoxyacetyl)-2-isopropylhydrazine]. This new metabolite was identified by combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and by comparison with the synthetic compound. An appropriate procedure for the extraction and quantitation of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide by gas-liquid chromatography on a 5% OV-225-packed column with the 2-butyl analog of iproclozide as an internal standard, has been developed. After 20- and 50-mg single dose oral administrations of iproclozide, 5.2 and 8.3% were slowly excreted in urine as p-chlorophenoxyacetamide within 30.5 and 36 hr. respectively. After 20-mg oral intakes by psychiatric patients, the 24-hr urinary excretion of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide amounted to about 2-4% of the iproclozide dose administered.\n",
      "Tissue metabolites of trifluorperazine, fluphenazine, prochlorperazine, and perphenazine. Kinetics in chronic treatment. Repeated oral treatment of male rats with piperazine-substituted phenothiazine drugs in doses of 25 mg/kg or more daily led to an accumulation of metabolites containing an ethylenediamine group instead of the piperazine ring. These products of ring degradation with and without removal of the N-alkyl group were found, together with the parent drugs and their N-dealkylated metabolites, in liver, lung, kidney, and spleen, as well as in brain when high doses were administered. After termination of treatment, the ethylenediamine derivatives were eliminated more slowly than were their congeners containing the intact piperazine ring. Parallel observations were made in dogs given fluphenazine in daily doses of up to 40 mg/kg. Quantitative differences were observed in the relative amounts of mono- and disubstituted ethylenediamine metabolites accumulated in rat tissues during treatment with the various drugs; the proportion of the monosubstituted product formed by N-dealkylation and ring cleavage declined in the following order: perazine, prochlorperazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine. Condensation products of the ethylenediamine derivatives with formaldehyde were split in the extraction procedure used.\n",
      "Physiological disposition and metabolism of 5-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)salicyclic acid, a new salicylate. 5-(2'4'-Difluorophenyl) [carboxy-14C]salicyclic acid (MK-647) was quickly and completely absorbed in rats, dogs, and man. Peak levels of plasma radioactivity occurred in 1-2 hr after oral administration. The dose was 10 mg/kg in rats and dogs, and 50 or 500 mg in man. Most of the drug in plasma was intact MK-647 which was extensively bound to plasma protein. In man the peak concentration following the 500-mg dose was approximately 10 times that after the lower dose, which suggests that absorption rates of both doses were similar. Elimination of drug from plasma was dose-dependent. The area under the curve for MK-647-14C in plasma was 18 times higher following the 500-mg dose than the 50-mg dose. Dogs given 10 mg/kg orally or intravenously excreted 44% of the dose in the urine and 42% in the feces in 72 hr. Rats given the same dose level by either route of administration excreted 80% in the urine and 11% in the feces. In man approximately 95% of a 50- or 500-mg oral dose was excreted in the urine and 3% in the feces, in 96 hr. MK-647 and two metabolites were present in the urine of three species. The ether and ester glucuronides were identified in human urine. The latter metabolite was also identified in rat and dog urine. The glycine conjugate of MK-647 was not observed in the urine of the three species. No interaction was observed between MK-647 and bishydroxycoumarin in the prothrombin time test nor with tolbutamide in the glucose tolerance test. A significant lowering of hexobarbital sleeping time was observed in female, but not male rats after four consecutive daily doses of MK-647. After repeated daily administration of MK-647 (12.5-100 mg/kg), the diurnal plasma level in dogs was not significantly altered, indicating that no saturation, induction, or inhibition of its own metabolism took place.\n",
      "Comparative biotransformation of triflubazam in rats, dogs, and monkeys. The biotransformation of 14C-triflubazam (ORF 8063; 1-methyl-5-phenyl-7-trifluoromethyl-1H-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-4-[3H,5H]-dione) was investigated in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Urinary metabolites, representing 65, 74, and 87%, respectively, of the total urinary radioactivity excreted by these three species, were isolated by preparative layer chromatography and characterized by various spectral techniques including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, solid probe mass spectrometry, polarimetry, and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. No parent drug was found in the urine of any species. Four metabolites were isolated from the rat including the 4'-hydroxyphenyl, dihydrodiol, and 3'-methoxy-4'hydroxy derivatives. N-demethylated metabolites were not isolated from rat urine. Five metabolites were isolated from dog urine, including 4-hydroxyphenyl, dihydrodiol, and catechol derivatives of triflubazam. Unlike the case of the rat, a catechol-O-methyl ether was not detected in dog urine. Six metabolites were isolated from monkey urine. The only major difference in metabolism in the monkey was the existence of both the dihydrodiol and N-desmethyldihydrodiol metabolites. No catechol-0-methyl ether was detected in monkey urine. Biotransformation through a common arene oxide intermediate can be proposed for these three animal species.\n",
      "N-hydroxyamobarbital: the second major metabolite of amobarbital in man. After oral administration of 14C-labeled amobarbital to healthy subjects, most of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and only 4-5% in feces over a period of 6 days. No unchanged amobarbital was excreted. Two major metabolites were found and isolated. One was 3'-hydroxyamobarbital, which has been previously identified by Maynert. The second could be identified as N-hydroxyamobarbital on the basis of its spectral and chemical properties.\n",
      "Spironolactone metabolism in man studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify metabolites of spironolactone in human blood and urine. In three healthy men about 20% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 24 hr after an oral dose of [20-3H]spironolactone (200 mg + 200 muCi). About half of this radioactivity was extracted with chloroform at pH 3 and from this extract four stable metabolites were isolated by use of column and thin-layer chromatography. Two of these were the previously identified metabolites, canrenone (VII; 2.9% of dose) and the 6beta-hydroxy-sulfoxide (X; 1.8% of the dose). The remaining were the new metabolites, 15alpha-hydroxycanrenone (XI; 0.8% of dose) and the 6beta-hydroxy-thiomethyl derivatives (VI; 0.5% of dose). The principal water-soluble urinary metabolite was canrenoate ester glucuronide (XII; 4.5% of dose). In the 24- to 32-hr pooled serum, canrenone (VII) was the principal metabolite in the organic-extractable fraction; VI was present in appreciable amounts but X and XI were present at extremely low levels.\n",
      "Correlation of 14C-griseofulvin metabolism in rat liver microsomes, isolated perfused rat livers, and in rats with bile duct cannulas. The metabolism of 14C-griseofulvin has been compared in rat liver microsomes, isolated perfused rat livers, and rats with bile duct cannulas. In all three preparations, 4-desmethylgriseofulvin and 6-desmethylgriseofulvin were the major metabolites. The ratio of total 4-desmethylgriseofulvin to 6-desmethylgriseofulvin formed was 1.20, 0.89, and 1.01 in liver microsomes, isolated perfused livers, and rats with bile duct cannulas, respectively. After a 7-min incubation with liver microsomes, most (96%) of the griseofulvin remained unchanged. Only small amounts of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (1.26%) of dose) and 6-desmethylgriseofulvin (1.05% of dose) were formed. In isolated perfused liver, most of the drug (59% of dose) was excreted into bile within 4 hr, primarily as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (24% of dose) and 6-methylgriseofulvin (24% of dose). In animals with bile duct cannulas, 65% of the dose was excreted into bile and 18% of the dose into urine within 4 hours. In bile, 32% of the dose was excreted as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin and 20% of the dose as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, whereas in urine the drug was excreated predominantly as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin (13% of dose) with only a small amount of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (1% of dose), during the first 4 hr. These results show that there is good correlation in the metabolic fate of 14C-griseofulvin in the liver microsomes, isolated perfused liver, and rats with bile duct cannulas. In addition to the similar ratio of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin to 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, there is also an agreement in the extent of metabolism and biliary excretion in isolated perfused liver and in rats with bile duct cannulas, which suggests that the isolated perfused liver is an important technique for studying drug metabolism in animals.\n",
      "Oxidative biotransformation of 2-acetylaminofluorene in fetal and placental tissues of humans and monkeys. Correlations with aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities. The mixed-function oxidation of 14C-labled 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) was investigated in placental and fetal tissues of humans and monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) in vitro. The major metabolite formed in most tissues was 7-hydroxy-AAF. Rates of the hydroxylation reactions varied widely among the tissues investigated and were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in rat hepatic tissues. High correlations among rates of 7-,5-, and 3- and between 1- and N-hydroxylations of AAF were observed. The latter two reactions were less responsive to inhibition by carbon monoxide. Rates of 3-hydroxylations of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) also were highly correlated with rates of 7-, 5-, and 3-hydroxylations of AAF but were not correlated with rates of 1- and N-hydroxylations in human placental microsomes. A lack of statistically significant correlations was observed among rates of many of these hydroxylation reactions studied in primate fetal tissues. Rates of 7-, 5-, and 3-hydroxylations of AAF were not statistically correlated with rates of 3-hydroxylation of BP in homogenates of primate fetal tissues in most instances, but statistically significant correlations among rates of 3-hydroxylation of BP and 1- and N-hydroxylations of AAF were observed in those preparations. The results suggested two separate mechanisms for the genetic control of rates of placental aromatic ring- and N-hydroxylation reactions as opposed to apparent multiple genetic controls for rates of these hydroxylation reactions in primate fetal tissues.\n",
      "Effect of 3-methylcholanthrene treatment on phenacetin O-dealkylation in several inbred mouse strains. An increase in the metabolism of phenacetin to N-acetyl-p-aminophenol is correlated with benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase induction by 3-methylcholanthrene among several inbred mouse strains. While the magnitude of induction of phenacetin O-dealkylation is considerably less than that of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation, the data indicate that in mice, the metabolism of these two substrates is under similar regulatory control.\n",
      "Further studies of metyrapone effects upon anilide hydroxylation. The enhancing effect of metyrapone upon the p-hydroxylation of acetanilide has been confirmed with the use of a new gas-chromatographic method for the determination of acetaminophen. This effect has been shown not to be due to inhibition of hydrolysis of acetaminophen or interference with its determination, or to preferential formation of other phenolic metabolites. This effect of metyrapone is remarkably substrate-specific: phenol formation from the homologues of acetanilide, formanilide and propionanilide, and that from the sulfonamide analog of acetanilide, methanesulfonanilide, is inhibited by metyrapone over the concentration range in which acetanilide hydroxylation is enhanced. The same substrate specificity was observed when the modifier was acetophenone. alpha,alpha'-Dipyridyl, however, enhances phenol formation from all three carbonacylanilides, but does not affect that from methanesulfonanilide.\n",
      "Nature and fate of insecticide residues inhaled by rats in cigarette smoke. Radioactive carbaryl, carbofuran, parathion, leptophos, and DDT were added to cigarettes and the mainstream smoke was directed to the lungs of rats via the trachea. Total radiocarbon transfer to the lungs ranged from 9 to 15% of that in the tobacco burned during a smoking process involving eight 5-ml puffs. Exhalation of 14C residues during this time was 24 to 30% of that inhaled with all insecticides except carbofuran, of which 42% of the residues was exhaled. After 5 hr, total exhalation of the consumed radiocarbon was 35% for parathion, 65% for carbofuran, and approximately 50% for the other products. The nature of the 14C residues inhaled, their urinary and fecal excretion, and their deposition in and dissipation from various organs and tissues are presented.\n",
      "Absorption and disposition of 2-[4-(2,2-dichlorocyclopropyl)phenoxy]-2-methylpropanoic acid, WIN 35,833, in rats, monkeys, and men. 2-[4-(2,2-Dichlorocyclopropyl)phenoxy]-2-methylpropanoic acid, Win 35,833, was readily absorbed after oral administration; in rats, rhesus monkeys, and human volunteers, peak concentrations of drug in plasma were attained within 2 hr of medication. The time-concentration curve of administered drug was biphasic in monkeys and men, while in rats the kinetics of a one-compartment model were observed. Distribution studies of 14C-labeled drug in the rat showed that most of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces and that significant quantities of 14C were sequestered by depot fat. Monkeys and human subjects both eliminated Win 35,833 primarily through the kidneys. The drug was excreted in rat bile and human urine, both as the free acid and conjugated with glucuronic acid. At physiological concentrations, Win 35,833 was extensively bound to rat, monkey, and human plasma proteins. A gas-chromatographic method for the analysis of drug in plasma, urine, or bile gave a linear relationship between peak height ratios and concentrations, in the range of 1-60 mug/ml.\n",
      "The gastrointestinal absorption of methadone in the rat. The absorption of dl-methadone from the gastrointestinal tract of the Sprague-Dawley rat was examined by the in vivo segment technique. Duodenal absorption, measured as a function of time and dose, followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 15.6 min. Absorption was not influenced by prior or concomitant administration of a variety of drugs. Absorption from other regions of the intestine was similar to that from the duodenum; in contrast, absorption from the stomach was markedly slower. Gastric absorption was increased by alkalinization of stomach contents but was still considerably slower than from the duodenum. Gastric emptying of methadone appears to be the rate-limiting step in the overall gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, since the rate of emptying following intubation of the drug into the stomach was also considerably slower than the rate of duodenal absorption.\n",
      "Biliary excretion of colchicine in newborn rats. The 24-hr LD50 of colchicine in newborn rats is 0.24 mg/kg, which is about 1/10 that observed in the adult. The 24-hr LD50 of colchicine was relatively constant in rats over 25 days of age. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of the increased sensitivity of the newborn rat to the toxic action of colchicine, the distribution of 3H after the administration of 3H-colchicine (0.1 mg/kg) was measured in 10- and 35-day-old rats. The concentration of 3H was higher in all tissues of the newborn than the adult after ip administration, suggesting an immaturity in the pathway for colchicine elimination. After iv administration, radioactivity disappeared much more slowly from the plasma of the newborn rat than from the adult. This was due to a lower capacity of the liver of the newborn to concentrate colchicine and to excrete it into the bile. Development of the hepatic excretory mechanism responsible for excretion of colchicine occurred at the same age as did the increase in LD50. These results suggest that colchicine is more toxic in the newborn because the drug remains in the body for a longer time due to immaturity of the liver excretory process.\n",
      "Disposition in rats of a polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene copolymer used in plasma fractionation. A polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymer of about 4750 daltons (Poloxamer 108, Pluronic F-38) used in a new protein fractionation procedure may be infused into patients receiving therapeutic plasma fractions. We studied the disposition and pharmacokinetics of Poloxamer 108 in rats as an initial step towards understanding its behavior in man. After iv administration in rats, about 94% of 7 or 100 mg/kg doses of ethylene-14C-labeled polymer was excreted in the urine in 3 days. About 6% of the label appeared in feces. Erythrocyte membranes were not permeable to the polymer, and only the parent compound was demonstrable in urine. Twenty hours after dosing, small residues were detectable only in the kidney, liver, small intestine, and carcass. The third phase of the plasma disappearance pattern was evident only at the larger dose, but plasma disappearance kinetics were independent of the dose in the range used here. Thus, most of poloxamer 108 was eliminated rapidly in rats by renal excretion, and a smaller portion probably was removed by biliary excretion. These results will be applied to continuing studies of Poloxamer 108 disposition in man.\n",
      "Uptake and disposition of aldrin and dieldrin by isolated perfused rabbit lung. The uptake, metabolism, and release of aldrin and dieldrin by the lungs were studied by use of isolated perfused rabbit lungs that were artificially ventilated and perfused through the pulmonary artery. Both recirculating and single-pass experiments were conducted using an artificial medium as perfusate. Aldrin accumulated in the lung from the perfusate through two distinct phases of uptake: a rapid phase involving simple diffusion and nonspecific binding and a slower phase representing its metabolic turnover as dieldrin. Dieldrin was not metabolized but accumulated in the lungs by a saturable and a nonsaturable process. Single-pass experiments with aldrin indicated that the initial velocity of uptake could be fitted to one component and a constant representing the rate of metabolism. Uptake of dieldrin was biphasic: one phase independent of the perfusate concentration and the other saturable with respect to the perfusate concentration. By the application of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the maximum amount of dieldrin accumulation attributable to the saturable component was calculated to be 0.64 mumol/lung. Our results indicate that the accumulation of these chlorinated xenobiotics takes place through the processes of simple diffusion followed by nonspecific tissue binding. There was no evidence for irreversible binding of aldrin or dieldrin, its epoxide, in the lung. While the lung plays a role in metabolizing aldrin to dieldrin followed by a transient storage, neither substrate has the potential for long-term storage in the lung.\n",
      "Kinetic and spectral studies of type I and type II compounds with rat hepatic microsomes in the presence of the major metabolite of diphenylhydantoin. The nature of the inhibitory effects of the major metabolite of diphenylhydantoin, 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), on the in vitro metabolism of ethylmorphine and aniline by rat hepatic microsomes was examined. The N-demethylation of ethylmorphine was competitively inhibited by HPPH, whereas inhibition of the hydroxylation of aniline was not competitive. The spectrum produced by HPPH when added to microsomal suspensions does not resemble the classical type I or type II spectra, but rather a reversed type I spectrum. Spectral evidence is presented indicating that HPPH also diminishes the magnitude of the spectral change produced by type I and II compounds.\n",
      "Change in the kinetics of sulphacetamide tissue distribution in Walker tumor-bearing rats. The effect of Walker tumor on sulphacetamide distribution was studied in rats 21 days after tumor implantation in a hind leg. After oral administration of sulphacetamide (5 and 20 min), the concentration of the drug was found to be lower in the plasma and liver of tumor-bearing rats when compared with that of control group. However, 90 min after sulphacetamide administration, the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumor-bearing rats than in control animals. Whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the brain, drug concentrations in the fat tissue of tumor-bearing rats were constantly higher than those of control animals. These changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Contrary to what was observed after oral administration, constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats after iv injection of sulphacetamide. Furthermore, the half-life of sulphacetamide in these same animals was much higher than in control animals. It is concluded that, in Walker tumor-bearing rats, there are changes in the kinetics of sulphacetamide which are functions of the route of administration of the drug.\n",
      "Cytochrome P-450 measurement in rat liver homogenate and microsomes. Its use for correction of microsomal losses incurred by differential centrifugation. Cytochrome P-450 was assayed in rat liver homogenates and microsomes in order to calculate microsomal recoveries and correct for losses during ultracentrifugation or sedimentation in presence of CaCl2. The values obtained for corrected microsomal protein in untreated female Sprague-Dawley rats were between 40 and 50 mg/g of liver. The assay of cytochrome P-450 in liver homogenate is accurate enough to calculate a reproducible recovery factor. The value of the method lies in its rapidity, its capacity to correct over a wide range of losses, and its capacity to yield reliable values of the total microsomal protein mass. The limits of this method include overestimation of homogenate cytochrome P-450 and inability to correct for nonmicrosomal protein contamination. Overestimation of cytochrome P-450 can be corrected by measuring the difference in absorbance between 450 and 510 nm with the extinction coefficient of 100 mM-1cm-1. To be accurate, cytochrome P-450 determination on microsomes must be done at protein concentrations of about 3 mg/ml. The error inherent to the method may be kept constant and minimal. The use of correction for microsomal losses is recommended in order to obtain uniformity between results from various laboratories and adequate correlation with in vivo studies of microsomal functions.\n",
      "Identification of \"big\" human placental lactogen in placenta and serum. Because of increasing evidence for the heterogeneity of polypeptide hormones, studies of the molecular species of human placental lactogen (hPL) were initiated. When extracts of freshly delivered human placentas were passed over Sephadex G-100 in 0.05M ammonium carbonate, three immunoreactive peaks were detected. In addition to a peak corresponding to native hPL (Kav = 0.39) and one in the void volume, a consistent peak which eluted before hPL (Kav = 0.20) was present. The latter represented 2-25% of total hormonal activity and could be rerun without significant conversion to hPL. In 8M urea, the peak continued to behave as a large molecular weight form on both Sephadex chromatography and on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Extraction procedures at both neutral and alkaline pH produced similar quantities of the larger material. [125I]iodo-hPL was not converted to the larger form by the conditions of extraction or analysis. These properties are consistent with a larger molecular weight, non-aggregated form of hPL. In comparison with the native hormone, the idsplacement curves for the larger form were parallel in radioimmunoassay studies. Sera obtained from pregnant women during various stages of gestation also showed consistent evidence for a large molecular weight form of the hormone. These observations provide direct evidence, both in placental tissue and in serum for \"big\" hPL.\n",
      "The water-to-air transfer of 35SO4= by bursting bubbles. The transfer of 35SO4= from water to air by bursting bubbles was studied as a function of three levels each of three variables in a bubbling solution. The variables were pH, surfactant concentration, and Na2 35SO4 concentration. One combination of the above variables was also studied at three different temperatures. Sterile water solutions containing different combinations of the above factors and a fixed amount of 22NaCl were bubbled in an enclosure for 1 hour. After bubbling, samples of the aerosol produced, the larger drops that fell out of the air, and the bulk solution were collected and assayed for their 35S and 22Na content using liquid scintillation counting. The 35S/22Na enrichment for each droplet sample as compared to the ratio for the bulk solution was determined, and it was found to be dependent upon the combination of the factor levels being bubbled. Both positive and negative enrichments were found, with large positive enrichments being found consistently only for the highest value of surfactant concentration. The temperature study showed no significant enrichment differences for any of the three temperatures studied.\n",
      "Differential effects of phenobarbital and pentobarbital on isolated nervous tissue. Epileptiform after discharges evoked by repetitive electrical stimulation of chronically isolated cortical slabs (cat) were shortened by low doses of phenobarbital but not affected by hypnotic doses of pentobarbital. Both pentobarbital and phenobarbital raised threshold and lowered spike amplitude in isolated sciatic nerves. The action of both drugs was increased by reducing Na in the medium and by decreasing the Ringer's pH. Similar to the action of other general anesthetics, the axonal effect of pentobarbital was enhanced by D2O replacement for H2O in the Ringer's (suggesting that tissue water is involved in pentobarbital action), whereas D2O replacement did not modify the action of phenobarbital or of local anesthetics. These results suggest that the varying in vivo effects of pentobarbital and phenobarbital may be due to a difference in their action upon excitable membranes (rather than to a different regional distribution in brain).\n",
      "The reaction of horse-liver alcohol dehydrogenase with glyoxal. Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was reacted with glyoxal at different pH values ranging from 6.0 to 9.0. At pH 9.0 the enzyme undergoes a rapid activation over the first minutes of reaction, followed by a decline of activity, which reaches 10% of that of the native enzyme. Chemical analysis of the inactivated enzyme after sodium borohydride reduction shows that 11 argi-ine and 11 lysine residues per mole are modified. At pH 7.7 the enzyme activity increases during the first hour of the reaction with glyoxal and then decreases slowly. Chemical analysis shows that 4 arginine and 3 lysine residues per mole are modified in the enzyme at the maximum of activation. At pH 7.0 the enzyme undergoes a 4-fold activation. Chemical analysis shows that in this activated enzyme 3 lysine and no arginine residues per mole have been modified. Steady-state kinetic analysis suggests that the activated enzyme is not subjected to substrate inhibition and that its Michaelis constant for ethanol is three times larger than that of the native enzyme. The possible role of arginine and lysine residues in the catalytic function of liver alcohol dehydrogenase is discussed.\n",
      "The conformational oscillation of delta-chymotrypsin involvement of methionine-192. In delta-chymotrypsin the reactivity of methionine-192 towards p-nitrophenacyl bromide is strongly reduced when the alpha-amino group of isoleucine-16 has been acetylated. Since acetylation of isoleucine-16 brings delta-chymotrypsin to a conformation similar to its alkaline one this suggests that methionine-192 should present an impaired reactivity in the alkaline conformation of the protein. It is indeed observed that its chemical reactivity as a function of pH depends on the ionization state of the alpha-amino group of isoleucine-16 (pKapp 9 at 15 degrees C) as does the structure of the enzyme. Reciprocally, after chemical reaction of methionine-192 with hydrogen peroxide, isoleucine-16 presents a slower rate of reaction with fluorescamine than when methionine-192 is free. As a result of methionine-192 oxidation the apparent pK of the alkaline transition is shifted from 9 to about 11 at 15 degrees C. This is reflected in the disappearance of the lag phase previously observed for the initial activity of the enzyme when it is incubated at alkaline pH [Eur. J. Biochem. (1973) 39,293-300]. The absence of chemical reactivity of methionine-192 in the alkaline state of the enzyme is confirmed by the appearance of a lag phase in the reaction of the protein with iodoacetate after an incubation at alkaline pH. Such a lag phase does not appear when this incubation is carried out at neutral pH. Since this lag phase is similar to that which shows up in the activity during the isomerization of the enzyme from its alkaline to its neutral state, the present data are interpreted as implying a concerted movement of isoleucine-16 and methionine-192 during this isomerization process. They also indicate that in the alkaline form of the enzyme methionine-192 has moved back into the interior of the protein. Since the spectroscopic properties of the zymogen and of the high-pH form of the enzyme are similar they suggest that methionine-192 occupies in the alkaline conformation of the enzyme a similar position as it does in the zymogen.\n",
      "Investigations on the kinetic mechanism of octopine dehydrogenase. 1. Steady-state kinetics. The kinetic mechanism of action of octopine dehydrogenase was investigated. This enzyme catalyses the reversible dehydrogenation of D-octopine to L-arginine and pyruvate, in the presence of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies were carried out in both directions. Most of the results are consistent with a bi-ter sequential mechanism where NAD+ binds first to the enzyme followed by D-octopine, and the products are released in the order L-arginine, pyruvate and NADH. Various kinetic parameters were determined for each reactant at 33 degrees C, at pH 9.6 for NAD reduction, at pH 6.6 for NADH oxidation.\n",
      "The catalytic mechanism of carbonic anhydrase. Hydrogen-isotope effects on the kinetic parameters of the human C isoenzyme. 1. The steady-state kinetics of the interconversion of CO2 and HCO3 catalyzed by human carbonic anhydrase C was studied using 1H2O and 2H2O as solvents. The pH-independent parts of the parameters k(cat) and Km are 3-4 times larger in 1H2O than in 2H2O for both directions of the reaction, while the ratios k(cat)/Km show much smaller isotope effects. With either CO2 or HCO3 as substrate the major pH dependence is observed in k(cat), while Km appears independent of pH. The pKa value characterizing the pH-rate profiles is approximately 0.5 unit larger in 2H2O than in 1H2O. 2. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate catalyzed by human carbonic anhudrase C is approximately 35% faster in 2H2O than in 1H2O. In both solvents the pKa values of the pH-rate profiles are similar to those observed for the CO2-HCO3 interconversion. 3. It is tentatively proposed that the rate-limiting step at saturating concentrations of CO2 or HCO3 is an intramolecular proton transfer between two ionizing groups in the active site. It cannot be decided whether the transformation between enzyme-bound CO2 and HCO3 involves a proton trnasfer or not.\n",
      "Purification and properties of isoenzymes of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase from soybean-cell-suspension cultures. Two isoenzymes of an NADP+ -dependent cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and an NAD+ - dependent aliphatic alcohol dehydrogenase were extracted from cell suspension cultures of soybean (Glycine max L., var. Mandarin) which form lignin during growth. These enzymes could be separated from each other by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite. The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes were partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-100, and hydroxyapatite. The molecular weight of the enzymes were estimated by the elution volumes from a Sephadex G-100 column and were found to be about 43,000 (isoenzyme 1) and 69,000 (isoenzyme 2). Maximum rates of reaction were observed in the case of coniferyl alcohol oxidation at pH 9.2 (Isoenzyme 1) and pH 8.8 (isoenzyme 2); in the reverse reaction pH 6.5 was optimal for isoenzyme 2. Whereas isoenzyme 1 is specific for coniferyl alcohol, isoenzyme 2 can also oxidize cinnamyl alcohol and a number of substituted cinnamyl alcohols, Km values for substituted cinnamaldehydes are 3-11 times lower than for the corresponding alcohols. Neither isoenzyme reacted with benzyl alcohol, anisic alcohol or ethanol. Substrate inhibition for the forward and reverse reaction was found with isoenzyme 2 but not with isoenzyme 1. The equilibrium constant was determined to be about 10(9) in favour of coniferaldehyde reduction. The possible role of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in lignin biosynthesis is discussed.\n",
      "The pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex from Azotobacter vinelandii. 2. Regulation of the activity. The presence of activators(AMP and sulphate) or inhibitors(acetyl-CoA) has no influence on the Hill coefficient of the S-shaped [pyruvate]--velocity curve of either the pyruvate-NAD+ overall reaction(h equals 2.5) or that of the pyruvate-K3Fe(CN)6 ACTIVITY OF THE FIRST ENZYME (H EQUALs 1.3). pH STUDIES INDICATED THAT THE Hill coefficient is dependent on subunit ionization within the pyruvate-containing complex and not on those in the free complex. It is concluded that pyruvate conversion rather that pyruvate binding is responsible for the allosteric pattern. The activity is due to absence of a protein kinase, mainly regulated at the acetyl-CoA/CoA, and NADH/NAD+ levels and by the value of the energy charge.\n",
      "Arginine decarboxylase from Lathyrus sativus seedlings. Purification and properites. Arginine decarboxylase which makes its appearance in Lathyrus sativus seedlings after 24 h of seed germination reaches its highest level around 5-7 days, the cotyledons containing about 60% of the total activity in the seedlings at day 5. The cytosol enzyme was purified 977-fold from whole seedlings by steps involving manganese chloride treatment, ammonium sulphate and acetone fractionations, positive adsorption on alumina C-gamma gel, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography followed by preparative disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by electrophoretic and immunological criteria, had a molecular weight of 220,000 and appears to be a hexamer with identical subunits. The optimal pH and temperature for the enzyme activity were 8.5 and 45 degrees C respectively. The enzyme follows typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 1.73 mM for arginine. Though Mn2+ at lower concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity, there was no dependence of the enzyme on any metal for the activity. The arginine decarboxylase of L. sativus is a sulfhydryl enzyme. The data on co-factor requirement, inhibition by carbonyl reagents, reducing agents and pyridoxal phosphate inhibitors, and a partial reversal by pyridoxal phosphate of inhibition by pyridoxal-HCl suggests that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is involved as a co-factor for the enzyme. The enzyme activity was inhibited competitively by various amines including the product agmatine. Highest inhibition was obtained with spermine and arcain. The substrate analogue, L-canavanine, homologue L-homoarginine and other basic amino acids like L-lysine and L-ornithine inhibited the enzyme activity competitively, homoarginine being the most effective in this respect.\n",
      "Yeast hexokinase A. Succinylation and properties of the active subunit. Yeast hexokinase A (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.1.1) dissociates into its subunits upon reaction with succinic anhydride. The chemically modified subunits could be isolated in a catalytically active form. The Km values found for ATP and for glucose were of the some order as those found for the native enzyme. Of the 37 amino groups present per enzyme subunit, 2-3 of these groups might be located in the proximity of the region of subunit interactions. The 50% loss of the initial activity, which follows the succinylation of these more reactive amino groups, does not seem to be due to the modification of a residue on the enzyme active site or to a change of the tertiary structure of the protein. This 50%loss of the enzyme activity may be related to the dissociation of the dimer into monomers. Both native enzyme and the succinylated subunits have the same H-dependent denaturation rate profiles in response to 2 M urea. Moreover, the apparent pK of the group involved in the transition from a more stable conformation of the protein in the acid range to a less stable one at alkaline pH seems to be similar to the pK of the group implicated in the transition between the protonated inactive form of the enzyme and an active deprotonated form. The succinylated subunit presents 'negative co-operativity' with respect to ATP at slightly acid pH; however, the burst-type slow transient in the reaction progress curve and the activation effect induced by physiological polyanions, effects observed for the native enzyme, were not detected in the standard experimental conditions with the succinylated subunit.\n",
      "The renaturation of reduced polyalanyl-chymotrypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Chymotrypsinogen has been successfully renatured in solution, after reduction of its 5 disulfide bonds in 6 M guanidine-HCl. This has been made possible by the study of the renaturation of a model derivative, polyalanyl-chymotrypsinogen. The reduced derivative is shown to refold and reoxodize spontaneously, with a 30-40% yield, into molecules which are monomeric and fully susceptible to activation by trypsin. Chymotrypsinogen can also be renatured but only in the presence of reagents allowing disulfide interchange and of moderate concentrations of guanidine-HCl or urea. These results illustrate how the kinetic trapping of incorrectly folded molecules by wrong S-S bonds and aggregation can be overcome, thus allowing the correct refolding of the protein.\n",
      "Further studies on lipid-peroxide formation in isolated hepatocytes. Lipid peroxide formation was initiated by the addition of either ADP-complexed Fe3+ or cumene hydroperoxide to a suspension of isolated hepatocytes. The reaction was monitored by malonaldehyde measurements. Upon the addition of iron, malonaldehyde production in the cells started immediately but ceased within 30-60 min, and the response was dose-related with iron concentrations ranging from 19 to 187 muM. Malonaldehyde formation was associated with increased oxygen uptake and conjugated diene production. The addition in vitro of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, menadione or p-benzoquinone inhibited the iron-induced malonaldehyde production. It was also possible to demonstrate an apparent disappearance of malonaldehyde from fresh cells by addition of adequate amounts of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (100 muM). The attenuation of the iron-induced malonaldehyde production was found to be correlated with an increased binding of iron to an intracellular ferritin fraction. Further, malonaldehyde formation was also associated with a conversion of reduced glutathione to the oxidized form which, in turn, revealed a faster permeation out of the cells into the surrounding medium of the oxidized than of the reduced thiol. So, concomitant with the redox alterations, there was also an overall loss of glutathione from the cells. Cumene hydroperoxide-induced malonaldehyde production could be initiated by the addition of this peroxide in concentrations ranging from 150 muM to the liver cell incubate. With concentrations below 150 muM, a lag phase was present which seemed to be glutathione-dependent. It is concluded that iron enters the cell, then is probably reduced inside the cell by NADPH via the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and in the reduced state initiates lipid peroxidation. The reaction is inhibited by intracellular mechanisms, the glutathione redox system being of principal importance, and possibly terminated by the iron-apoferritin complex formation.\n",
      "On the mechanism of ketogenesis and its control. Purification, kinetic mechanism and regulation of different forms of mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases from ox liver. 1. Two mitochondrial forms of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases designated as enzyme A and enzyme B were crystallized from ox liver. They could be shown to be homogenous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2. In direction of acetoacetyl-CoA cleavage enzyme A shows a double competitive substrate inhibition when acetoacetyl-CoA is varied at different fixed CoA concentrations. With enzyme B a parallel kinetic pattern is obtained when acetoacetyl-CoA is varied at different fixed CoA concentrations. In direction of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis both enzymes show linear reciprocal plots of initial velocities against acetyl-CoA concentrations in absence of CoA. These initial velocity kinetics in the forward and in the reverse direction are in accordance with a ping-pong mechanism of reaction for both enzymes involving an acetyl-S-enzyme as intermediate. 3. Under saturating concentrations of substrate, the ratios of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis/aceto-acetyl-CoA cleavage is 0.31 for enzyme A and 0.08 for enzyme B. The maximum velocity in direction of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis of enzymes A and B are 0.43 mumol X min-1 X unit thiolase-1 and 0.10 mumol X min-1 X unit thiolase-1, respectively. 4. Both enzymes show nearly the same affinity for acetyl-CoA. The Km values are 91 muM (enzyme A) and 80 muM (enzyme B). 5. Coenzyme A and acetoacetyl-CoA both act as inhibitors in direction of acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis: coenzyme A is a nonlinear competitive inhibitor of both enzymes. Acetoacetyl-CoA exerts a negative cooperativity on enzyme A (nH = 0.63) and is a competitive inhibitor for enzyme B (Ki = 1.6 muM). 6. The catalytic and regulatory properties of the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases A and B are discussed in terms of their proposed role in regulating ketogenesis. Intracellular fluctuations of acetoacetyl-CoA/3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA ratios, resulting in a suspension of inhibition of both enzymes at high NADH/NAD ratios, are postulated as a control mechanism of ketogenesis in addition to mechanisms already known.\n",
      "D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Entner-Doudoroff enzyme) from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Purification, properties and regulation. 1. The existence of two different D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases in Pseudomonas fluorescens has been demonstrated. Based on their different specificity and their different metabolic regulation one enzyme is appointed to the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the other to the hexose monophosphate pathway. 2. A procedure is described for the isolation of that D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase which forms part of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (Entner-Doudoroff enzyme). A 950-fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of 44%. The final preparation, having a specific activity of about 300 mumol NADH formed per min per mg protein, was shown to be homogeneous. 3. The molecular weight of the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme has been determined to be 220000 by gel permeation chromatography, and that of the other enzyme (Zwischenferment) has been shown to be 265000. 4. The pI of the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme has been shown to be 5.24 and that of the Zwischenferment 4.27. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme is stable in the range of pH 6 to 10.5 and shows its maximal activity at pH 8.9. 5. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme showed specificity for NAD+ as well as for NADP+ and exhibited homotropic effects for D-glucose 6-phosphate. It is inhibited by ATP which acts as a negative allosteric effector. Other nucleoside triphosphates as well as ADP are also inhibitory. 6. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the axial hydrogen at carbon-1 of beta-D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate to the si face of carbon-4 of the nicotinamide ring and must be classified as B-side stereospecific dehydrogenase.\n",
      "Purification and properties of potato 1,4-alpha-D-glucan:1,4-alpha-D-glucan 6-alpha-(1,4-alpha-glucano)-transferase. Evidence against a dual catalytic function in amylose-branching enzyme. Q-Enzyme, the enzyme that synthesizes the 1,6-alpha-glucosidic branch linkages of amylopectin, has been purified from potato to near homogeneity. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 85000. The active enzyme is a monomer, with a molar activity at pH 7.0 and 24 degrees C of 15. The energy of activation is 25 kJ/mol below 15 degrees C, changing sharply to 63 kJ/mol above that temperature. Enzyme activity is not affected by Mg2+ or ATP. There are about 11 readily titratable sulfhydryl groups per molecule. The evidence that the enzyme is a single protein entity, without hydrolytic activity towards amylose, contrasts with an earlier report that Q-enzyme consists of two components, a hydrolase with molecular weight 70000, and a transferase with molecular weight 20000. Q-enzyme acts on native and synthetic amyloses to give products resembling amylopectin in terms of average unit chain length, degress of beta-amylolysis and iodine stain. The profiles of the unit chains of these synthetic products are, however, different from that of native amylopectin. Additional branch linkages are introduced by Q-enzyme into potato amylopectin, but the product bears no resemblance to phytoglycogen.\n",
      "Factors affecting the molecular structure and the agglutinating ability of concanavalin A and other lectins. Ultracentrifugation analyses were performed on lectins under varying conditions of pH, ionic strength and temperature. It has been demonstrated that the phytohemagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris, the wheat germ agglutinin and the soybean agglutinin are stable when these parameters are varied, whereas the concanavalin A molecule exhibits a striking reversible dimer-tetramer transition with variation in pH (from 6.0 to 7.2) and temperature (from 4 degrees up to 37 degrees C). It has also been demonstrated that, in agglutination experiments undertaken at different temperatures, cells do eventually aggregate with the first three lectins provided that incubation time is sufficient, whereas the concanavalin-A-induced agglutination was previously found to be temperature-sensitive. These results strongly suggest that the effect of temperature on agglutination by lectins may essentially be due to a structural transition of the lectin itself and nott only to modification of cell surface properties.\n",
      "Axoplasm chemical composition in Myxicola and solubility properties of its structural proteins. The chemical composition of axoplasm extracted from the giant axon of Myxicola infundibulum has been analysed, and some of the factors which disperse its gel structure have been identified. 2. The axoplasm contains about 3-6% protein, and 0-12% lipid. It is isosmotic with sea water and has a pH near 7-0. 3. Inorganic ions in extracted axoplasm include: Na+, 13m-mole/kg wet wtl; K+, 280; Cl-, 24; Ca2+, 0-3; Mg2+, 3. 4. Free organic ions in axoplasm include: gly, 180 m-mole/kg wet st.; cysteic acid, 120; asp, 75; glu, 10; ala, 7; tau, 5; thr, 2; gln and ser, trace; homarine, 63; isethionate, 0. 5. The gel structure is dispersed by solutions containing 1--10 mM-Ca2+, because this ion activates an endogenous protease. The gel can also be dispersed without proteilysis by solutions containing 0-5 M-KCl, or 0-5 M guanidine hydrochloride, or 3-5 M urea, all of which break down neurofilaments. 6. It is argued that many aspects of the composition and dispersal properties of Myxicola axoplasm are similar to those in other axons.\n",
      "The metabolism of cyclohexanol by Acinetobacter NCIB 9871. Acinetobacter NCIB 9871 was isolated by elective culture on cyclohexanol and grows with this compound as sole source of carbon. It displays a restricted growth spectrum, being unable to grow on a wide range of alternative alicyclic alcohols and ketones. Cyclohexanol-grown cells oxidize the growth substrate at a rate of 230 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt with the consumption of 5.65 mumol of O2/mumol substrate. Cyclohexanone is oxidized at a similar rate with the consumption of 4.85 mumol of O2/mumol. 1-Oxa-2-oxocycloheptane and 6-hydroxyhexanoate are both oxidized at the same slow rate of 44 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt and adipate is not oxidized. Studies with cell extracts reveal the presence of inducible dehydrogenases for cyclohexanol, 6-hydroxyhexanoate and 6-oxohexanoate and a monooxygenase, that in conjunction with a lactonase converts cyclohexanone to 6-hydroxyhexanoate. The monooxygenase is therefore presumed to be of the lactone-forming type and the pathway for conversion of cyclohexanol to adipate; cyclohexanol leads to cyclohexanone leads to 1-oxa-2-oxocycloheptane leads to 6-hydroxyhexanoate leads to 6-oxohexanoate leads to adipate; for which key intermediates have been identified chromatographically, is identical with the route for the oxidation of cyclohexanol by Nocardia globerula CL1.\n",
      "Multiple forms of human glutathione S-transferase and their affinity for bilirubin. The initial enzymic step in mercapturic acid formation is catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase. Several species of this enzyme, designated as transferases alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon on the basis of increasing isoelectric points, were isolated from human liver. Evidence is presented that each of the purified species is homogeneous with respect to sodium dodecylsulfate-gel electrophoresis. Transferases alpha, beta and epsilon each appear as a single band on gel electrofocusing; transferases gamma and delta are present as two and three bands, respectively, with each band catalytically active. Amino acid analysis indicated the five transferases to be either very closely related or identical in this respect. All enzyme species have a molecular weight of about 48500 and consist of two apparently identical subunits. The spectrum of substrates is the same for each although the enzymes differ slightly in specific activity. As is the case for the rat liver enzymes, each of the human transferases binds bilirubin although this compound is not a substrate.\n",
      "Hydrophobic interaction determined by partition in aqueous two-phase systems. Partition of proteins in systems containing fatty-acid esters of poly(ethylene glycol). In this report we describe a new method which is useful for measuring hydrophobic interactions between aliphatic hydrocarbon chains and proteins in aqueous environment. The method is based on partition of proteins in an aqueous two-phase system containing dextran and poly(ethylene glycol) and different fatty acid esters of poly(ethylene glycol). The partition is measured under conditions where contributions from electrostatic interactions are eliminated. The difference in partition of proteins in phase systems with and without hyrocarbon groups bound to poly(ethylene glycol), deltalog K, where K is the partition coefficient, is taken as a measure of hydrophobic interaction. Deltalog K varies with size of hydrocarbon chain and type of protein. The length of the aliphatic chain should be greater than 8 carbon atoms in order to get a measurable effect in terms of deltalog K. Bovine serum albumin, beta-lactoglobulin, hemoglobin and myoglobin have been shown to have different affinities for palmitic acid ester of poly(ethylene glycol). No hydrophobic effect could be observed for ovalbumin, cytochrome c or alpha-chymotrypsinogen A.\n",
      "Spin-labelled phosphofructokinase. A simple and direct approach to the study of allosteric equilibria under near-physiological conditions. Rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase, spin-labelled at its most reactive thiol group, has an electron spin resonance spectrum which is very sensitive to the binding of substrates and allosteric effectors. The spectral changes have been interpreted in terms of a concerted allosteric transition between two conformational states with non-exclusive binding of effectors. On this basis MgATP, fructose 6-phosphate plus ATP, and NH+4ions behave as potent positive effectors, inorganic phosphate, sulphate, AMP, fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate are less potent activators, and free ATP and H+ions are negative effectors, in agreement with the kinetic behaviour, but citrate behaves anomalously. In addition, the allosteric equilibrium can be displaced towards the inhibited state by selectively modifying two further thiol groups. Strong positive cooperativity occurs under suitable conditions with ATP, metal-ATP and fructose 6-phosphate. Biphasic changes of conformation, attributed to binding at the catalytic and inhibitory sites, have been observed in titrations with ATP. The differentiation of the two ATP binding sites arises in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate because of a distinct concerted effect on conformation between the two substrates at the active site. A similar effect occurs between ATP and citrate. Other heterotropic effects are more consistent with simple models; phosphates favour the binding, and reduce the cooperativity, of fructose 6-phosphate and metal-ATP, whereas excess ATP and H+ ions antagonise the binding and increase the cooperativity of fructose 6-phosphate. The observations are related to existing kinetic and binding studies where possible. Anomalous features of the behaviour suggest that the model should be regarded only as a first approximation.\n",
      "Cytochrome c interaction with membranes. Absorption and emission spectra and binding characteristics of iron-free cytochrome c. A cytochrome c derivative from which iron is removed has been prepared and characterized. Several lines of evidence indicate that native and porphyrin cytochrome c have similar conformations: they have similar elution characteristics on Sephadex gel chromatography; in both proteins the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched and the pK values of protonation of the porphyrin are identical. Porphyrin cytochrome c does not substitute for native cytochrome c in either the oxidase reaction or in restoring electron transport in cytochrome-c-depleted mitochondria. It does however competitively inhibit native cytochrome c in these reactions, the Ki for inhibition being larger than the Km for reaction. The absorption and emission spectra, and the polarized excitation spectrum of the porphyrin cytochrome c are characteristic of free base porphyrin. The absence of fluorescence quenching of porphyrin cytochrome c  when the protein is bound to cytochrome oxidase suggests that heme to heme distance between these proteins is larger than 0.5 to 0.9 nm depending upon orientation. Binding of the porphyrin cytochrome c to phospholipids or to mitochondria increases the fluorescence polarization of a positively polarized absorption band, which indicates that the bound form of the protein does not rotate freely within the time scale of relaxation from the excited state.\n",
      "The trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors in chick peas (Cicer arietinum L.). Purification and properties of the inhibitors. From a crude extract of chick peas (Cicer arietinum L.) inhibitors of trypsin and chymotrypsin were isolated by affinity chromatography on a column of trypsin-Sepharose 6B. The content of inhibitors was found to be 1.5 g/kg. They were further separated into six isoinhibitors by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25. Two of the isoinhibitors accounted for about 50% of the isolated inhibitors and were further purified to a homogeneous state. The isoinhibitors had a molecular weight of about 10000 as determined by molecular-sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-75. They were stable towards extremes of pH and temperatures up to 75 degrees C or towards digestion by pepsin. They were also stable in 6 M urea but not in 6 M guanidine-HCl. The intact inhibitors were destroyed when the peas were cooked at 100 degrees C or when they were toasted at 130 degrees C. The four major inhibitors had similar amino acid compositions and did not contain detectable amounts of free sulfhydryl groups, tryptophan or carbohydrate. Cysteine is the dominant amino acid residue in all of them and accounted for about 20% of their amino acid content. The isoelectric point of the isoinhibitors lies in the range of pH 4.9-8.6 and two of the major inhibitors had isoelectric points of pH 4.75 and pH 4.96. They inhibited chymotrypsin to the same extent but differed in their inhibitory activities towards trypsin, indicating that they are mixtures of native and trypsinmodified forms and that they probably have separate sites for the two enzymes. They did not inhibit other proteolytic enzymes belonging to two groups (i.e., serine or cysteine enzymes) or originating from different sources (i.e., animals, plants or bacteria).\n",
      "Investigations of the structure of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase from Achromobacter. It was shown by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulphate solution that 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase from Achromobacter IVS is composed of two different subunits with molecular weights of about 78000 and 96000, respectively. The biotin is bound to the heavier subunit. It was previously found that 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase contains four biotin molecules per complex. A complex composed of four of each subunit would thus have a molecular weight of about 700000. This is compatible with the molecular weight of 760000 determined earlier by analytical ultracentrifugation. Both subunits were isolated preparatively. As the subunits, unlike the complex, are very sensitive to oxygen, special precautions had to be taken during isolation. The biotin-containing subunit was isolated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in 5 M urea. It no longer catalyzed the overall reaction, yet could still carboxylate free biotin. The biotin-free subunit was separated after dissociation of the enzyme by three-days' dialysis at pH 9.8 under nitrogen. On chromatography over a Sepharose-bound avidin column, the biotin-subunit was fixed and the biotin-free subunit was eluted unretarded. The latter subunit showed no enzymic activity. After the addition of the biotin-containing subunit, overall activity was regenerated. The speed of reassociation is very much enhanced by 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. It was shown by reassociation experiments under different conditions that probably an initial complex, AxBy is formed, possessing a binding site for 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Upon the binding of this substrate the conformation may be changed to a form favourable for reconstitution. Finally, the structures of biotin enzymes from different sources are compared. In the course of evolution there is a tendency toward integration of the different constituent proteins into only one polypeptide chain.\n",
      "Polyadenylated RNA from Vicia faba meristematic root cells. Localization and size estimation of the poly (A) segment. After incubating root apices from two-day-old bean seedlings with [3H] adenine the RNA was extracted from whole cells or polysomes, and the poly (A) sequences were isolated by nuclease digestion followed by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography. The alterations of the RNA molecules due to the various treatments were monitored by sucrose density gradients. It was found that sequential extraction first at pH 7.6 then at pH 9.0 did not result in a separation between RNA poor in poly(A) sequences and poly(A)-rich RNA. Furthermore chromatography analysis of hydrolysates from nuclease-resistant RNA extracted either at pH 7.6 or pH 9.0 revealed that AMP constituted nearly 95% of the bases and that the poly(A) sequences, about 200 bases, were located at the 3' terminus of the polyadenylated RNA. No size difference was found for the poly(A) segment between the pH-7.6-extracted RNA and that extracted at pH 9.0.\n",
      "Time-dependent inhibition of diamine oxidase by carbonyl-group reagents and urea. 1. The behaviour of several carbonyl group reagents and urea as time-dependent inhibitors of both pig kidney and human placental diamine oxidase is described. 2. Plots of log (vt/vo) against time were not linear with these reagents as the usual theories predict. 3. This was particularly the case with aminoguanidine and phenylhydrazine and a thorough study of the effects of these compounds on the human placental diamine oxidase is described. 4. By applying a new theory for time-dependent inhibition, the inhibition of diamine oxidase by aminoguanidine and phenylhydrazine is adequately accounted for. 5. The time-dependent recovery of activity on addition of sodium pyruvate suggested that the compounds used are acting solely as carbonyl group reagents, inhibiting by Schiff-base formation at the active-site carbonyl group.\n",
      "Acetylglucagon: preparation and characterization. Acetylated derivatives of glucagon have been prepared by reacting this hormone under various conditions with acetic anhydride. They have been chemically characterized by the use of a 14C-labeled reagent, by peptide mapping techniques following hydrolysis by pronase and chymotrypsin, and by spectroscopy. Acetylation in sodium acetate (pH 5.5) results in a full substitution of the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal histidyl residue, but in a partial (about 0.3 acetyl group per residue) substitution of the epsilon-amino group of the lysyl residue 12. The monosubstituted (on the alpha-amino group) and the disubstituted (on both amino groups) acetylated components have been separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose. Acetylation in sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) results in a complete substitution of both amino groups and of the hydroxyl groups of the tyrosyl residues 10 and 13. Complete deacetylation of the O-acetyltyrosyl residues occurs upon treatment with hydroxyl-amine. Mono, di and tetraacetylglucagon are homogeneous when analyzed by disc gel electrophoresis; di and tetrasubstituted derivatives show an increased mobility towards the anode. 125I-labeled derivatives of acetylglucagon show higher distribution coefficients in the aqueous two-phase dextran/poly(ethylene glycol) system than do similar derivatives of glucagon. Acetylation decreases in parallel the ability of glucagon to stimulate the activity of adenylate cyclase and to bind to its receptors in liver cell membranes of the rat. The biological potencies of the mono, di and tetrasubstituted derivates are, respectively, about 10, 1 and 0.1% that of native glucagon. The binding properties of the material dissociated from the acetylglucagon-receptor complex suggest that the reduction in biological activity results from a decrease in the intrinsic affinity of the modified glucagon for the receptors, as well as from the presence of small amounts of residual, unreacted glucagon. Studies with 125I-labeled derivatives of glucagon indicate that acetylation decreases the rate of association and increases the rate of dissociation of the hormone-receptor complex.\n",
      "Purification and properties of a periplasmic aminoendopeptidase from Escherichia coli. A periplasmic aminoendopeptidase from Escherichia coli has been purified to hemogeneity. It is a monomer of molecular weight 45000 and containing one -- SH group that is necessary for catalytic activity. The study of its substrate specificity indicated that the enzyme has both aminopeptidase and endopeptidase activity. The pH optimum for L-alanine p-nitroanilide hydrolysis is between 7 and 7.5 and that for 125I-labeled casein proteolysis between 7.3 and 7.6. The activation energy for the hydrolysis of L-anine p-nitroanilide was calculated to be 5.3 kcal X mol-1 (22.2 kJ X mol-1).\n",
      "The interaction of organic phosphates with human and chicken hemoglobin. In this study of the binding properties of inositol hexaphosphate and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to chicken and human deoxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin were compared. It appeared that in all cases the binding to chicken hemoglobin is much stronger than to human hemoglobin. This is very probably due to the fact that 4 out of the 12 residues, responsible for the binding of phosphates in chicken hemoglobin, are arginines. These are absent in human hemoglobin, where the binding site is made up to only 8 residues. For chicken hemoglobin one strong binding site could be observed in both unliganded and liganded hemoglobin. From these observations we conclude that the same binding site is involved in both the oxy- and deoxy structure showing different affinity to phosphates in the two conformational states. For human hemoglobin we reached the same conclusion.\n",
      "Hepatic nucleases. Extrahepatic origin and association of neutral liver ribonuclease with lysosomes. In the large granule fraction of rat liver, the density distribution of inhibitor-sensitive neutral ribonuclease is similar to that for acid hydrolases and its density distribution is similarly modified by Triton WR-1339 accumulation in lysosomes. Particulate neutral ribonuclease is latent; the enzyme is unmasked by very low digitonin concentrations or hypoosmotic shock. These observations demonstrate that the bulk of liver neutral ribonuclease is associated with the lysosomal system. In view of the neutral pH optimum of the enzyme and of some particularities of its distribution in fractionation experiments, the possiblilty of an extrahepatic origin of neutral ribonuclease has been investigated. After partial pancreatectomy, a significant decrease is observed in both plasma and liver neutral ribonuclease. The effect is specific, for it does not occur for other lysosomal enzymes. Also, labelled bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, when injected intravenously, is taken up by the liver. The sedimentable labelled enzyme has a density distribution similar to the distribution of other foreign proteins, horseradish peroxidase or yeast invertase. These results are explained by the uptake of plasmatic neutral ribonuclease from pancreatic origin by the liver.\n",
      "Glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes. Molecular weight, subunit composition and aggregation properties. Glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes exists predominatly as an entity of 100 000 molecular weight under various conditions of pH and ionic strength. The S20,W of 5.5 S and D20W of 50 mum2/s correlate with the molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium. The homogeneity of this species is primarily dependent on the presence of thiols and secondarily on high concentrations of salt. The amino-acid composition of the enzyme shows similarities both with glutathione reductases from other sources and with lipoamide dehydrogenase. From the flavin content and dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis it is inferred that the native enzyme is a dimer composed of similar subunits of 50 000 molecular weight. In the absence of thiols, glutathione reductase shows a tendency to form tetramers and larger aggregates. Although these larger species are also catalytically active, under cellular conditions the presence of its product, reduced glutathione, should maintain the enzyme as the dimeric entity.\n",
      "GAMMA-Glutamyl transpeptidase of sheep-kidney cortex. Isolation, catalytic properties and dissociation into two polypeptide chains. Gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase was isolated from sheep kidney cortex as an apparently homogeneous, highly active protein. At optimal pH and in the absence of acceptors, the enzyme catalyzes the release of about 510 mumol of p-nitroaniline per mg protein per min from the model substrate L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a sodium dodecylsulfate buffer system showed the presence of a large (Mr approximately 65000) and a small (Mr approximately 27000) polypeptide chain. Dissociation into two polypeptide chains was also achieved in 8 M urea. Amidination with dimethylsuberimidate produced a crosslinked protein of molecular weight approximately 90000. In the course of this work a convenient procedure was developed for the determination of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity using L[glycine-2-3H]glutathione as the substrate. In this procedure the release of cysteinyl-[2-3H]glycine from glutathione is followed, after separation of the radioactive di-peptide from unreacted glutathione on a small Dowex-1 acetate column. The reactions with gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide and glutathione are both strongly activated by several metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) and by a number of amino acids and peptide acceptors. The products of the reaction with glutathione were identified as cysteinylglycine, gamma-glutamylglutathione and glutamate. The formation of these products is consistent with the function of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in both the gamma-glutamyl transfer reaction and in the hydrolysis of the gamma-glutamyl bond. The activating effect of metal ions in the reaction with glutathione was shown to be dependent on the acceleration of the transfer reaction; the rate of hydrolysis of the gamma-glutamyl bond remaining unchanged.\n",
      "Pyrophosphatase and glucuronosyltransferase in microsomal UDPglucuronic-acid metabolism in the rat liver. 1. A radiochemical method for the studies on the microsomal UDPglucuronic acid metabolism has been developed. 2. The rat liver microsomes caused a rapid hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid to D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and further although much slower to free D-glucuronic acid. In Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) they were produced in ratio 72 : 1. No other metabolites were found in measurable amounts. The pyrophosphatase splitting UDPglucuronic acid showed a pH optimum at 8.9, but the liberation of D-glucuronic acid from UDPglucuronic acid had two pH maxima (pH 3.5 and 8.5). EDTA appeared to be less powerful inhibitor of pyrophosphatase than previously suggested. About 25 per cent of the UDPglucuronic acid hydrolyzing activity was still remaining in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone was found to have a slight inhibitory action on the pyrophosphatase activity. Citrate inhibited powerfully the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid and the liberation of free D-glucuronic acid. Phosphate was also inhibitory. 3. In the presence of an exogenous UDPglucuronosyltransferase substrate, 4-nitrophenol, the formation of D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and free D-glucuronic acid were slightly reduced, and D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate, 4-nitrophenylglucuronide and free D-glucuronic acid were produced in ratio 78 : 23 : 1. When 10 mM EDTA was added to diminish the hydrolytic consumption of the glucuronyl donor substrate, the corresponding ratio was still as unfavorable as 19 : 2.6 : 1. The measurable activity of UDPglucuronosyltransferase was lower in the presence of phosphate or citrate than in Tris-HCl buffer, although they protected the glucuronyl donor substrate against hydrolysis. 4. The results indicate that even in the presence of added glucuronyl acceptor substrate the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid predominates the conjugation in rat liver microsomes. The rate of the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid is quite considerable even in the presence of EDTA, and it is recommended to control the UDPglucuronic acid pyrophosphatase activity when UDPglucuronosyltransferase and glucuronidation reactions are studied. Free D-glucuronic acid appears to be produced from UDPglucuronic acid for further use via D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate, the rate-limiting step being the hydrolysis of this intermediate. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, glucuronides of either endogenous or exogenous aglycones and beta-glucuronidase have only a minor role in this respect in rat liver microsomes.\n",
      "Incorporation of (1-14C)palmitoyl-CoA into phosphatidylcholine by plasma membranes of rat submaxillary glands in vitro. 1. On incubation with the isolated rat submaxillary gland plasma membranes, [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA was incorporated mainly into phosphatidylcholine and hydrolysed to [1-14C]palmitic acid and CoASH. 2. The addition of lysophosphatidylcholine enhanced the incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and lowered the hydrolysis of palmitoyl-CoA markedly. 3. In the presence of lysophosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl-CoA incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was maximum at 0.1 mM palmitoyl-CoA, 0.5 mM lysophosphatidylcholine and between pH 7.0 and 9.0. 4. The incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was stimulated by Na+, K+ and K-, inhibited by Ca2+ and Mg2+ and unaffected by sodium deoxycholate and ATP. 5. Epinephrine inhibited the incorporation of palmitoyl-CoA into phosphatidylcholine in the presence or absence of ATP, the inhibition being more in the presence of ATP than in its absence. Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate mimicked the inhibitory effect of epinephrine.\n",
      "Hydrogen-isotope exchange of oxidized and reduced cytochrome c. A comparison of mass spectrometry and infrared methods. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange in 2H20 solutions of the two redox states of horse heart cytochrome c was investigated at 20 degrees C, pH 7, by mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry indicates that ferricytochrome has 20 hydrogens unexchanged after 24 h, 28 hydrogens exchanging between 10 min and 24 h, and 156 hydrogens exchanging within 10 min; comparative values for ferrocytochrome are 45, 19 and 140. The displacement of the exchange curves obtained by infrared corresponds to 8 to 9 peptide hydrogens. These combined methods show many non-peptide hydrogens exchanging rapidly (87 and 79 for ferricytochrome c and ferrocytochrome c respectively), whereas others, probably buried inside the molecule and involved in hydrogen bonds, are not exchanged, even after 24 h (14 and 30 hydrogens respectively, which is relatively large for a small protein). Infrared results are given in terms of changes of standard free energy for the transconformational reaction which exposes the peptide hydrogens to solvent: in ferricytochrome c and ferrycoytochrome c, 30% and 40% respectively of the peptide hydrogens are protected by conformational transitions stabilized by more than 5 kcal/mol (21 kJ/mol), which implies a large increase in rigidity for the reduced form.\n",
      "Bacterial metabolism of resorcinylic compounds: purification and properties of orcinol hydroxylase and resorcinol hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida ORC. The hydroxylase activities observed in extracts of Pseudomonas putida ORC after growth on orcinol and resorcinol as sole source of carbon have been purified to homogeneity. Both enzymes were shown to be flavoproteins and to contain approximately 1 mol of FAD for each polypeptide chain, S20,W values for each enzyme are 4.1 +/- 0.1 and are independent of the presence of their aromatic substrates. Molecular weight determinations under native (approximately 68000) and denaturing (approximately 70000) conditions indicated that they are monomeric. The visible absorption spectra identical but the circular dichroic spectra of the two proteins can be distinguished. Although each protein catalyzes the NAD(P)H and O2-dependent hydroxylation of both orcinol and resorcinol, the efficiency of the transformations of the substrates by the two enzymes is radically different; furthermore resorcinol hydroxylase is much more versatile in the aromatic compounds it can utilize as substrates and effectors. Other properties of the enzymes which clearly establish their own identity include their serological characteristics and amino acid composition; the latter property is particularly evident when the quantities of valine and alanine residues are compared. The synthesis of each enzyme is also under different regulatory constraints, being controlled by the substrate used for growth.\n",
      "[Possible structural-functional organization of the system of local cerebral blood flow regulation]. rCBF under normal conditions in the rabbit, cat, and monkey brain was found to have a spontaneous periodicity while rCBF responses to afferent flicker stimulation usually revealed a double-phasic fluctuative pattern. This suggests that the rCBF regulatory system consists of not less than two regulatory chains with different time constants, and a feedback. The data on cerebral vascular responses to microapplication of mCSF solutions with various pH, potassium and catecholamines concentrations, suggest that rapid regulatory chains may be conditioned by potassium and neurogenic vascular effects, while slow ones could be mediated by CO2 and related pH changes.\n",
      "[Regulation of local tissue PO2 in the cerebral cortex of the cat]. Local PO2 was measured in the cat cortex on adjacent sites with a platinum multiwire surface electrode both during steady state conditions and with varying arterial oxygen supply. Concomitantly, PO2 in the sinus sagittalis was recorded continuously through the vascular wall. Under normoxia and steady state conditions local tissue PO2 values varied between O Torr and almost arterial levels of 85 Torr in accordance with theoretical calculations. With increased arterial oxygen supply local tissue PO2 as measured on agjacent sites was found to react fairly differently. Linear increases in local tissue PO2 as compared with arterial PO2, as well as constant levels, or only very small increases, were recorded. The constancy of local PO2 (=\"local PO2 autoregulation\") was caused by local vasoconstriction. With reduced supply of arterial oxygen, however, tissue PO2 dropped in all studied sites down to hypoxia and anoxia. PO2 autoregulation during a decrease in arterial PO2, as described by Bicher (1973) could not be found.\n",
      "[Differences in the responses of taste receptors to organic and inorganic acids with changes in the concentration of bicarbonate in the solution]. The thresholds of the pH for citric acid (pH=4.9) were found to exceed by 1.4 pH the thresholds for HC1 (3.5) at 1.2 mmol/1 bicarbonate in the solution. The reaction to citric acid was higher than to HC1 at equal pH. Decreasing of bicarbonate from 1.2 mmol/1 to 0 reduced pH threshold only for sitric acid from 4.90 to 3.15. pH threshold for HC1 remained 3.5 The chorda tympani response to stimulation with solutions containing bicarbonate (1.2 mmol/1) was higher than in absence of bicarbonate. The data obtained suggest two ranges of the acids in action.\n",
      "Analysis of skin grafts across the MSA-barrier in mice pretreated with sera from specifically or syngeeically grafted donors. Prolonged survival of weakly incompatible skin allografts in mice (across the barrier presented by the MSA) can be induced by pretreating the recipients not only with a specific anti-MSA serum (obtained on day 5 after a single MSA-incompatible skin graft) but also be means of control serum obtained in a similar way from the recipients of fully compatible (syngeneic) skin grafts. Administration of serum from non-grafted mice had no effect on graft survival. The similar biological effect of both sera had a counterpart in their similar content and spectrum of glycosaminoglycans. Also in the skin grafts themselves, the course of both qualitative and quantitative changes of GAG in the early postgrafting period was in the allogeneic and syngeneic situation similar. The possible role of these substances in the serum and at the site of grafting and their effect on the outcome of the allograft response are discussed.\n",

Patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer were given two types of diet -a normal and a ulcer-type diet.

No evidence was then found to be in support of the still widely used restricted diet in the treatment of peptic ulcer.\n",
      "Impaired Sertoli cell function in experimental cryptorchidism in the rat. The production of testicular androgen-binding protein (ABP), as a measure of Sertoli cell function, was studied after unilateral or bilateral experimental cryptorchidism in adult rats. Two or 4 weeks after the testis had been translocated to the abdomen, no major changes were found in the concentration of ABP per mg protein, although there was a marked and progressive decrease in ABP content per testis. However, the rate of ABP production was greatly decreased, as measured by the accumulation of ABP during 16-h ligation of the efferent ducts or by the production of ABP by testis mince in an in vitro system. This indicates that the Sertoli cell function is severly impaired by the intra-abdominal position.\n",
      "The oxygen transport system of red blood cells during diabetic ketoacidosis and recovery. Daily evaluations of 8 newly detected ketoacidotic diabetics showed the Bohr-effect of haemoglobin to be decreased by 50% while erythrocyte 2,3-DPG was decreased below 10 mumoles/g Hb. 2,3-DPG correlated strongly with pH during acidosis and with plasma inorganic phosphate (Pi) subsequently to the first insulin administration. Oxygen affinity of haemoglobin, measured as P50 act pH, was unchanged in ketoacidosis compared to the time, however, P50 act pH fell striking (p less than 0.001) and remained decreased up to 7 days depending upon the resynthesis of 2,3-DPG in relation to Pi. The Hill-coefeficient in reflecting the slope of the oxygen dissociation curve was diminished in ketoacidosis (p less than 0.005), and decreased further after pH-normalization (p less than 0.005). There was a close association of n with 2,3-DPG (p less than 0.001) and additionally with Pi at 2,3-DPG-levels below 10 mumoles/g Hb. Based on these findings a decreased erythrocyte oxygen release of one fifth during acidosis and more than one third after pH-correction can be hypothesised. In view of the intimate relation of Pi to the oxygen transport system it is suggesed that treatment of ketoacidosis should include Pi-sugstitution.\n",
      "Fluorescence of oxidized flavoproteins from perifused isolated pancreatic islets. In perifused pancreatic islets, the fluorescence of oxidized flavoproteins (FAD) was recorded continuously. Elevation of glucose concentration in the medium form 0 or 5 mM to 20 mM led to decrease in FAD-fluorescence beginning 10 sec after change of medium. L-leucine (10 mM), (+/-)-B-BCH (20 mM) and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (10 mM) caused typical kinetics of FAD-fluorescence decrease. The results are interpreted to indicate rapid changes of the functional state of B-cell mitochondria induced by the above-mentioned stimulators of insulin release.\n",
      "Comparison of amino acids bathing the oxyntic gland area in the stimulation of gastric secretion. This study was undertaken to compare the ability of L- and D-isomers of amino acids bathing the oxyntic gland area to stimulate acid secretion in conscious dogs with Heidenhain pouch (HP), gastric fistula (GF) and pancreatic fistula (PF). Acid outputs from HP were determined by an intragastric titration method when amino acid solutions were perfused into HP at various concentrations, pH values, and distention pressures. Only L-isomers of all natural amino acids were found to stimulate acid secretion, whereas D-isomers of amino acids tested were completely inert in this respect. The comparison of the secretagogue activity of amino acids shows that L-histidine among essential amino acids and glycine among nonessential amino acids exhibited the strongest stimulation of acid outputs, reaching, respectively, 52 and 40% of the maximal response to histamine. Decreasing the pH of L-histidine solution perfused into HP in sequential order from 5.0 to 1.0 resulted in a stepwise reduction of acid output, falling at pH 1.0 to about 40% of the peak response achieved at pH 5.0. Local irrigation of HP by 2% xylocaine and intravenous infusion of atropine (100 mug per kg per hr) or metiamide (2.9 mg per kg per hr) reduced but did not abolish HP response to chemical stimulation and the pH dependency of this response. We conclude that only L- and not D-isomers of amino acids bathing the oxyntic gland area stimulate acid secretion by a local, gastrin-independent mechanism sensitive to distention pressure and pH.\n",
      "Evidence of tandem duplication of genes in a merodiploid region of Pneumococcal mutants resistant to sulfonamide. A Pneumococcal mutant, sulr-c, resistant to sulfonamides, and three transformants bearing associated d or d+ resistance markers have earlier been reported to be unstable and show distinct patterns and frequencies of segregating stable progeny lacking the c marker. Each of the four strains showed a characteristic dosage of the genes involved in the merodiploidy. Complementary strands of DNA's from these stable and unstable strains were resolved and homoduplex and heteroduplex hybrids made from the separated DNA strands were used as donors in genetic transformations. Activities of a normal marker (streptomycin resistance) and those involved in the heterozygosity (c, d and d+) were quantitatively measured. From those heteroduplexes made up of opposite strands derived from a heterozygote and a stable strain, the normal marker is transferred efficiently, but the heterozygous markers are not. On the other hand, if both strands of a heteroduplex are derived from different heterozygotic strains, all markers can be transferred with usual efficiency to a stable recipient strain. The lowered efficiency in the former type of heteroduplex is attributed to an inhomology resulting from a tandem duplication in the merodiploid strains, and a postulated DNA repair process stimulated by it while in the form of the donor duplex. The inhomology probably includes (a) a microheterogeneity between the c site and the wild type locus, and (b) a more extensive incompatibility attributable to an extra segment of genome in a tandem duplication covering the c and d sites. The first of these inhomologies produces a lowered efficiency of transfer from all configurations of the particular d allele associated with the mutant c marker, and therefore accounts for the characteristic transfer patterns even from the native merodiploid DNA's.\n",
      "A study of Pneumococcal merodiploids at the molecular level. The DNA of a sulfonamide-resistant Pneumococcal strain (heterozygous for sulr-c) and that of three highly resistant and persistently heterozygous cd transformants, derived by introducing sulr-c marker into a stable sulfonamide resistant strain (sulr-d), were studied to analyze the genetic basis of their merodiploidy. The physical properties of the native and denatured DNA from the heterozygotes and the nonheterozygous strains were not distinguishable. The denaturability and the renaturability of biological activity for the heterozygous markers were essentially identical to those of the normal markers. The heterozygosity extends to the closely linked locus giving rise to four different configurations of cd and cd+ transformants, characterized by their frequencies of segregation and donor-marker activities. The marker-activity ratios and the frequency of co-transfer of heterozygous markers were found to remain the same in each when the donor DNA was native, denatured or reannealed without fractionation or reannealed after remixing of resolved strands. Possible models were weighed against these observations and these considerations led to the suggestion that tandem duplication of a gene region may be responsible for the heterozygosity and instability of this region. A more detailed examination of this model will be presented in an accompanying paper.\n",
      "Genetic hybridization at the unlinked thy and str loci of Streptococcus. The sanguis and pneumoniae species of Streptococcus were used as recipients in transformations from str+ to str-r and from thy- to thy+. The str-r mutations in the two species had been previously shown to be allelic. Homology of the thy- mutations in the two species was demonstrated in the similar phenotypic properties they conferred (death in the absence of thymidine, lack of thymidylate synthetase). The str and thy loci are unlinked in each species.--- When the two species are transformed by both homospecific and heterospecific DNA, the efficiency is always lower in the heterospecific cross. The efficiency of heterospecific transformation is considerably lower at the thy than at the str locus. DNA was extracted from recipients that had integrated markers of heterospecific origin. When such hybrid DNA is tested on the original recipient species, the heterospecific markers are usually as efficient as homospecific markers. When tested on the original donor species, however, the hybrid DNA is usually more efficient than heterospecific DNA. This is true for both thy and str transformation. -- -- Forty independent thy+ hybrids were obtained in the cross of sanguis thy- recipients with pneumoniae thy+ DNA. These hybrids fall into a number of classes based upon the relative efficiency with which their extracted DNA's are able to transfer the thy+ marker into pneumoniae thy- cells. The most efficient of these DNA's exhibits about 20% of the efficiency of homospecific pneumoniae thy+ DNA and three orders of magnitude greater efficiency than heterospecific sanguis thy+ DNA. Thus, very little of the inefficiency of heterospecific transformation of the thy locus is ascribable to a classic restriction mechanism. Rather, the wild-type thy+ loci in the two species appear to differ at multiple sites, and independent heterospecific transfers result in differential extents of integration of these sites. On this basis, the thy+ loci of the two species differ at a greater number of sites than do the respective str+ loci.\n",

A modification of the fibrin plate method is presented. Plasminogen-free human fibrinogen and plasminogen purified by affinity chromatography have been used. Fibrin plates without and with a constant amount of plasminogen and with agarose as stabilizing medium were used for the estimation of plasmin and plasminogen activator activity. Activator activity could be demonstrated in sterile bile and saliva. When plasmin activity was present, estimations of plasminogen activator were approximate. The method is sensitive, small volumes of reagents and samples are needed. The error of the method is comparatively low and the reproducibility is good.\n",
      "[Thefts without motive of gain as a psychopathologic syndrome (author's transl)]. Thefts without motive of pain have been known since the early 19th century. But the problem has not been solved. While they were formerly considered a mental disease, today they are not seen as something special. But they still happen. Only a small percentage of common shop-lifting can be called a psycholopathologic syndrome. Many explanations and analyses have been published which are discussed in detail. In a group described here comprehensively difficult marital situations full of conflict, marital sexual frustration, depression, physical and mental exhaustion and aggressive and suicidal tendencies are found. Theft appears to be closely connected with these. But the pattern of motivation and causation is by no means stereo-typed. In order to clear up such actions one will have to consider as exactly as possible the biographic connection and what happens during the act - quite apart from somatic conditions. Present assessment in reports is totally unsatisfactory. To clear up the controversial questions is urgently necessary.\n",

      "A micro-method for quantitative determination of acylneuraminic acids from erythrocyte membranes. A micro-method is presented which enables the fast and exact determination of acid-hydrolyzed acylneuraminic acids in erythrocyte membranes. Erythrocytes from 1 ml of human and rabbit blood containing ACD buffer are, washed and hemolyzed on Millipore filters of pore size 1.2 mu. Acylneuraminic acids are released from the erythrocyte membranes still on the filters under the optimal conditions of 0.1 N HCl at 80 degrees C for 50 min. A prerequisite for the determination of the true amount of acylneuraminic acids using the periodic acid/thiobarbituric acid assay is the small-scale extraction of lipids from the hydrolysate and anion-exchange chromatography of acylneuraminic acids. The values thus obtained must be corrected, as 20% of acylneuraminic acids are destroyed during acid hydrolysis. In samples of human blood from 10 healthy individuals, on an average 223 nmol acylneuraminic acids per ml of packed erythrocytes were found, and in the same amount of rabbit erythrocytes, 1e method for a screening of the acylneuraminic acid content of erythrocyte membranes in hemolytic diseases or of other cell membranes is discussed.\n",

Acid phosphatases I, II and III have molecular weights of greater than 200 000, of 107 000, and of 13 400, respectively. Following partial purification, isoenzyme II was obtained as a single activity band, as assessed by activity staining with p-nitrophenyl phosphate and alpha-naphthyl phosphate on polyacrylamide gels run at several pH values. With 50mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, enzymes II and III exhibit plateaus of activity over the pH range 3 - 5 and 3.5 - 6, respectively. Acid phosphatase II is not significantly inhibited by 0.5% formaldehyde. The activity of human liver acid phosphatase II and of human prostatic acid phosphatase towards several substrates is compared. The liver enzyme, is marked contrast to the prostatic enzyme, does not hydrolyze O-phosphoryl choline.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of pepsin-treated type III collagen from calf skin. Calf skin collagen was solubilized by incubating acid-extracted calf skin with pepsin at pH 2.0 and 25 degrees C, conditions that did not cause degradation of the triple helical region of collagen. Type III collagen was separated from type I collagen by differential salt precipitation at pH 7.5. The isolated type III collagen contained mainly gamma and higher molecular weight components cross-linked by reducible and/or non-reducible bonds. The isolated alpha1 (III) chains had an amino acid composition characteristic of type III collagen. Denatured but unreduced type III collagen, chromatographed on carboxymethyl-cellulose, eluted in the alpha 2 region, while after reduction and alkylation the alpha1 (III) chains eluted between the positions of alpha1 (I) and alpha2. The mid-point melting temperature temperature (tm) of type III collagen (35.1 degrees C) in a citrate buffer at pH 3.7 was somewhat lower than that of type I collagen (35.9 degrees C). Renaturation experiments at 25 degrees C showed that denatured type III collagen molecules with intact intramolecular disulfide bridges (gamma components) reform the triple helical structure of collagen much faster than reduced and carboxymethylated alpha1 (III) chains.\n",

      "Suppressor T cells and host resistance to tye 111 pneumococcus after treatment with antilymphocyte serum. The antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SS-II) was significantly increased in mice treated with antilymphocyte serum (ALS). BALG/c mice given 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1 relative to the days of immunization with 0.5 mug of SSS-II had a 20-fold increment (11,383 increased to 199,917) in the number of splenic plaque-forming cells enumerated on day 5 compared with untreated, immunized controls. This effect has been attributed to the elimination of subpopulation of thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) that has suppressor function. The present series of experiments relate the augmented antibody response to SSS-II in mice treated with ALS to increased host resistance after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, type III (Pn-II). The 50%  lethal dose of Pn-III in niminnunized mice was 102 and the 100% lethal dose was 103 organisms. Mice immunized with 0.5 mug of SSS-III and challenged 5 days later with Pn-III were completely protected against a dose of up to 108 organisms. Mice treated with 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1, immunized with SSS-III on day 0, and challenged with 2.5 X 10(9) Pn-III on day 5 had a mean survival time of greater than 100 h compared with 16 h for immunized non-serum-treated controls. Animals given a single injection of ALS before immunization showed no increase in resistance, whereas mice treated after immunization had significant prolongation of survival times. Untreated, immunized mice challenged with 5 X 10(9), 1 X 5 X 10(8) Pn-II survived 14 to 19 h, whereas ALS-treated animals had mean survival times of 48, 174, and 222 h, respectively. These findings suggest that immunoregulatory T cells may have a biologically significant effect in a narrow zone in which the normal host immune response is insufficient but still potentially capable of providing some additional degree of protection if suppressor cells are elimated.\n",
      "[Past and present aspects of diarrheal disease in childhood. Clinical study and treatment (author's transl)]. The etiologic and pathophysiologic findings described in the first part of this paper have important consequences: The recognition of the specific etiology of diarrhea requires new laboratory methods: most of these, however, are technically easy to perform and do not require a large laboratory. A long-ranging consequence of this changed concept is a well-founded modification of therapy. The most important discovery was, that in a well balanced glucose electrolyte solution sodium and glucose enhance their absorption mutually and increase the absorption of water by solvent drag. Since in most acute diarrheas the mechanisms of absorption of glucose and electrolytes are retained this mechanism can be utilized for fast oral rehydration and reinstitution of normal intestinal homeostasis. Prompt institution of a diet consisting of the previously mentioned glucose-electrolyte solution usually prevents severe dehydration and the need for stationary treatment. The elimination of lactose and long chain fatty acids from the diet prevents continuation of the pathologic osmotic and chemical conditions in the intestine. Antibiotics are not indicated in acute diarrhea with the exception of diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive E. Coli or Shigella, in the case of Salmonella-gastroenteritis even contraindicated. Further research concentrates on the development of drugs for neutralisation of E. Coli enterotoxin and the prevention of diarrheas by development of effective vaccines.\n",
      "Population growth-a menace to what? Originally, many of the initiators of the World Population Conference, which took place in Bucharest in 1974, had hoped that the Conference would imply a final breakthrough for the view that family planning measures should be given top priority in all less-developed countries. In fact, however, the Plan of Action passed by the Conference contains very little relating to population and family planning. Instead, the document is dominated by wordy phrases about the necessity of attaining social and economic development in those countries. Will the insight that family planning programs work efficiently only if they are an integral part of programs for the social and economic development of a country lead to such programs being realized? There is every reason to doubt that the plan of Action will have any such effect. The reasons for the underdevelopment of Third World countries cannot be removed through such United Nations resolutions. In the People's Republic of China, family planning is widely accepted, especially in the towns, and now also among the rural population. Limiting the number of children is considered part of China's development effort. China is a less-developed country that is in the process of rapid social and economic development. The issue at stake in other Third World countries is how to achieve a similar development. As soon as this goal is achieved, family planning efforts are meaningful and have a chance of success. The experience of China demonstrates that even there it took time before the efforts succeeded. There are many Third World countries that could, without much difficulty, support a population considerably larger than the present one. But there are no doubt also a number of countries where the population is already so large that a continued population increase would be harmful. The need to achieve rapid development becomes increasingly urgent, not in the least to make it possible to attain a reduced population growth. The sad truth is that so little development takes place in those countries. Without social and economic development, the present rapid population increase will continue in those countries where there is already an overly dense population.\n",

Among the changes that have been brought about in health delivery in the People's Republic of China, the introduction of the barefoot doctor has been one of the most important and effective ways that the government has devised to radically alter the concept of health care. Through close identification with the community in terms of recruitment, training, and practice, the barefoot doctor is a concrete manifestation of the ideological principles of following the mass line and being self-reliant. The paper focuses on the building of rural health services, with special reference to the training of the barefoot doctor as the first-level contact person in primary care in the communes.

      "Investigations of the excretion of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase into the urine. The excretion of the enzyme gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase and its isoenzymes into the urine was investigated in patients with renal diseases and compared with the excretion of the enzymes leucine-aminopeptidase and lactate-dehydrogenase. In animal experiments an increased excretion of these enzymes was found after autotransplantation. Increased excretion of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase was also found in patients with glomerulonephritis and in the polyuric phase of acute tubular necrosis, but not in cases of pyelonephritis and in the oliguric phase of acute tubular necrosis. The alterations of the isoenzyme pattern during diseases with increased enzyme excretion are in accordance with the hypothesis that the enzymes are liberated from the kidney tissue into the urine, and only a minority stems from the blood. Investigation of the excretion of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase and its isoenzymes into the urine seems to be of both scientific and clinical interest.\n",
      "Interaction of adrenergic antagonists with prostaglandin E2 and tetrahydrocannabinol in the eye. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists have been utilized in an atempt to discern the site of action of prostaglandin (PG) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the eye. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists (alpha-antagonists, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine; beta-antagonists, propranolol and sotalol) cuased a dose-dependent reduction in intraocular pressure and blood pressure and increased total outflow facility. The results are consistent with the concept that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are present in the anterior uvea and that vasomotor tone is essential to the maintenance of normal intraocular pressure. No antagonist reduced the PG-induced elevation of intraocular pressure unless the blood pressure was severely lowered. All antagonists inhibit the normal PG-induced increase in total outflow facility, indicating that these agents protect the blood-aqueous barrier from breakdown without altering the vasodilatory response to PG. All antagonists reduced the fall in intraocular pressure produced by THC by approximately 50 per cent, except for sotalol which completely abolished the intraocular pressure fall. Only the alpha-adrenergic antagonists prevented the THC-induced increase in total outflow facility. The results indicate that true outflow facility may well be regulated exclusively by alpha-receptors. The data are consistent with the effect of THC being primarily a vasodilation of the efferent blood vessels of the anterior uvea. The partial inhibition by alpha-adrenergic antagonists may also suggest a lesser role of THC on the afferent vessels.\n",
      "Induction of corneal graft rejection by passive cell transfer. An experimental model is presented demonstrating that penetrating corneal grafts in the rabbit may be rejected by passive transfer into the anterior chamber of specifically sensitized lymphoid cells. Destruction of histo-incompatible corneal endothelium is always marked by the formation of focal pock-like areas of damage in this system, rather than by the typical moving line of rejecting endothelium usually seen in spontaneous graft rejection. Where the transferred lymphoid cells are compatible with the tissues of the graft recipient, the picture is one of a severely affected graft on a field of uninvolved recipient corneal endothelium. Where the lymphoid cells are compatible with the graft and not with the tissues of the recipient, one sees a clear corneal graft surviving on a field of endothelial destruction on the recipient bed. The specificity of these reactions is illustrated in terms of the histocompatibility relationships between corneal donor, graft recipient, and the donor of the sensitized lymphoid cells.\n",
      "Acute tubular necrosis.  An experimental model detailing the biochemical events accompanying renal injury and recovery. Male Charles River mice, divided into control or experimental groups, received on Day 0 either sterile 0.3 MNaHCO3 in 0.9 per cent saline (pH7.4) intraperitoneal injection or pteroylglutamic acid (200 mug per body weight), similarly buffered to pH7.6, and were sacrificed on Days 0, 1/4, 1/2, 1,2,3,4,7, and 14. The experimental kidneys demonstrated intratubular deposits of pteroylglutamic acid with edema between  Days 1 and 4 with cortical scarring by Day 14. The experimental kidneys reached maximal increases in weight (+90 per cent) on Day 2, RNA (+61 per cent, protein (+67 per cent) on Day 3, and DNA (+25 per cent) on Day 4 before falling to below control levels on Day 14. The control kidneys demonstrated the gradual incremental increases of normal renal growth throughout this period. No change in renal size, protein, RNA, or DNA could be detected in those animals who failed to demonstrate renal tubular damage. It is postulated that the response of the kidney to folic acid administration is a reparative response and not a response directed toward accelerated renal growth.\n",
      "Properties of the 3-o-methyl-D-glucose transport system in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Transport of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3-O-MG) by Acholeplasma laidlawii cells was studied. The 3-O-MG transport system appeared to be constitutive in cells grown on 3-O-MG and glucose; the transport process depended on the concentration of substrate used and exhibited typical saturation kinetics, with an apparent Km of 4.6 muM. 3-O-MG was transported as a free carbohydrate and was not metabolized further in the cell. Dependence on pH and temperature and the results of efflux and \"counterflow\" experiments demonstrated the carrier nature of the transport system. 6-Deoxyglucose and glucose competitively inhibited 3-O-MG transport, whereas maltose inhibited in non-competitively. p-Chloromercuribenzoate, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, N-ethylmaleimide, and iodoacetate inhibited transport of 3-O-MG. Cells were able to accumulate 3-O-MG against a concentration gradient. Some electron transfer inhibitors (rotenone and amytal), arsenate, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and proton conductors such as 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonylcyanide, m-chlorophenylhydrazone, pentachlorophenol, and tetrachlorotrifluoromethylbenzimidazole inhibited this process.\n",
      "Starvation survival of Salmonella enteritidis. Washed cells of Salmonella enteritidis harvested from a defined medium during logarithmic growth were subjected to starvation in pH 7 phosphate buffer at 37 C. Viability was measured by slide cultures and plate counts. The survival of cell suspensions equivalent to 1 to 10 mg (dry wt)/ml was influenced by cryptic growth. The rate of cryptic growth, assessed by plate counts, increased with cell density and could not be alleviated by starvation with dialysis. Dialysis of the starving culture did retard the onset of cryptic growth but did not eliminate it, indicating that the major substrates for regrowth were relatively large cellular components. In phosphate buffer, 6.7 homologous heat-killed cells allowed for the doubling of one S. enteritidis cell. Cryptic growth was not observed when cells were starved on the surface of membrane filters or in suspensions equivalent to 20 mug (dry wt)/ml (105 cells/ml). Similar half-life survival times were calculated for both these populations, but the shape of their survival curves differed significantly. These differences were attributed to stress factors encountered during cell preparation and during starvation. The half-life survival time of S. enteritidis starved at 20 mug (dry wt)/ml was 140 h in phosphate buffer, 82 h in 3,6-endomethylene-1,2,3,-6-tetrahydrophthalic acid buffer, and 77 h in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer.\n",
      "Mismatch correction in pneumococcal transformation: donor length and hex-dependent marker efficiency. A hypothesis that preferential rejection of donor markers by the hex system of pneumococcus is due to lethal double-strand breaks has been examined in terms of its implications for the extent of the excision required. Experiments reported here were directed at asking whether hex-dependent marker efficiency depends on the length of the donor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In the absence of intracellular competition for hex function, there was no detectable effect of DNA size on hex-dependent marker efficiency as donor DNA was sheared from greater than 1 x 107 daltons to 3.6 x 105 daltons. The latter DNA was purified by two successive velocity fractionations to ensure that the activity seen was representative of DNA of that size. Quantitative examination of the system shows that, for the lethal event hypothesis to be true, the excision step has to remove an average of 7,000 to 10,000 nucleotides. This figure is so much greater than that seen in other excision processes that alternate hypotheses should be considered. The presently known properties of the hex system can be accounted for by a model invoking the migratory features of type I restriction enzymes.\n",
      "Microcalorimetric study of the anaerobic growth of Escherichia coli: growth thermograms in a synthetic medium. A microcalorimetric technique was used for studying the growth of Escherichia coli during anaerobiosis. The growth thermograms obtained are complex and the shape of curves is dependent on the hydrogen lyase activity of the cells. Fermentation balances are given for different culture conditions, and simple growth thermograms are obtained when the hydrogen lyase activity is inhibitied.\n",
      "Physiological study of ergot: induction of alkaloid synthesis by tryptophan at the enzymatic level. The enhancement of ergot alkaloid production by tryptophan and its analogues in both normal and high-phosphate cultures is more directly related to increased dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT) synthetase activity rather than to a lack of regulation of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes. Thiotryptophan [beta-(1-benzo-thien-3-yl)-alanine] is rather ineffective in the end product regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis, whereas tryptophan and 5-methyltryptophan are potent effectors. The presence of increased levels of DMAT synthetase in ergot cultures supplemented with tryptophan or thiotryptophan, and to a lesser extent with 5-methyltryptophan, suggests that the induction effect involves de novo synthesis of the enzyme. Thiotryptophan and tryptophan but not 5-methyltryptophan can overcome the block of alkaloid synthesis by inorganic phosphate. The results with thiotryptophan indicate that the phosphate effect cannot be explained merely on the basis of a block of tryptophan synthesis.\n",
      "Microcalorimetric study of the anaerobic growth of Escherichia coli: measurements of the affinity of whole cells for various energy substrates. Microcalorimetry has been used to determine the affinity of whole cells of Escherichia coli for glucose, galactose, fructose, and lactose. Anaerobic growth thermograms were analyzed, and the Km and Vmax values for these energy substrates were measured at pH 7.8. Results obtained with this technique using various organisms growing anaerobically on different sugars are compared. This comparison shows that in practically all cases the cellular rate of catabolic activity is a hyperbolic function of the energy substrate concentrations at low sugar concentrations. In some cases this technique also allows determination of kinetics at high sugar concentrations.\n",
      "Purification and properties of polyol dehydrogenase from Cephalosporium chrysogenus. A polyol dehydrogenase of broad specificity was purified 178-fold from extracts of the filamentous fungus Cephalosporium chrysogenum. The enzyme was found to act as an oxido-reductase in two substrate-coenzyme systems: D-sorbitol (or xylitol)-nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and D-mannitol-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The dehydrogenase was composed of five isozymes, which, as a mixture, exhibited these properties: Km to D-sorbitol and D-mannitol, 7.15 to 10(-2) M; PH optimum, 9 to 10; molecular weight, 300,000 subunit weight, 29,000; PI, 5.8 to 7.5. The NADP-linked activity was labile to treatment with heat or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Mixed substrate assays support the hypothesis that both NAD-, and NADP-linked activities are associated with isozymes of a single dehydrogenase.\n",
      "Effect of alkali on the structure of cell envelopes of Chlamydia psittaci elementary bodies. Suspensions of isolated cell envelopes of infectious elementary bodies (EB) of Chlamydia psittaci at alkaline pH showed a rapid, extensive decrease in absorbance, accompanied by the release of a cell envelope component in a sedimentable form. This phenomenon was observed both at 0 C and with envelopes which had been previously heated to 100 C. Monovalent and divalent cations effectively inhibited the turbidity loss, whereas ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) caused an accelerated decrease in turbidity. The turbidity loss observed after incubation of the envelopes at alkaline pH could be reversed to the level of the initial value by dialysis against distilled water containing Mg2+. Thin-section electron photomicrographs of purified EB exposed to alkaline buffer with EDTA revealed the loss of the internal contents of cells, but these cells still maintained their round shapes. The cell surface of treated EB appeared pitted in negatively stained preparations, whereas intact EB had a smooth surface. Electron microscopic studies on negatively stained preparations of the clear supernatant obtained after the treatment of the envelope with alkaline buffer containing EDTA demonstrated the presence of spherical particles, approximately 6 to 7 nm in diameter, and rodlike particles, which appeared to be made up of two or more spherical particles.\n",
      "Protein-carbohydrate-lipid complex isolated from the cell envelopes of Chlamydia psittaci in alkaline buffer and ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Exposure of isolated cell envelopes from purified infectious elementary (EB) of Chlamydia psittaci to sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer at pH 10 plus ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) results in partial solubilization of the total protein. The released materials represent 20% of the dry weight, 16% of the total protein, 40% of the total carbohydrate, and 9% of the total lipid of the cell envelopes. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and Sephadex G-200, Sepharose 4B, or diethylaminoethyl-cellulose column chromatography, reveal a protein-carbohydrate-lipid complex of several hundred thousand molecular weight that contains 50% protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the isolated EB cell envelopes reveals two major protein bands, A and B, with estimated molecular masses of approximately 85,000 and 53,000, respectively, both of which also stain for the presence of carbohydrate and lipid. Gel electrophoresis of the protein-carbohydrate-lipid complex reveals two protein bands, C and D, with estimated molecular weights of approximately 17,000 and 13,000, respectively, which contain lipid and a small amount of carbohydrate; bands A and B are not present in the complex. Gel electrophoresis of the cell envelope residues after extraction of the complex with alkali and EDTA shows a single main band, corresponding to the position of band B, which contains protein, carbohydrate, and lipid; band A is completely missing. B and A is believed to be a component of the complex, which is split into two subunits on alkali solubilization.\n",
      "Purification and properties of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Escherichia coli. beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.30) has been purified from Escherichia coli K-12 to near homogeneity based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in both 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate and in 6 M urea at pH 8.5. The purified enzyme shows a pH optimum of 7.7 and the Km for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranoside is 0.43 mM. The molecular weight of this enzyme, determined by both Sephadex gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, is equivalent to 36,000. It is shown to be a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme. Studies on the substrate specificites of the purified enzyme indicate that this enzyme is an exo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase.\n",
      "Acid protease activity during germination of microcysts of the cellular slime mold Polysphondylium pallidum. Extracts of dormant microcysts of Polysphondylium pallidum demonstrate pH optima for the hydrolysis of casein at 3.5 and 6.0. During germination the intracellular pH 6.0 caseinolytic specific activity does not change significantly. The pH 6.0 protease is also active on azo-albumin, revealing the same developmental pattern with this substrate. Both acid protease activities are excreted during the germination process. Addition of purified nonspecific protease to cultures speeds up germination, suggesting that the excreted protease may play a role in removal of the microcyst wall. When cycloheximide is added to cultures, complete germination (emergence) is stopped whereas the pH 6.0 protease activity still accumulates to between 50 and 60% of the maximum control activity. Although this suggests that post-translational controls might mediate the accumulation of a portion of the pH 6.0 protease increase, mixing and dilution experiments with cell extracts do not reveal the differential presence of soluble activators or inhibitors of this activity at different developmental stages. The presence of tightly bound enzyme-inhibitor complexes for protease B in dormant microcysts has not been ruled out and is currently under study.\n",
      "Altered nutritional requirements associated with mutations affecting the structures of ribonucleic acid polymerase in Lactobacillus casei. Rifampin-resistant mutants were isolated from Lactobacillus casei S1 and examined for possible simultaneous alteration in nutritional properties. Among the 36 mutants obtained either spontaneously or after mutagenesis with 2-aminopurine, 22 were found to be altered with respect to the specific growth requirements. The majority (20 of 22) of the latter mutants were shown to require L-glutamine in addition to the nutrients required by the parental strain for maximal growth, whereas the remaining mutants had apparently lost the requirement for L-aspartate. Further studies with one of the glutamine-requiring mutants revealed that the rifampin resistance of this strain is due to the resistance of ribonucleic acid polymerase itself and that a single mutation is responsible for both rifampin resistance and the glutamine requirement. These results strongly indicate that a structural alteration of the ribonucleic acid polymerase caused by the rifampin resistance mutation somehow affected glutamine metabolism, possibly through change in selective transcription of the genes involved.\n",
      "Preparations and properties of ribonucleic acid polymerase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was purified to apparent homogeneity and its properties were compared with those of the Escherichia coli B enzyme. The molecular weights of the two native active enzymes as well as their alpha and beta subunits appeared to be similar. No subunit corresponding to that of sigma from E. coli was found, and furthermore no separation between the beta subunits could be detected by gel electrophoresis. A number of different DNAs were transcribed by the enzyme from A. calcoaceticus. Maximal RNA synthesis occurred at pH 8.7, 10 mM Mg2+, or 0.3 mM Mn2+ and at a total ionic strength of 0.1. Higher ionic strengths led to increasing inhibition of transcription and at mu = 0.4 complete inhibition was observed. The mechanism of inhibition of salt was not related to the initiation event as observed with T4 core RNA polymerase (R.Kleppe, 1975). In an attempt to understand the mechanism of inhibition by salt, the effect of ionic strength on the sedimentation properties of the enzyme was investigated. At low ionic strength, enzyme species with sedimentation coefficients, s20,w, of 5.8S, 12.4S, and 19.3S were present. In buffers with higher ionic strengths the relative amounts of the 12.4S species decreased. It is suggested, therefore, that the inhibition of activity at higher salt concentrations is caused by a decrease in concentration of the active enzyme species.\n",
      "Urea-hydrolyzing activity of a T-strain mycoplasma: Ureaplasma urealyticum. The urea-hydrolyzing activity of a T-strain mycoplasma was studied in experiments using whole cells and cell-free enzyme preparations by measuring the release of 14CO2 from [14C]urea. Under the conditions used, the urea concentration optimum is approximately 5.6 X 10(-3) M urea. The activity is soluble and not membrane bound. It is stable at -70 C for several weeks but is more labile at higher temperatures. The pH optimum is between 5.0 and 6.0. The effect of several inhibitors on the activity was tested and revealed similarities, as well as differences, between T-strain mycoplasma urease activity and the urease activity of other organisms and plants.\n",
      "Arginine decarboxylase from a Pseudomonas species. An arginine decarboxylase has been isolated from a Pseudomonas species. The enzyme is constitutive and did not appear to be repressed by a variety of carbon sources. After an approximately 40-fold purification, the enzyme appeared more similar in its properties to the Escherichia coli biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase than to the E. coli inducible (biodegradative) enzyme. The Pseudomonas arginine decarboxylase exhibited a pH optimum of 8.1 and an absolute requirement of Mg2+ and pyridoxal phosphate, and was inhibited significantly at lower Mg2+ concentrations by the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and cadaverine. The Km for L-arginine was about 0.25 mM at pH 8.1 AND 7.2. The enzyme was completely inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. The inhibition was prevented by dithiothreitol, a feature that suggests the involvement of an -SH group. Of a variety of labeled amino acids tested, only L-arginine, but not D-arginine was decarboxylated. D-Arginine was a potent inhibitor of arginine decarboxylase with a Ki of 3.2 muM.\n",
      "Derepression of certain aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes of Escherichia coli K-12 by growth in Fe3+-deficient medium. 3-Deoxy-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase, prephenate dehydratase, tryptophan synthase, and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine synthase enzyme activities are derepressed in wild-type Escherichia coli K-12 cells grown on Fe3+-deficient medium. This derepression is reversed when FeSO4 is added to the growth medium. Addition of shikimic acid to the Fe3+-deficient growth medium caused repression of the first three enzyme activities but not of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine synthase activity. Addition of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid to the Fe3+-deficient growth medium has no effect on any of the above-mentioned enzyme activities. The Fe3+ deficiency-mediated derepression of 3-deoxyarabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase activity is due to an elevation of the tyrosine-sensitive isoenzyme; the phenylalanine-sensitive isoenzyme is not derepressed under these conditions.\n",
      "Control of differentiation in streptomycetes: involvement of extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and glucose repression in aerial mycelia development. When Streptomyces alboniger spores were grown in Hickey-Tresner broth containing 5 muM ethidium bromide, a high frequency of permanently cured aerial mycelia-negative (am-) colonies was recovered. The appearance an am- colonies was time dependent: a very low frequency (0.3%) at zero time, a maximum (9 to 21%) after 2 to 5 days of growth, and a decline again to low frequencies later in the growth cycle. On agar, cured am- colonies of S. alboniger still produced puromycin. The development of aerial mycelia in S. alboniger, S. scabies, and S. coelicolor was also sensitive to glucose repression. Colonies grown on Hickey-Tresner agar containing 2% glucose remained phenotypically am- throughout the observation period. Adenine (2.5 mM or greater), and to a lesser extent adenosine and guanosine, specifically reversed the repression. The accumulation of undissociated organic acids appears to be involved in glucose repression of aerial mycelia formation. However, this does not appear to be the case with puromycin production in S. alboniger; glucose repression was observed over the pH range 5.0 to 7.5.\n",
      "Studies on cytochrome oxidase. Partial resolution of enzymes containing seven or six subunits, from yeast and beef heart, respectively. Highly active, essentially homogeneous, preparations of ferrocytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) have been obtained from both yeast and beef heart by extraction with cholate, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and replacement of cholate by Tween 20. The molecular weights of the resultant proteins equal 260 +/- 23 X 10(3) and 205 +/- 10(3); they contain seven and six different polypeptide subunits, respectively, all in equimolar amounts, with apparent molecular weights of 42.4, 34.1, 24.7, 14.6, 14.6, 12.3, 10.6 X 10(3), and 47.5, 20.4, 14.5, 14.5, 13.0, 11.0 X 10(3), respectively. By means of apolar chromatography on L-leucine coupled to agarose these enzymes can be stripped of their largest subunit(s) resulting in preparations with molecular weights of 170 +/- 17 X 10(3) and 124 +/- 20 X 10(3), and containing only five polypeptides, with the largest remaining one (molecular weight congruent to 20 X 10(3)) present in less than stoichiometric amounts. This interconversion and subunit removal has been monitored by exclusion chromatography, four systems of acrylamide gel electrophoresis--some with the protein labeled with 125I under denaturing conditions--isoelectric focusing, and hydrodynamic methods. It has virtually no effect on heme a and copper content and on the catalytic parameters of the enzymes.  We conclude that subunits I and II in enzymes from fungal, and subunit I in those from animal, sources are dispensable for the catalysis of the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by, and are probably not essential for the attatchment of prosthetic groups to, these proteins.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of crystalline methylglyoxal synthetase from Proteus vulgaris. Methylglyoxal synthetase, which catalyzes the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to methylglyoxal and inorganic phosphate, has been isolated and crystalized in good yields from Proteus vulgaris. The enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by a variety of criteria and was found to be a dimer (Mr = 135,000; s20,w = 7.2 S) composed of two apparently identical catalytic and physical properties and their interconvertible nature suggest that they do not represent true isozymes. The enzyme is specific for dihydroxyacetone phosphate and does not form methylglyoxal from glyceraldehyde 3-phophate, glyceraldehyde, or dihydroxyacetone. Nonphosphorylated analogs are neither substrates nor competive inhibitors, but a variety of phosphorylated analogs are competitive with respect to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme is inhibited by inorganic orthophosphate in a complex manner which is overcome by dihydroxyacetone phosphate in a signoidal manner\n",
      "Beef kidney 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase. Purification, characterization, and analysis of the assay. Beef kidney 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase has been purified to homogeneity. It is a single subunit protein of Mr = 34,000 +/- 2,000 with a frictional coefficient (f/f0) of about 1.1. The enzyme readily aggregates to form, apparently inactive, higher molecular weight oligomers. The very rapid loss of enzyme activity during the assay was analyzed extensively. It was found to be due to inactivation of the enzyme by the substrate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, and unrelated to enzyme turnover or oxidation of bound iron. The loss of activity was shown to be a first order decay process, and methods are given for obtaining accurate initial reaction rates under all conditions. Evidence was presented that the enzyme assumes a catalytically inactive conformation at pH 3.4, which only relatively slowly rearranges to an active form at pH 6.5; the rearrangement can be blocked by the presence of substrate. We have found that Fe2+, which is required for enzymatic activity, can equilibrate freely, albeit slowly, with the enzyme during the course of the enzyme reaction even in the presence of saturating 3-hydroxanthranilate. Under assay conditons, the Fe2+ has an apparent dissociation constant of 0.04 mM. The kinetic properties of the enzyme were found to be dramatically different in beta,beta-dimethylglutarate buffer and collidine buffer; both the rate of loss of activity during the assay and the substrate Km and Vmax were affected.\n",
      "Effects of colipase and taurodeoxycholate on the catalytic and physical properties of pancreatic lipase B at an oil water interface. A monolayer reaction system employing tripropionin and siliconized glass beads was used to study the effects of taurodeoxycholate and colipase on the catalytic activity, interfacial stability, and interfacial affinity of porcine pancreatic lipase B (EC 3.1.1.3) The stability and catalytic activity of lipase at the bead-water interface are governed by the same two ionizable groups with pKa values (in the absence of cofactors) of 5.6 and 9.3. Colipase alone or with bile salt caused only a slight perturbation of these values. At low concentrations, 0 to 0.3mM, taurodeoxycholate increases the stability of lipase by 5-fold. At higher concentrations, 0.3 to 0.8 mM, but still below its critical micelle concentration, taurodeoxycholate prevents the adsorption of lipase to the bead-water interface. This appears to be the major mechanism by which this bile salt inhibits lipolysis. Colipase exerts small positive effects on lipase stability and catalytic activity. More importantly, colipase enables the adsorption of lipase in the presence of bile salt, thereby reversing the inhibition.\n",
      "Rickettsial permeability. An ADP-ATP transport system. The obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium, Rickettsia prowazeki, has a carrier-mediated transport system for ADP and ATP. The transport of nucleotides was measured by membrane filtration assays; the assay was shown not to harm the relatively labile rickettsiae. The nucleotide transport system was shown to reside in the rickettsiae, not in the contaminating yolk sac mitochondria of the preparation. The influx of nucleotide had an activation energy of 12 to 13 kcal above 22 deg-rees (an apparent transition temperature), and 30 kcal below this value. The uptake of nucleotide was independent of the Mg2+ concentration, but was markedly stimulated by the phosphate concentration. The pH optimum of the influx of nucleotide was pH 7. The specificity of the transport system was remarkable in that it required a specific moiety in each portion of the nucleotide, i.e. an adenine base, a ribose sugar, and two or three, but not one, phosphates. Of the wide variety of compounds tested, the system could transport only ADP, ATP, and (beta, gamma-methylene) adenosine 5'-triphosphate. The influx of nucleotide was a saturable process; half-maximum velocity was achieved at a nucleotide concentration of about 75 muM. ADP and ATP were competitive inhibitors of each other's transport. Although at least 95% of the labeled intracellular nucleotide was exchangeable, efflux of labeled nucleotide was observed only in the presence of unlabeled nucleotide in the medium. Half-maximum efflux was achieved at a concentration of about 75 muM. A large intracellular to extracellular concentration gradient of labeled nucleotide was maintained in the presence of metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers, which completely abolished rickettsial hemolysis. While having no effect on the steady state, KCN and DNP accelerated both influx and efflux. Measurements of the endogenous pool of adenine nucleotides in isolated rickettsiae show that is was large (5 mM), and that these unlabeled nucleotides exchanged, on approximately a 1/1 basis, with exogenously added nucleotide. These studies support the proposal that rickettsiae are not \"leaky\" to adenine nucleotides or to small molecules in general, and that they have a carrier-mediated transport system which allows an exchange of host and parasite ADP and ATP.\n",
      "Monomeric purine nucleoside phosphorylase from rabbit liver. Purification and characterization. Rabbit liver purine nucleoside phosphorylase (purine nucleoside: orthophosphate ribosyltransferase EC 2.4.2.1.) was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography and ammonium sulfate fractionation. Homogeneity was established by disc gel electrophoresis in presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and isoelectric focusing. Molecular weights of 46,000 and 39,000 were determined, respectively, by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Product inhibition was observed with guanine and hypoxanthine as strong competitive inhibitors for the enzymatic phosphorolysis of guanosine. Respective Kis calculated were 1.25 x 10(-5) M for guanine and 2.5 x 10(-5) M for hypoxanthine. Ribose 1-phosphate, another product of the reaction, gave noncompetitive inhibition with guanosine as variable substrate, and an inhibition constant of 3.61 x 10(-4) M was calculated. The protection of essential --SH groups on the enzyme, by 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, was necessary for the maintenance of enzyme activity. Noncompetitive inhibition was observed for p-chloromercuribenzoate with an inhibition constant of 5.68 x 10(-6)M. Complete reversal of this inhibition by an excess of 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol was demonstrated. In the presence of methylene blue, the enzyme showed a high sensitivity to photooxidation and a dependence of photoinactivation on pH, strongly implicating histidine as the susceptible group at the active site of the enzyme. The pKa values determined for ionizable groups of the active site of the enzyme were near pH 5.5 and pH 8.5 The chemical and kinetic evidences suggest that histidine and cysteine may be essential for catalysis. Inorganic orthophosphate (Km 1.54 x 10(-2) M) was an obligatory anion requirement, and arsenate substituted for phosphate with comparable results. Guanosine (Km 5.00 x 10(-5) M), deoxyguanosine (Km 1.00 x 10(-4)M) and inosine (Km 1.33 x 10(-4)M), were substrates for enzymatic phosphorolysis. Xanthosine was an extremely poor substrate, and adenosine was not phosphorylyzed at 20-fold excess of the homogeneous enzyme. Guanine (Km 1.82 x 10(-5)M),ribose 1-phosphate (Km 1.34 x 10(-4) M) and hypoxanthine were substrates for the reverse reaction, namely, the enzymatic synthesis of nucleosides. The initial velocity studies of the saturation of the enzyme with guanosine, at various fixed concentrations of inorganic orthophosphate, suggest a sequential bireactant catalytic mechanism for the enzyme.\n",
      "Purification to homogeneity and properties of two D-alanine carboxypeptidases I From Escherichia coli. Three homogeneous preparations of D-alanine carboxypeptidases I have been obtained from Escherichia coli strain H2143, termed enzymes IA, IB, and IC. Enzyme IA purified from the membrane after extraction with Triton X-100 appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to be a polypeptide doublet whose monomer molecular weights were about 32,000 and 34,000. In addition to D-alanine carboxypeptidase activity, it catalyzed a transpeptidase reaction with several substrates, bound [14C]penicillin G, had a weak penicillinase activity, but was devoid of endopeptidase activity. Enzyme IB obtained from the membrane after LiCl extraction and enzyme IC obtained from the supernatant solution were either identical or extremely similar. They were composed of a single polypeptide whose monomer molecular weight was about 41,000. In addition to carboxypeptidase activity, they catalyzed an endopeptidase reaction, had weak penicillinase activity, and had very poor transpeptidase activity, but did not bind [14C]penicillin G. Some data relating to the mechanism of catalysis by these enzymes are described. Their possible physiological role is discussed.\n",
      "Effects of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate binding on the visible absorption spectrum of methemoglobin. The binding of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate to human methemoglobin causes a perturbation of the visible heme abosrption spectrum which is expressed by an increase in absorbance in the high spin band regions, 480 to 510 nm and 590 to 640 nm, concomitant with a decrease in absorbance in the alpha- and beta-band absorption regions. The pH dependence of the p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-induced difference spectrum can be accounted for quantitatively by a 5% shift toward higher spin of the aquo form of methemoglobin, a 15% shift toward higher spin of the hydroxide form, and a shift in the apparent pKa for the water to hydroxide transition from 7.92 to 8.04 when mercurial is bound. The rate of these heme abosrbance changes is consistent with the rapid second order formation of the beta93 cysteine, mercury-mercaptide bond and does not represent a change due to the dissociation of methemoglobin tetramers into dimers, even though the latter, slow process does follow mercurial binding. The observation of an increase in spin produced by the binding of a reagent which also promotes dimer formation argues strongly against any direct correlation between an increase in spin and the appearance of deoxyhemoglobin-like conformations.\n",
      "Binding of inositol hexaphosphate to human methemoglobin. The observed static difference spectrum produced by inositol hexaphosphate binding to methemoglobin is the sum of a very fast and a slow spectral transition. The more rapid absorbance change is too fast to be measured by stopped flow techniques, whereas the slow change exhibits a half-time in the range 1 to 6 s. From the pH dependence of the rapidly formed difference spectrum and from a series of heme ligand binding studies, the rapid phase is interpreted to reflect a localized tertiary conformational change which immediately accompanies inositol hexaphosphate binding and results in a selective increase in spin and reactivity of the beta chain heme groups. In contrast, the slow phase appears to reflect a first order isomerization process which involves only a small portion (less than 10%) of the hemoglobin molecules and results primarily in a marked alteration of the spectral properties of the alpha chains with little change in spin. While the rapid spectral transition cannot be directly related to the overall quaternary transition which occurs during oxygen binding to ferrous deoxyhemoglobin, the slow spectral transition may represent the abortive formation of a deoxyhemoglobin A-like conformation which is inhibited in both rate and extent by the presence of water molecules bound to the heme iron atoms.\n",
      "Molecular size of nerve growth factor in dilute solution. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a protein composed of two identical chains of mass 13,259. An analysis of the sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity, and gel filtration behavior of dilute solutions of NGF indicates the existence of a rapidly reversible monomer in equilibrium dimer equilibrium and that the association constant K for the reaction at neutral pH is 9.4 X 10(6)M-1. Reaction mixtures consist of equal concentrations of monomer and dimer at a total protein concentration as high as 1.4 mug/ml, and at 1 ng/ml, monomer accounts for greater than 99% of the total. The latter concentration is 20 to 30 times that required for the biological activity of NGF. Several lines of evidence suggest that the dimerization reaction is highly stereospecific, although its biological significance is not known.\n",
      "Carbon 13 resonances of 13CO2 carbamino adducts of alpha and beta chains in human adult hemoglobin. The principal component of normal adult human hemoglobin Ao, was equilibrated under various conditions with 13CO2. In addition, derivatives containing specifically carbamylated NH2-terinal groups in alpha or beta chains, or both, were prepared by treatment with cyanate, and equilibrated likewise to allow the identification of specific resonances observed by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. In deoxyhemoglobin, a resonanance at 29.2 ppm upfield of external CS2 was assigned to the alpha chain terminal adduct, and one at 29.8 ppm to the beta chain terminal adduct. In the liganded state as the CO derivative, the terminal adduct on both chains showed a common resonance position at 29.8 ppm. Small effects of pH on the resonance positions were observed. Under certain conditions, a resonance was observed at 33.4 ppm, probably not ascribable to a carbamino compound. A carbamino resonance that became prominent at higher pH was found at 28.4 ppm, and is tentatively ascribed to one or more adducts on epsilon amino groups. The beta chain resonances in particular are minimized by the presence of inositol hexaphosphate or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Quantitative analysis of the resonance intensities shows that the effects of conversion from the deoxy to the liganded state in reducing the degree of carbamino adduct is much more pronounced for the beta than for the alpha chains.\n",
      "Purine nucleotide cycle. Evidence for the occurrence of the cycle in brain. Cell-free extracts of rat brain catalyze the reactions of the purine nucleotide cycle. Ammonia is formed during the deamination but not the amination phase of the cycle. The activity of adenylate deaminase in brain is sufficient to account for the maximum rates of ammonia production that have been reported. The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase is not sufficient to account for these rates of ammonia production. The activities of adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinase are nearly sufficient to account for the steady state rates of ammonia production observed in brain. Demonstration of the cycle in extracts of brain is complicated by the occurrence of side reactions, in particular those catalyzed by phosphomonoesterase, nucleoside phosphorylase, and guanase.\n",
      "Kinetics of alpha-chymotrypsin dimerization. A method has been devised which permits the observation of the loss of active sites promoted by aggregation of alpha-chymotrypsin. When alpha-chymotrypsin in unbuffered solution at pH 7 is mixed with buffered proflavin by stopped flow instrumentation to give a final pH of 3.89, a decrease in active sites occurs, as measured by a decrease in enzyme-dye complex. The decrease in the rate of active sites shows a linear dependence on the square of the concentration of active sites remaining at equilibrium. The kinetic data of the reaction have been correlated with equilibrium measurements. Rate constants for formation and dissociation of dimer are 9.45 X 10(3) M(-1)S(-1) and 1.9 S(-1),, respectively. Calculation of Kdis for dimer from rate constants gives a value of 2.01 X 10(-4) M, while direct determination of Kdis gives a value of 1.44 X 10(-4) M.\n",
      "Serum stimulation of phosphate uptake into 3T3 cells. The stimulation by calf serum of phosphate uptake into 3T3 cells results from a change in maximum velocity of the transport process with no change in the Michaelis constant. Only arsenate among a series of inorganic structural analogs of phosphate inhibited phosphate uptake indicating a high specificity for the process. The arsenate inhibition was competitive in nature. Papaverine, theophylline, and protaglandin E1, drugs known to maintain high intracellular levels of cAMP, had little effect on serum stimulated phosphate uptake. The phosphate uptake stimulating factor(s) in serum could be distinguised from the 3T3 cell survival and migration factors by stability characteristics, but this factor(s) could not be completely separated from a uridine uptake stimulation activity or growth promoting activity using a variety of serum fractionation procedures. Only partial stimulation of the uptake process was achieved with any one serum fraction indicating a multiplicity of serum components is probably involved in this process. Because of the rapidity of serum activation of phosphate uptake and its apparent independence of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels, it is suggested that serum factors may stimulate phosphate uptake by inducing structural changes in the phosphate carrier system.\n",
      "Dinoflagellate bioluminescence: a comparative study of invitro components. In vitro bioluminescence components of the dinoflagellates Gonyaulax polyedra, G. tamarensis, Dissodinium lunual, and Pyrocystis noctiluca were studied. The luciferases and luciferins of the four species cross-react in all combinations. All of these species possess high-molecular weight luciferases (200,000-400,000 daltons) with similar pH activity profiles. The active single chains of luciferases from the Gonyaulax species have a MW of 130,000 while those from P. noctiluca and D. lunula have a MW of 60,000. Extractable luciferase activity varies with time of day in the two Gonyaulax species, but not in the other two. A luciferin binding protein (LBP) can easily be extracted from the two Gonyaulax species (MW approximately 120,000 daltons), but none could be detected in extracts of either D. lunula or P. noctiluca. Scintillons are extractable from all four species, but they vary in density and the degree to which activity can be increased by added luciferin. Although the biochemistry of bioluminescence in these dinoflagellates is generally similar, the observations that D. lunula and P. noctiluca apparently lack LBP and have luciferases with low MW single chains require further clarification.\n",
      "Control of phenylalanine hydroxylase synthesis in tissue culture by serum and insulin. Stationary-phase, minimal deviation hepatoma H4-II-E-C3 cell cultures that are serum-deprived respond with a biphasic time course of phenylalanine hydroxylase induction when dialyzed fetal calf serum or insulin is added. These two agents induce phenylalanine hydroxylase additively, during both the initial 3-hour and the delayed 24-hour phases. The initial phase of induction by insulin is inhibited by cycloheximide but not by actinomycin D. The delayed induction by both dialyzed fetal calf serum and insulin is inhibited by 10(-6) M cycloheximide and 0.20 mug/ml actinomycin D. H4-II-E-C3 cells in culture do not synthesize the factor(s) in serum that induce phenylalanine hydroxylase.\n",
      "Effect of lumbar sympathetic blockade and chlorpromazine-induced adrenergic alpha-receptor blockade on skin temperature in peripheral arterial diseases. The post-cooling toe temperature changes after lumbar sympathetic blockade and after intramuscular administration of an adrenergic alpha-receptor blocking substance (chlorpromazine) were studied in 14 patients with impending gangrene because of peripheral arterial insufficiency. The post-cooling temperature rise was similar after sympathetic blockage and chlorpromazine administration and significantly different from the basal toe temperature changes after cooling. It is concluded that administration of an adrenergic alpha-receptor blocking substance is as good as the lumbar sympathetic blockage for evaluation of a remaining sympathetic vasomotor tone in arterial disease patients.\n",
      "High-speed ion-pair partition chromatography in pharmaceutical analysis. Ion-pair chromatography offers attractive possibilities in pharmaceutical analysis. The specificity of the separation systems can be varied over a wide range by appropriate selection of the stationary phase. The choice of a suitable counter-ion can also drastically improve the detection limit, permitting the determination of drug substances in low dosage and possibly of by-products or breakdown products. Ion-pair chromatography of tropane and ergot alkaloids has been investigated using picrate as counter-ion. Alumina, Kieselguhr and various grades of silica gel have been tested as supports. Partition properties studied in a batch procedure have been compared with the actual chromatographic conditions. Columns (10 cm) filled with silical gel (particle size, 5 mum; pore size, 1000 A) show the best performance in the separation of hyoscyamine, scopolamine and ergotamine as picrate ion-pairs. Close control of pH and temperature is essential for reproducible separations. Improvements in detection limits between 100 and 300 times have been observed with these systems. Ion-pair extractions of these alkaloids from dosage forms can be used for sample preparation prior to injection on the the column. This provides an added degree of selectivity and sensitivity.\n",
      "Analytical separation of amino acids on a cation-exchange resin cross-linked with m-divinylbenzene. The elution bands of acidic and neutral amino acids of protein hydrolysates, emerging from the column of a cation-exchange resin cross-linked with pure m-divinylbenzene, are narrower than those from a resin prepared from styrene and technical divinylbenzene. As a result of these narrower bands, a more complete resolution of the critical pairs threonine-serine, glycine-alanine and tyrosine-phenylalanine is obtained. The most probable reason for the narrower elution peaks is the more rapid diffusion of the exchanged components through the bulk of the resin as a result of a more regular arrangement of cross-linkages in the cation-exchange resin prepared from m-divinylbenzene.\n",
      "[Template chromatography on immobilized oligonucleotides. Synthesis and application of oligodeoxyadenosine-5'-phosphate--DEAE-cellulose (author's transl)]. Oligomers of deoxyadenylic acid, obtained by polycondensation, were covalently attached to polyvinyl alcohol. These polymer-bound oligonucleotides undergo very strong adsorption on DEAE-cellulose such that at neutral pH and with 1 M NaCl, partial desorbtion occurs only above 60 degrees. The use of this PV(pA)n-DEAE-cellulose for the column chromatographic separation of deoxythymidylic acid oligomers obtained by polycondensation, according to the principle of base-pairing, is discussed. Linear oligomers and also pyrophosphate derivatives of thymidylic acid which contain more than five monomer units undergo strong retardation under the conditions of base-pairing. Cyclic oligonucleotides do not show any noticeable interaction with the stationary phase. Thus, through the use of a temperature gradient, it is possible to fractionally separate the polycondensate, giving an average degree of polymerisation of 6--10.\n",
      "A rapid and comprehensive system for the routine identification of drugs in biological material based on microphase extraction and drug colour profiles. The separation of basic, acidic and neutral drugs from propanol-2 extracts of serum, urine and tissue homogenates at different pH values using a micro-phase extraction technique is described. Following preliminary screening, the various drug-containing fractions obtained are further examined by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. The drugs present are identified with reference to documented standards with the aid of a drug colour profile system and RF values relative to three different reference standards. By means of gas chromatographic analysis of the same extracts, semi-quantitative estimates of the amounts of drugs present, which are sufficiently accurate for clinical emergency purposes, can be made in many instances. The main advantages of the system are \"clean\" extracts with a minimum of background interference, rapidity (4-6 h for a complete analysis) and systematically documented and visually presented behaviour of drugs after spraying with various chromogenic and fluorogenic reagents, allowing the systematic identification of unknown substances.\n",
      "Chromatographic behaviour of alkaloids on thin layers of anion and cation exhangers. I. AG 1-X4 and cellex D. The chromatographic behaviour of 48 alkaloids has been studied on Bio-Rad AG 1-X4, Cellex D and microcrystalline cellulose, eluting with solutions of different pH but constant ionic strength (0.5). Many interesting separations were effected on both AG 1-X4 and Cellex D layers. The influence of pH on the chromatographic behaviour of alkaloids has been quantitatively studied and an equation was used that expresses the behaviour of the alkaloids on both AG 1-X4 (AcO-) and microcrystalling cellulose layers. The nonapplicability of this equation to Cellex D layers is discussed.\n",
      "Determination of trimethylsilyl methylated nucleic acid bases in urine by gas-liquid chromatography. A method for the determination of the urinary excretion level of methylated nucleic acid bases by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) has been developed. A clean-up procedure prior to GLC analysis consisted of hydrolysis, filtration, charcoal adsorption, and anion exchange. Studies to determine optimum derivatization conditions for conversion of the methylated bases to their trimethylsilyl derivatives and to evaluate GLC parameters and columns to obtain the best separation were conducted. Application of the method was shown by determining the excretion levels of methylated bases in urine of normal controls and of patients with various types of malignancy.\n",
      "High-resolution liquid chromatographic analysis of methylated purine and pyrimidine bases in transfer RNA. Methylated and major purine and pyrimidine bases were separated and quantified by high-resolution liquid chromatography after hydrolyzing transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs). Separation was accomplished by eluting the hydrolyzed samples from an anion-exchange column with a concentration gradient of ammonium acetate at pH 9.2. Isolated sample of tRNA were hydrolyzed to the free bases with a trifluoroacetic acid-formic acid mixture of 200 degrees. Detection limits of 100-200 ng/ml were measured for the methylated bases; analytical data are reported for ten methylated bases plus the four major bases of calf liver and rat liver tRNA.\n",
      "A new gas chromatographic method for the estimation of reserpine and rescinnamine. Under the conditions described for alkaline hydrolysis of reserpine and rescinnamine in absolute and aqueous methanol, and after esterification (with diazomethane) of the resulting acid fraction, methyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate was quantitatively recovered, whereas methyl trans-3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamate, in normal lighting conditions, was either partly isomerized to methyl cis-trimethoxycinnamate or formed an adduct with a molecule of methanol, yielding methyl 3-methoxy-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propionate. The structures of the products were established by synthesis, nuclear magnetic resonance studies and mass spectrometry. This investigation of the hydrolytic conditions allowed a reliable and rapid gas chromatographic determination of reserpine and/or rescinnamine in amounts down to 500 and 2000 mug, respectively, to be devised.\n",
      "Specific ion-exchange chromatography and fluorimetric assay for urinary 3-O-methyldopamine. A technique for the selective extraction of 3-O-methyldopamine, normetanephrine and metanephrine from a single urine sample has been investigated. After hydrolysis of the conjugates, the diluted mixture is passed through a Dowex 50W-X2 column and the methoxylated amines are eluted by means of concentrated ammonia. The eluate, containing metanephrine, normetanephrine and 3-O-methyldopamine is evaporated, and a solution of the residue in borate buffer is fractionated under strictly controlled conditions on an Amberlite CG-50 column. The three amines so separated are estimated by specific fluorimetric methods. The extraction recovery is 80 +/- 3% for pure solutions and 78 +/- 4% for 3-O-methyldopamine added to urine. The fluorimetric procedure, carried out under well-defined conditions, allows the estimation of 10 ng of 3-O-methethyldopamine. The spectral characteristics of the fluorescent derivative are similar to those obtained with dopamine, so that it can be assumed that iodine oxidation of 3-O-methyldopamine demethylates this compound and oxidises the resulting dopamine to the dopamine fluorophore (5,6-dihydroxy-indole). Of the compounds that might interfere in the fluorimetric procedure, dopamine, DOPA and alpha-methyl-DOPA are destroyed by the ammoniacal elution from the Dowex column and 3-O-methyl-DOPA is eliminated in the effluent from the Amberlite column. The elimination of interfering compounds and the improved separation on Amberlite ensure high specificity for this procedure. We have applied the method to normal urine and to pathological urines from patients with adrenergic tumours or untreated and treated parkinsonian subjects; vital information has been obtained on the prognosis of adrenergic tumours. The presence of large amounts of dopamine, normetanephrine and/or metanephrine does not affect the assay for 3-O-methyldopamine. The method is also applicable to rat and dog urine, and can be applied to tissue extracts with little modification.\n",
      "Analysis of the radioimmunoassay for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH): studies on the effect of radioiodinated GnRH. When GnRH is radioiodinated by the chloramine-T method, two immunoreactive labeled species are formed at pH 6.5 with a chloramine-T: GnRH molar ratio of 11:1, whereas four bands (I, IIa, IIb, and III) are separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when the hormone is iodinated at pH 7.5 in a system containing a 97:1 molar ratio of chloramine-T:GnRH. Because they were more stable and were more immunoreactive than the other products, band I and band IIa from the latter system were used separately as tracers with Niswender antiserum R-42 in radioimmunoassays for GnRH. The standard curves of each tracer are distinct: when analyzed after log-logit transformation, the band I curve had a mean slope of -3.31 +/- 0.2 (SE) and a 50% B/Bt level of 9 +/- 0.8 pg (n=8) of synthetic GnRH, whereas the band IIa standard curve had a slope of -2.30 +/- 0.6 and a 50% B/Bt value of 20 +/- 0.9 pg (n=11). The sensitivity of both assays is approximately 2.0 pg. Gn RH concentrations in plasma and serum samples assayed with band I were consistently greater than those assayed with band IIa. Normal adult male plasmas assayed with band I measured 21 +/- 0.9 pg/ml, whereas band IIa values were 8 +/- 0.4 pg/ml. No difference between plasma and serum was detected, nor was there any difference among adult men, adult women, prepubertal children, hypogonadal patients, or hypopituitary patients with either assay. Plasma GnRH concentrations were also similar in jugular and vena cava samples from intact and castrated male rats. Because many of the samples were at or below the sensitivity of the band IIa assay, they were concentrated after extraction with either methanol or acid-ethanol. However, endogenous immunoreactive GnRH could not be concentrated by these extraction procedures. As measured in the band IIa assay, hypothalamic extracts from control adult male rats contained 3.1 +/- 0.4 ng while hypothalami from castrated rats contained 1.4 +/- 0.1 ng. Similar but slightly lower values were obtained with band I. In contrast, the GnRH content of pineal glands from intact and castrated male rats was similar (approximately 150 pg) when determined in either assay. These studies emphasize that: 1) the characteristics of the radioiodinated hormone can influence the quantitation of GnRH; and 2) endogenous plasma concentrations of GnRH are much lower than previously reported.\n",
      "Counterimmunoelectrophoresis of pneumococcal antigens:improved sensitivity for the detection of types VII and XIV. Rapid identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae has been reported using counterimmunoelectrophoresis for the detection of specific capsular antigens in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. Previous clinical studies have failed to detect type VII or XIV pneumococcal antigen. These two types, however, account for a significant portion of pneumococcal disease. The incorporation of a sulfonated derivative of phenylboronic acid in the buffer system provides a method for the sensitive detection of these types in artificial mixtures without greatly reducing the sensitivity for the detection of other pneumococcal types. A problem with false positives encountered using human serum and barbitalbuffer was reduced by the use of buffer containing sulfonated phenylboronic acid.\n",

      "Rapid screening of Veillonella by ultraviolet fluorescence. Among 51 strains of anaerobic gram-negative cocci belonging to the family Veillonellaceae, all strains of Veillonella (V. parvula and V. alcalescens) displayed red fluorescence under long-wave (366 nm) ultraviolet light, whereas no Acidaminococcus or Megasphaera demonstrated fluorescence. In contrast to Bacteroides melaninogenicus, growth of Veillonella does not require hemin and menadione, and flourescence is rapidly lost upon exposure to air. The fluorescent component of a strain of V. parvula examined could not be extracted in solution with water, ether, methanol, or chloroform, but was readily extracted with 0.4 N NaOH. Spectrophotofluorometrically, the fluorescence maximum of this extract was 660 nm with an excitation maximum of 300 nm, when measured at pH 7.2 and 25 C. Coupled with the Gram stain, ultraviolet fluorescence may be a  useful tool for rapid screening of Veillonella and is particularly helpful for detection and, isolation of this organism from mixed culture.\n",

      "Distribution and removal of added mercury in milk. Distribution patterns of added mercury in raw whole milk after equilibration for 30 min and 2 h at 37 C showed a distribution among acid casein, whey proteins, fat globule membrane, and soluble fat globule membrane of 33, 28, 16, and 2%. On the basis of protein content, the fat globule membrane had the highest amount of mercury. Mercury added to milk as mercuric chloride was removed by treatment with thiolated aminoethyl celluloses and reduced human hair. In a 5 min treatment, 70, 43, and 41% of the mercury was removed by thiosuccinylated aminoethyl cellulose, thionitrocarboxyphenylated aminoethyl cellulose, and reduced human hair, respectively, from whole milk initially containing 1 ppm mercury and equilibrated for 2 h at 37 C prior to treatment. After treatment for 60 min, 82, 52, and 64% of the mercury was removed by thiosuccinilated aminoethyl cellulose, thionitrocarboxyphenylated aminoethyl cellulose, and reduced hair, respectively. However, increasing incubation temperature and time prior to treatment decreased the removal efficiencies. Thiosuccinilated aminoethyl cellulose and reduced human hair showed increasing efficiency directly with pH, while thionitrocarboxyphenylated aminoethyl cellulose showed the opposite effect and had higher affinity for mercury at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.5. Moreover, the rate of removal of mercury at 4 C compared to 37 C was much slower. The removal of mercury from soluble casein and soluble whey proteins was more efficient than from micellar casein. Protein, lactose content, and pH of milk were not changed by the polymer treatments.\n",
      "Demonstration of a nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system in the trachea of the guinea pig. A nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system has been demonstrated in the guinea pig trachea. Electrical field stimulation of this system, in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine. The relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin, which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation. The gastrointestinal tract, which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract, also has a nonadrenergic inhibitory system. In the gastrointestinal tract, this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis, and absence of this system, in the colon and the rectum, is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in Hirschsprung's disease. It is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory nonadrenergic inhibitory system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreactive airways in asthma. The airways, due to a lack of inhibition, may be either partially contracted or unable to relax, and thus appear hyperreactive to stimuli.\n",
      "Non-specific alkaline phosphomonoesterases of eight species of digenetic trematodes. Alkaline phosphatases from different trematodes occupying the same habitat have identical pH otima but different levels of enzyme activities. Isoparorchis hypselobagri, from the fish Wallago attu, shows four to six times more enzyme activity than Fasciolopsis buski, Gastrodiscoides hominis and Echinostoma malayanum, from the pig Sus scrofa, and Fasciola gigantica, Gigantocotyle explanatum, Cotylophoron cotylophorum and Gastrothylax crumenifer, from the buffalo Bubalus bubalis. At least two peaks of activity at different levels of pH were obtained for each trematode examined. Both Gastrodiscoides hominis and Isoparorchis hypselobagri enzymes had three peaks of alkaline phosphatase activity. The optimum temperature for maximum enzyme activity was 40 degrees C, above which rapid inactivation occurred. At temperatures below 40 degrees C, the enzymes of fish and mammalian trematodes did not behave similarly; I. hypselobagri enzyme being active over a wider range of temperature (20 degrees-40 degrees C. Various concentrations of KCN and arsenate proportionately inhibited enzyme activity. NaF Did not significantly influence enzyme activity, while Mg++ and Co++ acted as activators. The extent of inhibition or activation of enzyme activity of different trematodes varied, probably due to species differences. Both inhibition and activation of I. hypselobagri enzyme was higher than in the case of other trematodes.\n",
      "The effect of neonatal rat graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) on Fc receptor lymphocytes. The level  of Fc receptor rosette-forming lymphocytes (Fc-RFL) was examined in spleen and lymph node cell suspension from neonatal DA and BN rats inoculated within 24 hr of birth with either allogeneic L (experimental) or syngeneic (control) lymphoid cells. In addition, these levels were compared to fetal and neonatal animals that received no injection. The indicator cells (EA) were sheep erythrocytes sensitized with one-half concentration of the highest dilution of rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte IgG(A) which agglutinated an equal amount of 1% suspension of E. Care was taken to exclude scoring macrophages by injecting colloidal carbon at least 1 hr before killing the test animals. The spleen of 19-day DA fetal rats exhibited a level of 19.3% Fc-RFL, similar to that of animals having received adult syngeneic cells at birth (40.0%) by day 7. Thereafter the level of Fc-RFL did not vary appreciably between these two groups. However, as early as 2 days after inoculation there was a significantly greater number of Fc-RFL in the spleen of experimental DA neonates compared to controls. The lymph nodes of experimental animals did not exhibit a significantly greater number of Fc-RFL until day 6 with both tissue compartments peaking at day 10 and remaining significantly higher than controls until death. In neonatal BN animals significantly higher levels of Fc-RFL in experimental animals were not evident as early and peaked later (day 12) in both tissue compartments but again these differences remained until death. Cytotoxic alloantisera demonstrated that on days 6, 10, and 12 most, if not all, of the Fc-RFL were host in origion in both DA and BN GVHD, with a very significant host plasma cell response in such GVHD animals. One-micron tissue section revealed the presence of a great number of plasma cell especially prominent in the medulla of lymph nodes with the cortex of lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen markedly depleted of lymphocytes indicative of cytotoxicity.\n",
      "Kinetics of the antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III). I. Use of 125I-labeled SSS-III to study serum antibody levels, as well as the distribution and excretion of antigen after immunization. A simple method was described for the preparation of 125I-labeled type III neumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III) with a high specific radioactivity which retained the physical and immunologic properties of native SSS-III. SSS-III was used to study the serum and tissue levels of antigen, as well as its excretion, after i.p. injection. When an optimally immunogenic dose (0.5 mug) of antigen was given, greater than 90% of the injected antigen was excreted during the first 3 days after injection; however, after day 3, the SSS-III which remained in each mouse was firmly bound to various tissues, and less than 5 ng SSS-III was released into the circulation daily. SSS-III was also used in a Farr test to measure serum antibody levels; the kinetics for the appearance of PFC/spleen and serum antibody levels were measured at 24-hr intervals after immunization with 0.5 mug of antigen. Maximum PFC/spleen were observed on day 4 after immunization whereas the peak serum antibody level was seen on day 5. The decay of serum antibody level from its maximum value was much slower than that of the PFC/spleen. The data describing the distribution of SSS-III in vivo and the measurement of serum antibody levels indicated that treadmill neutralization was not a factor in determining the serum antibody levels after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of SSS-III.\n",
      "Kinetics of the antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. II. Factors influencing the serum antibody levels after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of antigen. When the number of PFC present in the spleen was measured at 24-hr intervals after immunizing with an optimally immunogenic dose of type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III), maximal numbers of PFC were attained 4 days after immunization; thereafter, the number of PFC decreased rapidly. By contrast, serum antibody levels, which were measured in the same mice using a Farr test, reached peak values 5 days after immunization and then declined much more slowly than did the number of PFC. Two factors were found to contribute to this disparity. First, experiments conducted with splenectomized mice showed that extrasplenic antibody synthesis, which began between days 3 and 4 after immunization and peaked on days 6 to 7, accounted for nearly one-third of the total amount of serum antibody produced. Second, the average rate of antibody synthesis by PFC increased through day 6 after immunization and then declined. Antigen-antibody dissociation tests showed that the avidity of the serum antibody obtained 4 to 7 days after immunization was the same. Moreover, during the same interval, all the antibody detected by the Farr test was of the IgM class. Thus, a change in avidity or class of immunoglobulin after day 5 did not account for the disparity observed. The clearance rate of antibody injected i.v. into nonimmune and immunized mice was studied. The data obtained indicated that accelerated clearance of antibody was occurring prior to day 3 after immunization; however, after day 3 the antibody clearance rate was constant and was the same as that found when antibody was injected into nonimmune mice. These findings affirmed the results of previous studies showing that treadmill neutralization was not important in determining the serum antibody levels present after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of SSS-III.\n",
      "Mouse epidermal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase. Mouse skin contains a NADPH-dependent, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), which is inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In general, unsubstituted polycyclic hydrocarbons caused a greater induction of epidermal AHH than substituted one (1,2,3,4-dibenzanthracene greater than 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene greater than benz (a)anthracene equal 3-methylcholanthrene greater than 7,12-dimethlbenz (a)anthracene) which did not correlate with their ability to initiate tumors in mouse skin. Two different techniques were used to isolate epidermis and similar results were obtained with both. However, the technique of isolating epidermis using a mild heat treatment required that the temperature be maintained at 52 degrees C for 30 sec. If the temperature was raised to 54 degrees C or above, there was a large reduction in the AHH activity. Isolated epidermis has 4 to 5 times the AHH activity as dermis and about twice that of whole skin. This was true for control mice or mice in which AHH was induced by pretreatment with benz(a)anthracene.\n",
      "Defects in the biochemistry of collagen in diseases of connective tissue. The collagens are the major structural glycoproteins of connective tissues. A unique primary structure and a multiplicity of post-translational modification reactions are required for normal fibrillogenesis. The post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues, glycosylation, folding of the molecule into triple-helical conformation, proteolytic conversion of precursor procollagen to collagen, and oxidative deamination of certain lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues. Any defect in the normal mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules into extracellular fibers could result in abnormal fibrillogenesis; such defects could result in a connective tissue disease. Recently, defects in the regulation of the types of collagen synthesized and in the enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications have been found in heritable diseases of connective tissue. Thus far, the primary heritable disorders of collagen metabolism in man include lysyl hydroxylase deficiency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI, p-collagen peptidase deficency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII, decreased synthesis of type III collagen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, lysyl oxidase deficency in S-linked cutis laxa and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type V, and decreased synthesis of type I collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta.\n",
      "Some properties of proteolysis by polymorphonuclear leukocyte-granule extracts. The extracts of granules of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes hydrolyzed a variety of proteins including human and bovine hemoglobin, human fibrinogen, human and bovine serum albumin, bovine elastin, and casein. The hydrolysis of all the proteins except fibrinogen and elastin was increased by addition of urea. Various inhibitors of trypsin, kallikrein, plasmin, Clr, Cls, and other proteolytic enzymes had no inhibitory effect. Slight inhibition was observed with polyanethol sulfonate and strong inhibition with normal human serum. Serum of patients with hereditary angioneurotic edema having no functional C1-esterase inhibitor was as effective in inhibiting the proteolysis as normal serum. The inhibitor was localized in 4S fractions of normal serum fractionated on Sephadex G-200. Fractionation of normal serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-200 filtration, and CM-Sephadex chromatography did not result in appearance of inhibitory activity in more than one protein peak, suggesting the possibility that only one inhibitor might be responsible. Since all fractions which contained the inhibitor of proteolysis also contained alpha1-antitrypsin, since sera of patients having low alpha1-antitrypsin levels contained less inhibitory activity, and since antibodies against alpha1-antitrypsin reversed the inhibition obtained from normal serum, the inhibition of proteolysis may be attributed to alpha1-antitrypsin.\n",
      "Inhibition of the antibacterial activity of gentamicin by urine. Urinary levels of antibiotics determine the outcome of treatment of most urinary tract infections. The antibacterial effect of gentamicin against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urine was studied. With use of urinary constituents in concentrations normally found in human urine, it was shown that urine has an inhibitory effect that is dependent upon the acidity and total osmolality of the urine, as well as upon the presence of individual solutes. Up to 40 times as much gentamicin may be needed to prevent the growth of E. coli or P. aeruginosa in concentrated, acidic human urine as is required in broth. This inhibitory effect may be particularly important when urinary concentrations of gentamicin are reduced either because of a reduction in dosage or because of decreased excretion due to renal insufficiency.\n",
      "The polysaccharide capsule of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis: immunochemical and morphologic definition. A large-molecular-weight capsular polysaccharide was isolated from strains of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies fragilis. By means of electron microscopy and staining with ruthenium red, the thick polysaccharide capsule was also visualized. With use of a radioactive antigen-binding assay, antibody to this capsular polysaccharide was demonstrated in antisera prepared in rabbits to each of eight strains of B. fragilis fragilis. Antibody of similar specificity was not found in antisera prepared to Bacteroides melaninogenicus or to strains of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies vulgatus and Bacteroides fragilis subspecies distasonis; such antibody was found in antisera to only one of two strains of Bacteroides fragilis subspecies thetaiotaomicron. The radioactive antigen-binding assay is a sensitive test for the detection of antibody to capsular polysaccharide. This polysaccharide antigen may form the basis of a serogrouping system for B. fragilis.\n",
      "Radioassay for serum and red cell folate. A simple, reliable assay for serum and red cell folate is described. It uses plain untreated liquid or powdered milk, requiring no special handling or purification, as binder. Such milk makes it possible to ignore endogenous serum folate binder, since crude (but not purified) milk contains a factor which releases folate from serum binder. It simplifies counting radioactivity by employing a gamma emitting isotope of pteroylglutamic acid (PGA), namely the 125I-tyramide of PGA. Like the 3H-PGA assay of Givas and Gutcho, it permits the use of stable PGA rather than unstable methyltetrahydrofolic acid (MeTHFA) standards, because it is carried out at pH 9.3, a pH at which milk folate binder is unable to distinguish PGA from MeTHFA, which is the predominat folate in human tissues. The equipment required to do the radioassay is present in most diagnostic chemistry laboratories. Results are essentially identical to the generally accepted Lactobacillus casel microbiologic method of folate assay, except that false low results are not produced in the radioassay by antibiotics, tranquilizers, and chemotherapeutic agents. Three caveats in its use are the relative instability of 125I-PGA as compared to 3H-PGA, the fact that various powdered milks differ widely in folate-binding capacity, and that only about 60 per cent of commercially obtained skim or powdered milk preparations appear to contain the substance which splits folate from serum binder.\n",
      "The effect of environmental pH on glycosaminoglycan metabolism by normal human chondrocytes. The synthesis and release of sulfated glycosaminoglycans by normal human chondrocytes in culture are markedly affected by environmental pH. The biosynthetic rate is increased threefold as the pH of the growth medium is raised from 7.0 to 8.0. This coincides with a corresponding elevation in total protein and cell growth. The rate of release of newly synthesized sulfated glycosaminoglycans from the cell layer as well as their distribution between intra- and extracellular localization in the cell layer is also modulated by environmental pH. At pH 8, 35 per cent is found within the cells, this value is reduced to 13 per cent at pH 7. Pulse-chase experiments showed that previously incorporated sulfated proteoglycans were released at a faster rate at pH 7 than at pH 8. The data suggest that proton concentrations affect the biosynthesis and the mode of distribution of newly synthesized sulfated glycosaminoglycans.\n",
      "Effect of PGA1, PGE2, diazoxide on myocardial contractile force. Experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs comparing the effects of PGA1, PGE2, and diazoxide on myocardial contractile force (MC). The three agents were given in successive bolus injections intravenously in equidepressor doses and myocardial contractile force was measured by means of a strain-gauge arch sutured onto the right ventricle. The drugs were administered before and during ganglionic (hexamethonium) and beta-blockade (practolol). Both PGA1, and PGE2 caused a marked rise in MC, 24 and 20 per cent, respectively, before blockade and 10 and 11 per cent during blockade. Diazoxide caused only a minimal rise, 0.9 per cent, before blockade and a marked fall, 27 per cent, during blockade. Diazoxide administration during left ventricular bypass indicates that the decrease in MC is not a direct result of alterations in preload or after load. It is suggested that hypertensive patients treated with autonomic blocking agents may be more susceptible to heart failure in response to diazoxide therapy.\n",
      "Peptide-binding macromolecules in the blood of seriously ill or mentally retarded patients. This report describes macromolecules that bind (des-aspartic acid1)-angiotensin II, the des aspartic acid1 derivative of angiotensin I, and several biologically active and inactive analogues of these polypeptides. The macromolecules were found in the plasma of approximately 2 per cent of ambulatory adults and hospitalized children and 32 per cent of the patients at two institutions for the mentally retarded. The binding properties of these macromolecules were studied by incubating with peptides labeled with 125iodine, and separating bound from free labeled peptide using small gel filtration columns. The peptide-binding macromolecules from several patients were compared. They showed very similar specificity for a group of arginyl peptides of the des-aspartyl1-angiotensin sequence. The plasma binders differed from one another in their optimum pH and their mobility in electrophoretic fields. Those with more acid pH optima displayed more rapid electrophoretic mobility. The binders fell into two classes based on apparent molecular weight, approximately 140,000 and 250,000. Those with the higher apparent molecular weight contained a large proportion of binder that could be precipitated with antiserum to human IgA. Kinetic measurements showed that the plasma binders were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to affinity for (des-asp1)-angiotensin, with apparent association constants ranging from 10(7) to 10(8) M-1. Binding activity was labile to heat, and to treatment with pepsin or trypsin. It was inhibited by calcium, protamine, streptomycin, and some other cationic compounds. The plasma peptide binder differed in specificity and molecular weight from soluble angiotensin-binding molecules extracted from tissues, and from properties expected of a receptor for angiotensin. These macromolecules may be useful reagents for measuring (des-asp1)-angiotensins. Their presence in plasma samples may interfere with angiotensin assays in some circumstances.\n",
      "The transmission of impulses in the ectodermal slow conduction system of the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica (Couch). 1. The SS 1 fatigues in response to repetitive electrical stimulation. This fatigue is manifested by an increased conduction delay and a decreased SS 1 pulse amplitude. 2. Continued repetitive stimulation leads to the failure of the system. Recovery may take many seconds. Narrow strips of column fail more rapidly than wide strips. 3. The increased conduction delay is explained in terms of a decrease in the population of spiking cells. 4. A computer model is described and analysed. It suggests that conduction between electrically coupled ectoderm cells could be the basis for the SS1. The SS 1 may have properties not so far experimentally demonstrated; for example, under certain conditions it could behave as a local system.\n",
      "Colonial conduction systems in the Anthozoa: Octocorallia. 1. The octocorals Alcyonium digitatum, Pennatula phosphorea and Virgularia mirabilis each have a through-conducting nerve net. The nerve net demonstrated electrophysiologically may well be the same as that previously shown by the use of histological techniques. 2. It exhibits both facilitation and defacilitation in the rate of conduction of pulses. 3. The distance of spread of nerve net activity is not limited by the number of stimuli applied. 4. The nerve net controls fast muscle contractions; the frequency of pulses is important in determining which muscles contract and in which sequence. 5. The nerve net is 'spontaneously' active. 6. A previously undescirbed slow system has been identified in Pennatula. It has many of the properties of slow systems in sea anemones and may well be ectodermal. It is suggested that multiple conduction systems are of common occurrence in the Anthozoa.\n",
      "Water regulation by a presumptive hormone contained in identified neurosecretory cell R15 of Aplysia. Injection of an homogenate of identified neuron R15 into the hemocele of Aplysia produced a weight increase of 3-10% within 90 min. Control injections of several other identified neurons or of seawater, were ineffective. The weight increase occurred even when the animals were maintained in 5% hyperosmotic seawater. The activity of the R15 homogenate was retained after acidification to pH 2 and heating to 100 degrees C; but activity was destroyed by proteolytic digestion with Pronase. Dialysis in cellulose dialysis tubing resulted in a significant loss of aion on Sephadex G-50 (nominal exclusion limits 1,500-30,000 daltons), activity was present in the partially included volumes, but was absent in the totally excluded or totally included volumes. The data support the notion that R15 contains one or more hormones involved in ionic regulation or water balance. The results of bioassays of R15 extracts subjected to different treatments are consistent with the hypothesis that activity is due to one or more stable polypeptides of relatively low molecular weight.\n",
      "Intracellular pH transients in squid giant axons caused by CO2, NH3, and metabolic inhibitors. The intracellular pH (pHi) of squid giant axons has been measured using glass pH microelectrodes. Resting pHi in artificial seawater (ASW) (pH 7.6-7.8) at 23 degrees C was 7.32 +/- 0.02 (7.28 if corrected for liquid junction potential). Exposure of the axon to 5% CO2 at constant external pH caused a sharp decrease in pHi, while the subsequent removal of the gas caused pHi to overshoot its initial value. If the exposure to CO2 was prolonged, two additional effects were noted: (a) during the exposure, the rapid initial fall in pHi was followed by a slow rise, and (b) after the exposure, the overshoot was greatly exaggerated. Application of external NH4Cl caused pHi to rise sharply; return to normal ASW caused pHi to return to a value below its initial one. If the exposure to NH4Cl was prolonged, two additional effects were noted: (a) during the exposure, the rapid initial rise in pHi was followed by a slow fall, and (b) after the exposure, the undershoot was greatly exaggerated. Exposure to several weak acid metabolic inhibitors caused a fall in pHi whose reversibility depended upon length of exposure. Inverting the electrochemical gradient for H+ with 100 mM K-ASW had no effect on pHi changes resulting from short-term exposure to azide. A mathematical model explains the pHi changes caused by NH4Cl on the basis of passive movements of both NH3 and NH4+. The simultaneous passive movements of CO2 and HCO3-cannot explain the results of the CO2 experiments; these data require the postulation of an active proton extrusion and/or sequestration mechanism.\n",
      "Analysis of an L-histidinol-utilizing mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Transductional analysis was applied to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant PAO14 (hnc-1). This mutant can utilize L-histidinol as sole source of carbon and nitrogen and has a 60-fold increased histidinol dehydrogenase (HDH) content (Dhawale, Creaser &amp; Loper, 1972). Transductional analysis was carried out using 18 histidine-requiring mutants to see where the hnc-1 locus maps in relation to the structural genes of histidine biosynthesis. The hnc-1 marker cotransduced with group IV genes at 97 to 100 % and not at all with group I, which is known to be the structural gene for HDH. The data obtained in the studies of Km (histidinol) and Km (NAD), and the effect of pH and temperature on the HDH activity from PAO1 and PAO14 are in full agreement with the genetic data that the hnc-1 mutation is not in the structural gene for HDH. It is suggested that hnc-1 may be a mutation in a regulatory gene affecting HDH synthesis in PAO14 and may map close to his-IV whose function in histidine biosynthesis is not known.\n",
      "Studies on the rumen flagellate Neocallimastix frontalis. The vast increase in the population density of the rumen flagellate Neocallimastix frontalis shortly after the host animal has commenced eating is caused by stimulation of a reproductive body on a vegetative phase of the organism to differentiate and liberate the flagellates. The stimulant is a component of the host's diet. The vegetative stage of N. frontalis bears a strong morphological resemblance to that of certain species of aquatic phycomycete fungi, and consists of a reproductive body borne on  a single, much branched rhizoid. The flagellates liberated in vivo within 15 to 45 min of feeding lose their motility within I h and develop into the vegetative phase, thus producing a rapid decrease in population density of the flagellates. Conditions for maximum flagellate production are similar to those occurring in the rumen: pH 6-5, 39 degrees C, absence of O2, presence of CO2. Differentiation of the reproductive body is inhibited by compounds affecting membrane structure and function, but not by inhibitors of protein synthesis. The organism was cultured in vitro in an undefined medium in the absence of bacteria or other flagellates.\n",
      "Properties of some bacteriocins produced by Rhizobium trifolii. Bacteriocins produced by six strains of Rhizobium trifolii were found to be of the relatively low molecular weight, non-phage type. The molecular weights ranged from approximately 1-8 X 105 to 2-0 X 105. All were of protein composition, as indicated by buoyant density (1-32 to 1-34 g/cm3) in CsC1 and by sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes. They were resistant to RNAase but sensitive to DNAase. The six bacteriocins could further be separated into two subgroups on the basis of sensitivity to extremes of pH, binding to filter membranes, activity spectrum on sensitive strains of R. trifolii, and possibly mode of action on sensitive bacteria. Bacteriocin production occurred spontaneously during the early-to mid-exponential phase of bacterial growth in broth culture.\n",
      "Production and purification of the gamma haemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus 'Smith 5R'. The gamma haemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus 'Smith 5R' was produced on Dolman-Wilson agar overlain with cellophane. Maximal yields of crude lysin with titres of 2000 to 4000 haemolytic units/ml were obtained within 24 h at 37 degrees C in 10% (v/v) CO2 in air, on medium adjusted to pH 7-0. The crude lysin was purified 2700-fold (with 75% recovery) by ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ammonium sulphate fractionation. The specific activity of the lysin was 10(5) haemolytic units/mg protein after the dialysed active precipitate was extracted with NaCl and reprecipitated with ammonium sulphate. Purified gamma lysin was homogeneous by disc electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis.\n",
      "Basic and neutral amino acid transport in Aspergillus nidulans. Arginine and methionine transport by Aspergillus nidulans mycelium was investigated. A single uptake system is responsible for the transport of arginine, lysine and ornithine. Transport is energy-dependent and specific for these basic amino acids. The Km value for arginine is 1 X 10(-5) M, and Vmax is 2-8 nmol/mg dry wt/min; Km for lysine is 8 X 10(-6) M; Kt for lysine as inhibitor of arginine uptake is 12 muM, and Ki for ornithine is mM. On minimal medium, methionine is transported with a Km of 0-I mM and Vmax about I nmol/mg dry wt/min; transport is inhibited by azide. Neutral amnio acids such as serine, phenylalanine and leucine are probably transported by the same system, as indicated by their inhibition of methionine uptake and the existence of a mutant specifically impaired in their transport. The recessive mutant nap3, unable to transport neutral amino acids, was isolated as resistant to selenomethionine and p-fluorophenylanine. This mutant has unchanged transport of methionine by general and specific sulphur-regulated permeases.\n",
      "Polyamino acid induced aphid transmission of plant viruses. Aphids transmitted poly-L-ornithine (PLO)-treated tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) when given acquistion and inoculation access periods as brief as 30 s and 2 min, respectively; the ability to transmit was lost within 90 min. Aphids without claws were able to transmit the virus. Transmission thus seems similar to that of nonpersistent viruses. The ratio of virus to polyamino acid, as well as the KCl concentration, markedly affected transmission. Transmission was best from mixtures which contained 250 mug/ml TMV, 2-5 MUG/ML PLO (mol. wt. 120000) and 0-6 M-KCl. A similar mixture favoured transmission when poly-L-lysine (mol. wt. 85000) was substituted for PLO, but with poly-L-lysine (mol. wt. 30 000) it was necessary to decrease the KCl to 0-3 M to obtain transmission. Less KCl (0-08 to 0-24 M) also favoured aphid transmission of PLO-treated potato virus X and tobacco rattle virus. PLO-treated TMV ultracentrifuged in the presence of, and resuspended in, 0-6 M-KCl remained aphid  transmissible while PLO-treated virus in 2 M-DCl, which favours greater dissociation of the virus-PLO complex, was transmissible neither before nor after sedimentation by ultracentrifuging, and resuspension in 0-6 M-KCl. these results show that transmissibility is not due to a permanent alteration of the virus by PLO and indicate that the formation of a TMV-PLO complex is required for transmission. Sequential acquisition experiments suggest that PLO may act by binding TMV to receptor sites in aphids. However, the possibility that PLO affects the infection process was not ruled out.\n",
      "Disruption of Vi bacteriophage III and localization of its deacetylase activity. It has been shown that particles of Vi bacteriophage III catalyse deacetylation of O-acetyl pectic (polygalacturonic) acid, a structural analogue of Vi polysaccharide (Vi antigen). Using this substrate, and determining the acetic acid liberated by gas-liquid chromatogrphy, a method for the estimation of Vi phage deacetylase activity has been developed. Purified particles of Vi phage III were exposed to a variety of mildly dissociative reagents and conditions, and then tested for plaque-forming and for deacetylase activity. They have also been inspected under the electron microscope. Osmotic shock, and incubation in the presence of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (greater than or equil 0-01 M), or of L-arginine (0-25 M), were found to cause disintegration of the virions into empty head capsids, deoxyribonucleic acid, and base plates still carrying the spikes. The mixtures of viral fragments exhibited an increased deacetylase activity. Using zonal sedimentation and ion exchange chromatography, the phage fragments obtained by treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid have been fractionated and the base plates isolated. Amongst the viral components, these structures showed the highest specific deacetylase activity. They had the shape of six-pointed stars (about 9-5 nm inner, and 14-5 nm outer diam.) with a central hole or plug (approximately 3 nm), carrying six spikes, roughly cylindrical organelles of approx. 11 X 4 nm, one at each of the points. Of the polypeptides of six sizes (P.1, about 153,000 daltons; P.2, 91,000; P.3, 71,000; P.4 56,500; P.6, 22,000), detected in whole Vi phage III virions by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, only two, P.2 and P.3 were found in the base plates.\n",
      "A model to replace psychiatric hospitals. A comprehensive system of community treatment in southwest Denver has reduced the need for adult psychiatric inpatient beds to less than 1/100,000 population. Six small, community-based therapeutic environments, crisis intervention, home treatment, social systems intervention, and rapid tranquilization comprise the essential components of this total community care system. The system operates within a framework of citizen participation and community control, the elimination of formal staff offices, and a focus on working in the real-life setting of the client and his family. To evaluate the effectiveness of community care, patients about to be hospitalized were randomly assigned to a psychiatric hospital or to community alternative treatment. Outcome measures at discharge and at follow-up completed by the client himself, treatment staff, and family members indicate that community treatment was more effective than psychiatric hospitalization.\n",
      "Dynamic changes in regional CBF, intraventricular pressure, CSF pH and lactate levels during the acute phase of head injury. The authors measured regional cerebral 133xenon (133Xe) blood flow (rCBF), intraventricular pressure (IVP), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pH and lactate, systemic arterial blood pressure (SAP), and arterial blood gases during the acute phase in 23 comatose patients with severe head injuries. The IVP was kept below 45 mm Hg. The rCBF was measured repeatedly, and the response to induced hypertension and hyperventilation was tested. Most patients had reduced rCBF. No correlation was found between average CBF and clinical condition, and neither global nor regional ischemia contributed significantly to the reduced brain function. No correlation was found between CBF and IVP or CBF and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The CSF lactate was elevated significantly in patients with brain-stem lesions, but not in patients with \"pure\" cortical lesiosn. The 133Xe clearance curves from areas of severe cortical lesions had very fast initial components called tissue peaks. The tissue peak areas correlated with areas of early veins in the angiograms, indicating a state of relative hyperemia, referred to as tissue-peak hyperemia. Tissue-peak hyperemia was found in all patients with cortical laceration or severe contusion but not in patients with brain-stem lesions without such cortical lesions. The peaks increased in number during clinical deterioration and disappeared during improvement. They could be provoked by induced hypertension and disappeared during hyperventilation. The changes in the tissue-peak areas appeared to be related to the clinical course of the cortical lesion.\n",

Deans of Nursing who choose to be administrators of the Health Sciences may very well enhance Nursing programs by facilitating the nursing faculty to become leaders through offering service courses in Health, may thereby help to cut the high cost of nursing education, and may make a contribution to other Health majors by sharing their faculty's special expertise in Health theory.\n",
      "Studies of the effect of dietary cholesterol on hepatic protein synthesis, reduced glutathione levels and serine dehydratase activity in the rat. A basal diet or a basal diet plus 1% of cholesterol and 0.33% cholic acid was fed to rats for varying lengths of time and (1) the activities of liver phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase (PEP-CK), tyrosine transaminase (TT), and serine dehydratase (SD); (2) the rate of total hepatic protein synthesis and (3) the concentration of hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) were quantitated. The specific activity of PEP-CK was significantly depressed by cholesterol plus cholic acid feeding, while the specific activity of TT was unchanged. No significant effect of dietary cholesterol plus cholic acid was found on the total liver activities. In contrast, SD specific activity was increased 3-fold. The rate of (U-14C)-L-leucine incorporation into total TCA precipitable protein following ingestion of cholesterol plus acid was significantly reduced when the data were expressed as dpm (U-14C)-L-leucine/mg protein. After correcting this expression for specific radioactivity of the liver tissue free leucine pool, no significant effect of dietary cholesterol plus cholic acid on hepatic protein synthesis existed. In fact, the amount of 14C-leucine incorporated into protein on a total liver basis was 50% greater for the cholesterol group. On a per gram of liver basis, the concentration of GSH in the liver of rats fed a cholesterol plus cholic acid diet was significantly decreased. Considering the liver enlargement in rats fed cholesterol plus cholic acid, total organ GSH was found to be significantly greater than for rats fed a basal diet.\n",
      "Thiamine triphosphatase activity of myosin and accelerating effect of thiamine di- and tri-phosphates on superprecipitation of actomyosin. TTP accelerated ATP-induced superprecipitation of actomyosin in as low a concentration as 30 muM and decreased light scattering by actomyosin. These effects could also be observed in the same way, but to a lesser degree, by addition to TDP. Myosin was able to hydrolyze TTP to TDP, but some important differences were confirmed between myosin TTPase and ATPase. Myosin TTPase was inhibited by actin and showed a much larger Km than that of ATPase. TTP significantly inhibited myosin B ATPase and ATP greatly inhibited myosin B TTPase. These findings suggest that the accelerating effect of TDP and TTP may be due to the binding of thiamine phosphate to the regulatory site of myosin followed by a change in its physical chemical property, rather than due to the competitive binding of thiamine phosphate to the catalytically activity site of myosin.\n",
      "The meaning of the Leydig cell in relation to the etiology of cryptorchidism: An experimental electron-microscopic study. In our electron-microscopic studies of testicular biopsies, both normal and cryptorchid, we found a simple atrophy of the Leydig cell in the cryptorchid testis. Based on experiments by Raynaud1,2 and Jean3 on pregnant mice, we tried to find the reason for changes in the Leydig cell relating to the etiology of cryptorchidism. We found on electron microscopic study of testes in the offspring of pregnant mice treated with estrogen the same atrophy of the Leydig cell as we see in human cryptorchidism. These changes are not evident when estrogen and HCG are given together. We can conclude from this experiment that lack of gonadotropin stimulation leads to the atrophy of Leydig cells. This atrophy then produces a lack of androgen which could be responsible for cryptorchidism.\n",
      "The in vitro adsorption of drugs from horse serum onto carbon coated with an acrylic hydrogel. In vitro studies have shown that uncoated carbon and carbon coated with an acrylic hydrogel are capable of adsorbing drugs from horse serum at 37 degrees. Increase in the coating weight from 2 to 4% decreased the rate of adsorption but not the total capacity. In vivo data supports the concept of carbon haemoperfusion for use in the treatment of drug overdose.\n",
      "The interaction of antihistamines with lecithin monolayers. The interaction of a series of antihistamines with monolayers of L-alpha-dipalmitoyl lecithin has been examined. An increase in the monolayer surface pressure was noted for monolayers spread on the antihistamine solutions, suggesting penetration of the film by drug molecules. At high surface pressures there was an apparent ejection of drug molecules from the film. The ability of the antihistamines to increase surface pressure was correlated with their surface activity at the air-solution interface. The effect of drug concentration on the magnitude of the surface pressure was examined for diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Application of the Gibbs adsorption equation at low surface compressions indicated an approximate area per molecule for diphenhydramine in the film which was in good agreement with the value previously obtained at the air-solution interface. Preliminary measurements showed that the surface pressure increase was larger in the presence of phosphate buffer at pH 6-8. It was not clear whether this effect was caused by the buffer components or was a pH effect.\n",
      "Effect of surfactant monomers on chloramphenicol association to an albumin-lecithin complex: a model for modified drug absorption. The binding of chloramphenicol to an albumin-lecithin complex in the presence or absence of premicellar concentrations of both ionic and non-ionic surfactants has been examined. Long chain, strong ionic detergents, such as sodium dodecyl sulphate or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, severely perturb protein structure and eventually allow full separation of the complex into lecithin and albumin-detergent complexes. The dissociation process is reversible upon the removal of the detergent by exhaustive dialysis. After the splitting of the complex, the amount of antibiotic associated with the lipid-protein mixture increases. Structural alteration of the albumin-lecithin complex and the increase in the binding of chloramphenicol have an effect on the transfer rate of this antibiotic across an artificial barrier consisting of an aqueous dispersion of the same complex, as observed in a model system. It is suggested that a reversible alteration in membrane structure, and consequently in membrane permeability, might be easily effected, at the molecular level, through a reversible dissociation of structural lipoproteins into their components, operated by premicellar concentrations of ionic surfactants. This represents a tentative picture of the possible events taking place within the membrane and modifying the absorption rate of a drug, when it is associated with surfactants in a pharmaceutical preparation.\n",
      "The effect of blending on the rheological properties of gelatin solutions and gels. The effect of blending on rheological properties for an acid and alkaline processed gelatin has been investigated. Blending of weak gels (1-0-3-5% w/v at 25 degrees), resulted in a decrease in gel rigidity whereas in the stronger gels (5-50% w/v at 25 degrees) and solutions (18% and 30% w/v at 35 degrees), an increase occurred. The decrease in structure in the weak gels is considered to be due to coulombic effects, minimum strength occurring for a mixture which possessed zero charge in solution. A tentative explanation for effects in rigid gels and concentrated solutions is offered.\n",
      "Amphetamine tachyphylaxis in the pithed guinea-pig. A single dose of (+)-amphetamine (8 mg kg-1, i.p.) administered 4 h before experimentation, reduced the pressor and positive chronotropic effects elicited by this drug (0-6 mg kg-1, i.v.) and augmented the rate of the development of tachyphylaxis to these responses in the pithed guinea-pig preparation. Amphetamine pretreatment reduced the pressor and positive chronotropic effects of phenylephrine (0-1 mg kg-1, i.v.) and the positive chronotropic effects of angiotensin (30 mug kg-1, i.v.). The rate of the development of tachyphylaxis to the cardiovascular responses elicited by phenylephrine and angiotensin was augmented by amphetamine pretreatment. The results suggest that an indirect mechanism (noradrenaline) may in part mediate the cardiovascular effects of these 3 drugs and/or that amphetamine may act as a competitive antagonist at adrenoceptor sites.\n",
      "Phenylbutazone-warfarin interaction in the dog. The administration of phenylbutazone together with warfarin to dogs resulted in an elevation of the free fraction of warfarin in the plasma from 2-6 to 8-0% thus providing direct support for the notion that phenylbutazone induced inhibition of warfarin binding to plasma proteins. This inhibition as evaluated by a kinetic method was accompanied by a two-fold decrease in the plasma half-life of warfarin from 18-4 h in control animals to 9-6 h in phenylbutazone-treated animals. Marked increases in warfarin-induced hypoprothrombinaemia were observed when at doses up to 8 mg kg-1 (orally) it was given with phenylbutazone (50 mg kg-1, orally). The unbound fraction of warfarin in canine plasma ranged from 1-7 to 4-3% indicating individual differences in the extent of the plasma binding of warfarin in the dog.\n",
      "The effect of pancuronium on myocardial contraction and catecholamine metabolism. The effects of pancuronium bromide infusion on the uptake and release of [14C] noradrenaline (14C-NA) by the isolated, perfused rat heart and on the chronotropic and inotropic activity of the isolated heart were evaluated. Hearts were removed from animals under light ether anaesthesia, transferred to a modified Langendorff perfusing apparatus and perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution at a rate of 5 ml min-1. The effect of pancuronium on the uptake of noradrenaline was determined by perfusing hearts for 5 min with perfusate containing various concentrations of pancuronium and 200 ng ml-1 of 14C-NA. After 5 min pancuronium-treated hearts contained less 14C-NA. The degree of reduced uptake increased with increasing concentrations of pancuronium. In addition, the combination of pancuronium perfusion and electrical stimulation (15 mA for 10 ms at 4 Hz) blocked the 50 min uptake of 14C-NA by the heart to a greater degree than either factor separately. The release of noradrenaline was determined after perfusing hearts with 14C-NA followed by perfusion with solution containing pancuronium but no 14C-NA for 1 h. Pancuronium infusion did not significantly alter the release of 14C-NA from the heart after 1 h of perfusion. The infusion of pancuronium caused a reduction in both the rate and strength of myocardial contraction of the isolated heart which was reversed by perfusion with perfusate free of pancuronium. Following perfusion with pancurnium the rate and strength of contraction of the heart was seen to \"rebound\" above pre-pancuronium values for a short period. The rebound of myocardial rate and contraction may have been due to the presence of myocardial noradrenaline previously blocked from reuptake by pancuronium since hearts removed from reserpinized animals did not demonstrate \"rebound.\"\n",
      "Metabolism of delta1-tetrahydrocannabinol by the isolated perfused dog lung. Comparison with in vitro liver metabolism. The metabolism of (-)-delta1-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta1-THC) has been studied in the isolated perfused dog lung. After intravascular administration of [3H]-delta1-THC there was an overall biotransformation of 12%. Two major metabolites were isolated and identified as 3'-hydroxy-delta1-THC and 4'-hydroxy-delta1-THC. 7-Hydroxy-delta1-THC was also present together with small amounts of 6alpha-hydroxy-delta1-THC and 6beta-hydroxy-delta1-THC. An in vitro experiment using a dog liver microsomal preparation was also carried out and showed that the major metabolites were 6beta-hydroxy-delta1-THC and 6alpha-hydroxy-delta1-THC. 7-Hydroxy-delta1-THC and 1,2-epoxy-hexahydrocannabinol were also isolated together with small amounts of 3'-hydroxy-delta1-THC and 4'-hydroxy-delta1-THC. The side-chain hydroxylated compounds are hitherto undescribed metabolites of delta1-THC.\n",
      "Determination of low cencentrations of the quaternary ammonium compound thiazinamium methylsulphate in plasma and urine. A sensitive and selective method for the quantitative determination of the quaternary ammonium antiacetylcholine-compound thiazinamium methylsulphate (Multergan) in plasma and urine is described. The procedure is based on ion pair extraction of the compound with iodide as the counter ion. This is followed by gas chromatography using an alkali flame ionization detector. The detection limit is 2 ng ml-1 with a recovery of 88-0 +/- 6-2% from plasma, 91-4 +/- 4-6% from urine. The described method can also be applied to other quaternary ammonium compounds.\n",
      "Kinetics and mechanisms of drug action on microorganisms XXII: Effects of aminosidine with and without organism pretreatment with bacteriostatic agents. Escherichia coli generation in the logarithmic growth phase was inhibited in peptone broth USP at pH 7.0 without kill below 3.0 mug/ml of aminosidine. Above this value, the logarithms of the number of viables of the drug-treated culture ultimately decreased linearly with time and the slopes of these plots were independent of concentration. A concentration-dependent lag in the time of attainment of the cidal action was observed, and the extent of this lag was related to the ease of emergence of resistant organisms. The minimal concentration for cidal action increased with increasing concentrations of nutrients and with decreasing pH. Pretreatment of the cultures with novobiocin and tetracycline lessened the minimum bactericidal concentration of aminosidine whereas chloramphenicol pretreatment increased it. Tetracycline pretreatment inhibited the emergence of aminosidine-resistant organisms.\n",
      "Elementary osmotic pump. The elementary osmotic pump is a new delivery system for drugs or other active agents; it delivers the agent by an osmotic process at a controlled rate. Control resides in the: (a) water permeation characteristics of a semipermeable membrane surrounding the formulated agent, and (b) osmotic properties of the formulation. In its simplest embodiment, the system is constructed by coating an osmotically activie solid agent with the rate-controlling, semipermeable membrane. This membrane contains an orifice of critical size through which solubilized agent is dispensed. The system can contain the agent in solid form at loading higher than 90% of the total volume, and the agent can be delivered at rates several orders of magnitude higher than can be achieved by solution diffusion through polymeric membranes. The delivery rate, the fraction of total content delivered at zero order, and the system's delivery portal size have been calculated for delivery of a single compound. Experimental work verified the theory. The release rate from the system was found to be independent of outside agitation when the system is not deformed by shaking action, the pH of the environment, and delivery portal size for sizes within a specified range. The delivery rate from this system in vitro and in the GI tract of dogs was found to be equal.\n",
      "New and expedient determination of atenolol in biological samples. A method is described for the GLC determination of atenolol BP in plasma and urine. Extraction is accomplished under dehydrating conditions, and interfering impurities are removed by using an acidified cyclohexane-isopropanol mixture (2:1) and charcoal-treated paper disks. The drug thus isolated appears to react more efficiently with heptafluorobutyric anhydride, increasing the sensitivity of GLC electron-capture analysis. Concentrations as low as 0.02 mug/ml were measured using 0.5-ml aliquots of plasma or 0.1 ml of urine. Amino alcohols such as atenolol may form hydrates or alcoholates, precluding complete derivatization with heptafluorobutyric anhydride.\n",
      "Time course and dose dependence of antacid effect on urine pH. Daily administration of a proprietary magnesium and aluminum hydroxides suspension, 15 ml four times a day, to normal adult volunteers resulted in a statistically significant increase in urine pH on the 1st day of treatment. The urine pH's on the 2nd and subsequent days of treatment were statistically significantly higher than on the 1st day. A 7.5-ml dose of the antacid suspension, taken four times a day, had only a small and not statistically significant effect on urine pH, while 30 ml four times a day increased urine pH by approximately the same magnitude as the 15-ml doses. The effect of the antacid on urine pH persisted for at least 1 day after discontinuation of dosing.\n",
      "Quantitative analysis of tribromsalan in blood and urine. Tribromsalan can be quantitatively measured in whole blood and urine by a technique involving extraction with ethyl acetate, treatment with silica gel, separation by TLC, and quantitative measurement by fluorescent spectrophotometry. This method has a sensitivity down to 125 ng (25 ppb in 5.0 ml of sample) of free tribromsalan and shows an average 90% recovery of tribromsalan in blood and urine with standard deviations of 9.7 and 7.4%, respectively.\n",
      "pH-dependent secretion of procainamide into saliva. The relationship between serum and stimulated, mixed saliva concentrations of procainamide was determined in 12 chronically medicated patients. Samples were obtained at times chosen to approximate the maximum and minimum serum concentrations of the drug during a dosing interval. Marked intersubject variability was found in the ratio of saliva to serum concentration of the drug (0.27-8.93). There was no correlation between the dose (milligrams per kilogram per day) and the minimum serum or saliva concentration of procainamide. Saliva pH ranged from 6.3 to 8.0 in eight subjects. The ratio of saliva to serum concentration of procainamide increased with decreasing pH. This result can be largely explained by the pH-dependent ionization and distribution of procainamide, a weak base.\n",
      "Sympathetic cardiovascular effects of experimental strychnine poisoning in dogs. The cardiovascular effects of intravenously administered strychnine were studied in anesthetized and paralyzed dogs. Administration of strychnine in cumulative doses of up to 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg caused significant pressor, as well as positive inotropic and chronotropic, effects on the heart which were abolished by adrenergic blocking agents. The cardiovascular responses possibly were elicited by a central mechanism in contrast to the peripheral inhibitory action of strychnine on the sympathetic system. Diazepam caused a marked attenuation of the pressor response with only slight changes on the heart. A combination of diazepam and propranolol would appear to be a useful therapy in cases of strychnine poisoning showing marked cardiovascular excitation.\n",
      "Evaluation of the permanent sympathectomy produced by the administration of guanethidine to adult rats. The administration of guanethidine to adult rats has been shown by morphological criteria to destroy sympathetic neurons. The objective of this study was to evaluate by biochemical and functional criteria the degree and permanence of this sympathectomy. Young adult male rats (260-300 g) were injected with saline (controls) or with guanethidine for 5 weeks. The status of the sympathetic nervous system in the animals was evaluated 1, 3 and 6 to 7 months after cessation of treatment. Seven months after cessation of treatment; the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglia of treated animals was greatly reduced, as were the norepinephrine levels in peripheral tissues. The concentration of epinephrine and the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in adrenals were not different from controls at any of the times studied. Norepinephrine concentrations in several areas of the central nervous system were unchanged. Increases in blood pressure in response to stimulation of the sympathetic vasomotor outflow in the pithed rat preparation were markedly and permanently reduced in guanethidine-treated animals. Isolated intestinal nerve-muscle preparations from guanethidine-treated animals usually contracted in response to nerve stimulation, rather than relaxing as in controls. The response to stimulation of the hypogastric nerve in vas deferens preparations was reduced 1 month after cessation of treatment. The responses of the vas deferens from guanethidine-treated and control animals were the same 7 months after treatment despite a 93% reduction in norepinephrine concentration. The data demonstrate that the administration of guanethidine to adult rats produces a marked and permanent destruction of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system.\n",
      "Mechanism of action of quinidine on squid axon membranes. The mechanism of action of quinidine on squid axons has been examined by means of voltage clamp and internal perfusion techniques. When applied either externally or internally, quinidine HCl suppresses both sodium and potassium conductance increases, the effect on the former accounting for the observed decrease in action potential. The potassium conductance in quinidine undergoes a marked inactivation in a manner dependent upon the membrane potential and time, accounting for the observed prolongation of the terminal falling phase of the action potential. Quinidine methiodide exhibits the effect similar to that of quinidine HCl only when applied internally. The dissociation constants of quinidine in suppressing the sodium conducting system are estimated to be 2.4 x 10(-4) and 4.0 x 10(-4) M for quinidine HCl and methiodide, respectively. The dissociation constant of quinidine in suppressing the potassium-conducting system decreases with increasing step depolarization. When applied externally to the intact axons, quinidine HCl is more effective at external pH 8.6 than at 7.3. When perfused internally, quinidine HCl is more effective at internal pH 7.0 than at 8.0, and the potency is related to the calculated internal concentration of the charged form rather than that of the uncharged form. These results lead to the conclusion that quinidine HCl penetrates the nerve membrane in the uncharged form, is ionized in the axon and blocks the sodium and potassium conductances primarily in the charged form. Thus, quinidine and local anesthetics share some features in the terms of the site of action and active form.\n",
      "Barbiturates block calcium uptake by stimulated and potassium-depolarized rat sympathetic ganglia. The effects of two barbiturates on calcium uptake by sympathetic ganglia have been examined. Sodium pentobarbital (0.4-0.75 mM) and sodium thiopental (0.3 mM) block the preganglionic stimulation-induced uptake of 45Ca by rat superior cervical ganglia but not action potential conduction in the presynaptic axons. The ganglionic-blocking agent, tetraethylammonium, does not inhibit stimulation-induced Ca uptake and does not prevent the blocking effect of thiopental. This effect is therefore probably presynaptic. Postassium-rich media also stimulate Ca uptake by the ganglia, and this effect is markedly inhibited by pentobarbital. Since the K stimulation effect is also observed in deafferented ganglia but not in guanethidine-denervated ganglia, this effect is probably associated primarily with postsynaptic elements. In sum, the data suggest that the barbiturates inhibit Ca permeability changes in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons.\n",
      "Mechanism of action of pentagastrin and acetylcholine on the longitudinal muscle of the canine antrum. 1. Electrical and mechanical activities of the longtitudinal muscle of the dog antrum were recorded with the double sucrose-gap technique. 2. The muscle exhibited spontaneous action potentials which consisted of a spike-like potential which, after a brief and partial repolarization, was followed by a negative-going, plateau-type potential. In 97% of the preparations, no tension changes were produced by spontaneous action potentials. 3. Tetrodotoxin, atropine, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and H1 and H2 receptor blocking agents had no effect on the action potential. It was concluded that the action potential was myogenic in origin. 4. The mean frequency of the action potential at 37+/- 0.5 degrees C was 1.0/min+/-0.06 (s.e. of mean, n=92) and the mean duration 7.1+/-0.2 sec (s.e. of mean, n=11). 5. Steady depolarizing current increased whereas hyperpolarizing current decreased the frequency of the action potential. 6. Length-tension relations were studied. In twelve strips, the average resting, passive, tension at LO was 570 mg. The active force of isometric contraction produced by acetylcholine increased with strip length up to a maximum, then decreased wtih further increased in length. There were no mechanical responses to pentagastrin. 7. Pentagastrin had two sites of action. On smooth muscle, it increased the frequency of the action potential in a dose dependent fashion. Threshold concentraions ranged from 2X10-14 to 10-11M. The ED50 was 2X10-10M. The maximum response, 5.4/min, was reached at 10-8M. Pentagastrin also released acetylcholine from intramural cholinergic nerves. 8. Pentagastrin reduced the amplitude and duration of the action potential.\n",
      "An alkyl etherase in rat liver. 1. Diethyl ether, which is known to be partly metabolized in vivo, has been found to show an O2 uptake with the rat liver microsomal membranes; a similar reaction is given with other short chain aliphatic ethers, isoproply and n-butyl ether. 2. The \"etherase\" reaction is optimal at pH 7.2-7.4 and is not accompanied by an increased formation of malondialdehyde. 3. When CoA is added to the microsomes together with a source of oxaloacetate and the consensing enzyme synthase, the etherase present forms citrate from diethyl ether, indicating an acetylation of CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle. 4. Similarly to 3, fluorocitrate is formed from methyl fluoroethyl ether. 5. Differing from plasmalogens, a tetrahydropteridine does not have to be added as a co-factor.\n",
      "Micro-electrode measurement of the internal pH of crab muscle fibres. The internal pH of crab muscle fibres was measured using recessed-tip pH-sensitive micro-electrodes. Immediately following electrode penetration the mean internal pH was 7-21 +/- 0-02 (S.E. of mean) and the mean membrane potential was -64-9 +/- 0-6 mV (S.E. of mean). If H+ ions were passively distributed across the fibre membrane the internal pH would have been 6-39. 2. The internal pH tended to rise before stabilizing at a mean value of 7-27 +/- 0-02 (S.E. of mean). The difference between immediate and stabilized values is highly significant and suggests acid injury on electrode penetration. 3. Changing the membrane potential or external pH had only small, slow effects on internal pH. 4. External CO2 caused a large and rapid decrease in internal pH. With low concentrations of CO2, the effect was dependent on the initial pH as predicted by the Law of Mass Action. During a long exposure to 2-65% CO2 at pH 7-5, the internal pH returned slowly to its previous value, suggesting active transport of H+ (or OH- or HCO3-) ions across the fibre membrane. 5. The internal buffering power calculated from the response to 2-65% CO2 was 47-3 +/- 2-8 slykes (m-equiv H+/pH unit per l.) (S.E. of mean).\n",
      "[Adrenergic and cholinergic control of oxytocin release evoked by vaginal, vagal and mammary stimulation in lactating rats (author's transl)]. 1. The amounts of oxytocin released during Ferguson and vago-pituitary reflexes are estimated by measurements of intramammary pressure. For the milk-ejection reflex, the gain in weight of the young over a period of 30 minutes is taken as an indirect index of the release of oxytocin. 2. Antagonists of specific cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors were injected into the third ventricle in order to delineate the role of the mediators and receptors in the control of oxytocin release. 3. The results suggest that three reflexes have a specific chemical transmission since: a) The Ferguson reflex is inhibited by the drugs that only block alpha and beta adrenoceptors. b) The vago-pituitary reflex is inhibited by the drugs that block alpha and beta adrenoceptors and muscarinic cholinoceptors. c) The milk-ejection reflex is inhibited by the drugs that block alpha adrenoceptors and muscarinic and nicotinic cholinoceptors.\n",
      "Proteins in the luminal fluid from the bovine oviduct. Oviducal fluid was collected by cannulation from four cows and by irrigation from fifteen slaughtered cows. The proteins in the fluid were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 4-5 and pH 8-9, isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The macromolecular components found were mainly serum proteins but small amounts of other proteins were detected in oestrous and dioestrous samples by electrophoresis at pH 8-9 following fractionation of the fluid by gel filtration or affinity chromatography. Small amounts of cathodically migrating proteins were detected directly by electrophoresis at pH 4-5 in dioestrous samples but not in oestrous samples. Determination of glycosidase activities revealed that the levels at oestrus were similar to the levels detected in serum. At dioestrus, the activities of B-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase were elevated.\n",
      "Boar seminal zinc-precipitable protein and the haemagglutinin. About 30% of boar seminal plasma nitrogen is maximally precipitated at room temperature by 6 to 10 mM zinc in citrate solution at pH 8. A rise in the total nitrogen precipitated by 1 to 6 mM zinc is accompanied by a fall in the haemagglutinin titre of the supernatant fluid. At 6 mM zinc addition, 95% of the haemagglutinin is precipitated, but much of this is recoverable by re-solution of the zinc precipitate. Protein profile studies by gel-filtration chromatography of the zinc precipitate solution reveals a mixture of proteins, some of which are not by themselves zinc-precipitable.\n",
      "Effect of season on some characteristics of stallion semen. Season had a pronounced effect upon seminal pH and refractometer 'protein', total carbohydrate, dry weight, total N2 and lactic acid in seminal plasma of first and second ejaculates. In addition, total seminal volume, spermatozoa per ml and per ejaculate, non-protein sulphhydryl and glycerylphosphorylcholine of second ejaculates were also influenced. There was a season difference in the concentrations of lactic acid in spermatozoa from first and in total N2 from spermatozoa in second ejaculates. The effects of season on seminal plasma were greater than those on spermatozoa. Spermatozoa in first ejaculates were less affected by season than those in secons ejaculates. This differential effect on first and second ejaculates was generally true of all seminal characteristics.\n",
      "Influence of ejaculation frequency of stallions on characteristics of semen and output of spermatozoa. Approximately 1 week was required to stabilize the extragonadal sperm reserves in stallions ejaculated daily for 10 weeks. The true daily sperm output of a stallion was equal to the mean daily sperm output of seven ejaculates +/- 1-35 X 10(9) spermatozoa. Mean concentrations of spermatozoa/ml and number of spermatozoa/ejaculate were higher (P less than 0-01) for X1 and X3/week ejaculation frequencies than for a X6/week frequency. Sperm output/week was nearly identical for a X6/week frequency. Sperm output/week was nearly identical for the X3 and X6 frequencies and higher (P less than 0-01) than the X1 frequency. Increase of ejaculation frequency from one to two ejaculates/day twice weekly significantly (P less than 0-01) raised the output of spermatozoa/week. Gel-free semen volume, spermatozoa/ml, and number of spermatozoa/ejaculate were higher (P less than 0-01) in the first, than in the second, ejaculate. Collection of semen on alternate days would be a practical ejaculation frequency for inseminating mares. Two ejaculates collected twice a week would be a practical ejaculation frequency for long-term storage of stallion semen.\n",
      "Transfer of gases and metabolites in the equine placenta: a comparison with other species. Mares and fetuses with indwelling catheters in the umbilical and uterine vessels have been used to monitor transplacental blood gas tensions, pH, O2 affinities and the concentration of various metabolites in fetal and maternal blood during late gestation. Measurements of umbilical and uterine blood flows and arterio-venous differences enabled the uptake of O2 and glucose by the fetus and the uterus to be estimated. The present findings are compared with those from other species in comparable conditions.\n",
      "Androgens and oestrogens in normal and cryptorchid stallions. Total androgens, testosterone and total oestrogens were measured in twenty-one intact, nine unilaterally cryptorchid, three bilaterally cryptorchid stallions and four geldings. Total oestrogens were significantly higher (P less than 0-005) and total androgens significantly lower (P less than 0-05) in the bilateral cryptorchid compared to other groups. There was a significant (P less than 0-025) day and night variation in total androgen levels. Thyroidectomized and intact animals showed a marked decrease in total androgen as well as testosterone levels during the winter period thus showing an effect of season on androgenic function of the testis. Disappearance rate of total and androgens following castration was extremely rapid and levels were undectable within 12 hr. Sexual stimulation appeared to increase total androgen levels. Testosterone, androstenedione, dihydrotestosterone, androstandiols, and androstenediol were identified in spermatic vein blood. Dihydrotestosterone was measured in fluid from the cauda epididymidis.\n",
      "Prognostic factors in polyarteritis. The clinical course of 40 patients with polyarteritis was reviewed to determine prognostic factors and response to treatment. The first three months were the most critical to survival. Survivorship was 57 per cent at five years. Older age of onset, involvement of skeletal muscle and presence of peripheral neuropathy weighted against a satisfactory outcome. Cutaneous vasculitis was associated with a more benign course. Myocardial disease, central nervous system involvement, or hypertension were not invariably poor prognostic factors. Muscle biopsies, even in the absence of clinical involvement, were a useful diagnostic procedure, and renal angiograms were found to be a valuable alternative to renal biopsy. An unequivocal distinction on clinical and histopathologic criteria could not be made among polyarteritis nodosa, hypersentitivity angiitis, and allergic granulomatosis. Australia antigenemia occurred in six per cent of patients. Although evaluation of therapy was difficult, data from this study did not show a superiority of high vs. low dosage of corticosteroids in suppressing active disease.\n",
      "Importance of the aromatic ring in adrenergic amines. 2. Synthesis and adrenergic activity of some nonaromatic six- and eight-membered ring analogs of beta-phenylethanolamine. The synthesis of beta-phenylethanolamine analogs in which the phenyl ring is replaced by cyclohexyl, cyclohexen-4-yl, cyclooctyl, cyclooctenyl, cycloocta-1,3-dien-2-yl, cycloocta-1,5-dienyl, and cyclooctatetraenyl was accompanied by conversion of the corresponding aldehydes to the cyanohydrins followed by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride. A preparatively useful synthesis of 1-formylcyclooctatetraene is described utilizing the photocycloaddition of methyl propiolate to benzene followed by reduction to the alcohol and oxidation with MnO2. All compounds, as their hydrochloride salts, exhibited indirect adrenergic activity on the rat vas deferens. On the reserpinized rat vas deferens all compounds potentiated the effects of exogenous norepinephrine. The results are in agreement with the conclusion that the more saturated the ring moiety, the greater the affinity for the amine uptake site of the vas deferens and suggest that there is no important interaction between the drug and this uptake site that involves pi-complex formation.\n",

The syntheses of trans- and cis-1-benzyl-3-dimethylamino-6-phenylpiperidine (1 and 2) are described. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be inhibitors to histamine, acetylcholine, and barium chloride induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum. Compounds 1 and 2 do not exhibit appreciable stereoselectivity in their ability to inhibit smooth muscle contractions. The cis compound 2 is a more effective inhibitor of histamine N-methyltransferase than the trans isomer 1.\n",
      "Synthesis and adrenoreceptor blocking action of aziridinium ions derived from phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine. Crystalline perchlorate salts of aziridinium ions derived from phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine were prepared. Both aziridinium ions were tested on the rat vas deferens and found to possess alpha-adrenergic potencies which were nearly identical with those of the parent compounds. The hydrolysis rates of phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine aziridinium ions (2a,b) in physiological medium were found to be 6.0 4 x 10(-4) and 8.35 x 10(-4) sec-1, respectively. The rates of cyclization of the parent amines to 2a and 2b in aqueous medium were 1.9 x 10(-2) and 7.2 x 10(-3) sec-1, respectively. The potencies and kinetic profiles indicate that the aziridinium ion is the only active species in alpha-adrenergic blockade. Moreover, differences in potency between phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine appear to be exclusively to a difference in receptor affinity rather than to a difference in intrinsic alkylating ability.\n",
      "Prebiotic peptide-formation in the solid state. II. Reaction of glycine with adenosine 5'-triphosphate and P1,P2-diadenosine-pyrophosphate. When a solution containing gly-N-pa and imidazole is evaporated to dryness and then maintained at a temperature between 65 degrees C and 100 degrees C, high yields of AppA and obligoglycines are obtained. We believe that ImpA is formed first, and then activates the carboxyl group of glycine or gly-A-pA. If glycine, ATP or AppA, and imidazole are heated together in the solid state, ImpA is formed and ATP , or indirectly from imidazole and gly-N-pA. Next the carboxyl group or glycine is activated by the ImpA formed in situ. The subsequent reactions of activated glycine leads to the formation of oligoglycines and the 2' (3')-glycylester of pA. Under plausible prebiobic conditions, good yields of oligoglycines up to the octamer can be obtained from glycine, ATP and imidazole.\n",
      "Prebiotic peptide-formation in the solid state. III. Condensation reactions of glycine in solid state mixtures containing inorganic polyphosphates. The reactions of glycine with inorganic polyphosphates in the solid state have been studied. The formation of peptides up to the decamer occurs at moderate temperatures(r.t.-100 degrees C) in the presence of imidazole and magnesium chloride. If adenosine 5' -monophosphate is added to the reaction mixture, 2'(3') -o-glycyl adenosine 5'-monophosphate is also obtained. These reactions could have occurred on the primitive earth.\n",
      "The prebiotic synthesis of deoxthymidine oligonucleotides. II. Comparison of condensing agents. A reaction which oligomerizes nucleotides under possible prebiotic conditions has been characterized. Nucleoside monophosphate in the presence of cyanamide at acid pH condenses to form dithymideine pyrophosphate and phosphodiester bonded compounds. Imidazole compounds and activated precursors such as nucleoside triphosphate are not necessary for this ologomerization reaction which produces primarily cyclic ologonucleotides.\n",
      "Formation of nucleoside 5'-polyphosphates from nucleotides and trimetaphosphate. When solutions of nucleoside 5'-phosphates and trimetaphosphate are dried out at room temperature, nucleoside 5'-polyphosphates are formed. The Mg++ ion shows a superior catalytic function in this reaction when compared with other divalent metal ions. Starting with nucleoside 5'-phosphates, Mg++ and trimetaphosphate, the predominant products in the nucleoside 5'-polyphosphate series pnN are p4N, P7N and p10N. Nucleoside 5'-diphosphates yield p5N and p8N, nucleoside 5'-triphosphates give p6N and p9N. The prebiological relevance of these reactions is discussed.\n",
      "On the possible role of organic melanoidin polymers as matrices for prebiotic activity. One of the major diagenetic pathways of organic matter in recent sediments involves the condensation of cellular constituents, particularly amino acids and sugars, into insoluble melanoidin-type polymers. These polymers consist mainly of humic and fulvic acids and make up the major part of the organic carbon reservoir in recent sediments. We suggest that a similar set of reactions between abiotically formed amino acids and sugars, and more generally between aldehydes and amines, occurred on a large scale in the prebiotic hydrosphere. The rapid formation of this insoluble polymeric material would have removed the bulk of the dissolved organic carbon from the primitive oceans and would thus have prevented the formation of an \"organic soup\". Melanoidin polymers have several properties which make them attractive hypothetical precursors of contemporary oxidation-reduction coenzymes: 1. they contain heterocyclic nitrogen compounds similar to the nitrogenous bases; 2. they contain a high concentration of stable free radicals; and 3. they tend to concentrate those heavy metals which play prominent roles in contemporary enzymic redox processes. The prebiotic formation of similar polymers could, therefore, have provided the starting point for a basic class of biochemical reactions. We suggest that the prebiotic scenario involved chemical and protoenzymic reactions at the sediment-ocean interface in relatively shallow waters and under conditions not much different from those of the recent environment.\n",
      "Hemoglobin function in the vertebrates: an evolutionary model. Comparative data on quaternary structure, cooperativity, Bohr effect and regulation by organic phosphates are reviewed for vertebrate hemoglobins. A phylogeny of hemoglobin function in the vertebrates is deduced. It is proposed that from the monomeric hemoglobin of the common ancestor of vertebrates, a deoxy dimer, as seen in the lamprey, could have originated with a single amino acid substitution. The deoxy dimer has a Bohr effect, cooperativity and a reduced oxygen affinity compared to the monomer. One, or two, additional amino acid substitutions could have resulted in the origin of a tetrameric deoxy hemoglobin which dissociated to dimers on oxygenation. Gene duplication, giving incipient alpha and beta genes, probably preceded the origin of a tetrameric oxyhemoglobin. The origin of an organic phosphate binding site on the tetrameric hemoglobin of an early fish required only one, or two, amino acid substitutions. ATP was the first organic phosphate regulator of hemoglobin function. The binding of ATP by hemoglobin may have caused the original elevation in the concentration of ATP in the red blood cells by relieving end product inhibition of ATP synthesis. The switch from regulation of hemoglobin function by ATP to regulation by DPG may have been a consequence of the curtailment of oxidative phosphorylation in the red blood cell. The basic mechanisms by which ATP and DPG concentrations can respond to strss on the oxygen transport system were present before the origin of an organic phosphate binding site on hemoglobin. A switch from ATP regulation to IP5 regulation occurred in the common ancestor of birds.\n",
      "Aminoacyl transfer from an adenylate anhydride to polyribonucleotides. Imidazole catalysis of phenylalanyl transfer from phenylalanine adenylate anhydride to the hydroxyl groups of homopolyribonucleotides was investigated as a chemical model of the biochemical aminoacylation of tRNA. Imidazole catalyzed transfer of phenylalanine to poly(U) increases from pH 6.5 to 7.7 and decreases above pH 7.7. At pH 7.7 approximately 10% of the phenylalanyl residues are transferred to poly(U). At pH 7.1, transfer to poly(U) was five times as great as to poly(A) and transfer to a poly(A) poly(U) double helix was negligible. At pH 7.1 approximately 45 mole percent linkages to poly(U) were monomeric phenylalanine; the remainder of the linkages were peptides of phenylalanine. The number of linkages and their lability to base and neutral hydroxylamine indicates that phenylalanine and its peptides are attached as esters to the 2' hydroxyl groups throughout poly(U) and the 2' (3') hydroxyl groups at the terminus of poly(U). These results do model the contemporary process of aminoacyl transfer to tRNA and continue to suggest that a histidine residue is in the active site of aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases.\n",
      "Hybrid-versus-parental strain reaction. I. Comparative mortality in allogenetic and parental strain male and female mice. Lethally irradiated male and female hybrids, parental strains, and the third party strain A mice were inoculated with reciprocal hybrid marrow from donors of the same sex. A graft-versus-host reaction was produced against H-Y antigens of reciprocal hybrids. Although the late mortality in inbred strain males was generally greater than that of females, without further tests this difference was not automatically attributable to an X or a Y chromosome disparity. Hybrids did not recognize the qualitative difference in antigenicity of their reciprocals, but they were able to recognize the quantitatively greater antigenicity of their parental strains, and a hybrid-versus-parental strain reaction occurred. The graft-versus-host reaction in the third party strain A mice was significantly more severe than that produced by hybrid marrow in their reciprocal hybrid recipients, but significantly less severe than that produced in the parental strains. The relationship between antigenicity and responsiveness was such that the severity of the graft-versus-host reactions masked the maternal influences observed with other reciprocal hybrids.\n",
      "Graft versus leukemia. VI. Adoptive immunotherapy in combination with chemoradiotherapy for spontaneous leukemia-lymphoma in AKR mice. A three-step treatment plan incorporating adoptive immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy was used to treat AKR (H-2k) mice bearing spontaneous leukemia-lymphoma (SLL). 1) Leukemic mice were treated with chemoradiotherapy for immunosuppression and leukemia cytoreduction. 2) To introduce a graft-versus-leukemia reaction against residual malignant cells, the immunosuppressed AKR mice were given immunocompetent cells from H-2 mismatched DBA/2 (H-2d) donors. 3) To \"rescue\" the AKR hosts from incipient graft-versus-host disease, the mismatched DBA/2 cells were killed with combination chemotherapy, and cells from allogeneic H-2 matched RF (H-2k) donors were administered to restore hematopoiesis. Leukemic AKR mice thus treated had significant prolongation of their median survival time and a higher 60-day survival rate post treatment than did untreated controls, chemoradiotherapy controls, or control mice that received chemoradiotherapy plus cells from syngeneic donors. Therefore, adoptive immunotherapy may be useful as an adjunct to conventional therapy for treatment of SLL in AKR mice.\n",
      "A study of tobacco carcinogenesis. XIII. Tumor-promoting subfractions of the weakly acidic fraction. The weakly acidic fraction (WAF) of cigarette smoke particulate matter was fractioned by silica get chromatography. We assayed the various primary subfractions for potential tumor-promoting activity by measuring the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into mouse epidermal DNA as induced by these subfractions. Based on these results and on chemical composition, the primary subfractions, were then combined into four major subfractions and tested on initiated mouse skin for tumor-promoting activity by long-term application. Two of these subfractions (40% of WAF) were inactive, whereas the other two (18 and 35% of WAF) showed tumor-promoting activity. The two active portions were then further chromatographed and tested by the short-term bioassay. Some major components of the resulting active fractions included alkyl-2-cyclopenten-2-ol-1-ones, catechols, hydroquinone, fatty acids, and 3-hydroxypyridines. Among these components, catechol, hydroquinone, 3-hydroxypyridine, 6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine, linolenic acid, and linoleic acid were inactive as tumor promoters in the experimental animal. The activity of the alkyl-2-cyclopenten-2-ol-1-ones is unknown. Other components remain to be identified.\n",
      "Metabolic characteristics of cells infected with a herpesvirus of turkeys. Chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with the nononcogenic herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) displayed an increased rate of glucose uptake, a pronounced alteration of the pH of the medium, and an increased production of lactic acid when compared to mock-infected cultures. Objective estimates of cytopathology (quantifiable neutral red uptake and cell protein determination) showed that cell deterioration was a slow process in HVT-infected cells when compared to infection by herpes simplex virus. Experiments with irradiated host cells demonstrated that HVT required functional cell DNA for replication. The inactivation of the necessary host cell function displayed multihit kinetics. In agreement  with data on other herpesviruses, HVT damaged by UV light could be photoreactivated in chick cells. The results indicate that HVT shares biologic properties in common with other herpes and transforming viruses.\n",
      "Control of mercury pollution. When a 203Ng(NO3)2 solution was kept at 25 degrees C in glass or polypropylene containers, 50 and 80% of original radioactivity was adsorbed to the containers' walls after 1 and 4 days, respectively. However, no loss in radioactivity was observed if the solution was supplemented with HgCl as carrier (100 mug Hg2+/ml) and stored in either container for 13 days. When 203Hg2+ was dissolved in glucose basal salt broth with added carrier, levels of 203Hg2+ in solution (kept in glass) decreased to 80 and 70% of original after 1 and 5 days and decreased even more if stored in polypropylene (60 and 40% of original activity after 1 and 4 days, respectively). In the absence of carrier, decreases of 203Hg2+ activities in media stored in either container were more pronounced due to chemisorption (but) not diffusion. The following factors affecting the removal of mercurials from aqueous solution stored in glass were examined: type and concentration of adsorbent (fiber glass and rubber powder); pH; pretreatment of the rubber; and the form of mercury used. Rubber was equally effective in the adsorption of organic and inorganic mercury. The pH of the aqueous 203Hg2+ solution was not a critical factor in the rate of adsorption of mercury by the rubber. In addition, the effect of soaking the rubber in water for 18 hr did not show any statistical difference when compared with nontreated rubber. It can be concluded that rubber is a very effective adsorbent of mercury and, thus, can be used as a simple method for control of mercury pollution.\n",
      "Enzymic deacetylation of carcinogenic arylacetamides by tissue microsomes of the dog and other species. The relative ability of arylacetamide deacetylase enzyme systems of dog liver to carry out the deacetylation of the carcinogens, 4-acetylaminobiphenyl, 2-acetylaminofluorene, and 2-acetylaminaphthalene, was examined. The arylacetamides were incubated with unfortified dog liver microsomes, and enzyme activity (nmol arylamine/mg protein/hr) was estimated by colorimetric quantitation of the resulting arylamines. The dog liver enzyme system displayed characteristics similar to those described for the rodent liver enzyme system in that enzyme activity was greatest in liver tissue, was localized in the microsomal subcellular fraction, required no cofactors, and was inhibited by heat, sodium fluoride, and thiol reagents. In five replicate assays, the relative rates of deacetylation were about 10, 6, and 1 with 4-acetylaminobiphenyl (84.8 +/- 12.4), 2-acetylaminofluorene (52.5 +/- 5.1), and 2-acetylaminonaphthalene (8.8 +/- 3.3), respectively. As a canine urinary bladder carcinogen, 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is considered more potent than 2-acetylaminofluroene, while 2-acetylaminonaphthalene is devoid of detectable carcinogenic activity, despite the fact that 2-aminoaphthalene is a well-established canine urinary bladder carcinogen. Removal of the acetyl group may be a requirement for urinary bladder carcinogenesis; accordingly, the present studies demonstrate the appearance of a direct relationship between dog liver deacetylase enzyme specificity and urinary bladder susceptibility to these carcinogenic arylacetamides.\n",
      "Renal chromium accumulation and its relationship to chromium-induced nephrotoxicity. This report is an attempt to study the renal handling of chromium under in vitro conditions and to relate this to the actions of the ion in the production of nephrotoxicity. Renal slice techniques were employed in these studies and were used to examine the effects of chromium on various renal transport processes. In addition, the accumulation of chromium by the renal tissue has also been studied. Marked accumulation by renal cortical slices of the rat was observed when 51Cr-labeled chromate or dichromate was added to the bathing solution. Some metabolic inhibitors interfered with this uptake process; in addition, some substrates metabolized by renal tissue reduced the accumulation of 51Cr. The use of [51Cr] dichromate and [51Cr]-chromate, as well as alterations in the bathing solution pH, indicated that in the rat chromium can interfere with renal transport processes, but that the oxidation state of this metal is not important. On the other hand, in the rabbit a greater interference with 51Cr uptake was noted at lower bathing solution pHs. This is interpreted to mean that chromate is the effective inhibitor in this species.\n",
      "Sodium bicarbonate administration during cardiac arrest. Effect on arterial pH PCO2, and osmolality. Arterial pH, Pco2, and osmolality were determined serially during cardiac resuscitation in patients and in dogs, with and without administration of sodium bicarbonate. These studies demonstrate that (1) in the absence of preexisting acidosis, severe acidosis can be prevented by adequate ventilation alone; (2) sodium bicarbonate administration results in a significant rise in arterial Pco2, which parallels the rise in pH despite adequate ventilation; (3) during prolonged cardiac and resuscitation, there is a rise in arterial osmolality that is accentuated by sodium bicarbonate. These studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate should not be used during resuscitation (1) in the absence of effective hyperventilation or where carbon dioxide removal is inadequate despite adequate ventilation, (2) in repeated doses, without confirmation of substantial acidosis, or (3) when cardiac arrest has been of brief duration and preexisting acidosis is unlikely. These studies also point to the need for a reappraisal of other buffers that do not elevate the arterial Pco2.\n",
      "Sarcotubular anomalous rectification of frog sartorius muscle. The membrane site responsible for anomalous rectification was determined in frog sartorius muscle fibers. The total current-voltage relation of glycerol-treated fibers which represents mainly the properties of the sarcolemma was linear for membrane potentials between about -90 and -50 mV. Thus moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification in intact fibers represents a property of the sarcotubular system. The absence of slow hyperpolarization in glycerol-treated fibers was caused by the abolition of early conductance increase, and the sarcotubular system is responsible for the inward rectifier. Picrotoxin selectively inhibited both moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification and hyperpolarization-induced early conductance increase. This suggests that the same component in the sarcotubular system is responsible for these conductance changes. The inhibition with picrotoxin of moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification suggests the possibility that it is caused by an electrogenic effect rather than a decrease in K conductance. A sarcolemmal hyperpolarization-activated slow conductance increase was revealed.\n",
      "Properties of sarcolemmal delayed rectification in glycerol-treated fibers of frog sartorius muscle. Total current-voltage relations were analyzed on nine glycerol-treated surface fibers of frog sartorius muscles in tetrodotoxin-containing isotonic normal Ringer solution. The results indicate that delayed rectification occurs in the sarcolemma on large depolarization and that delayed rectification is only partially inactivated during 1 sec of depolarization and not converted into anomalous rectification. The time to peak, the time course of inactivation and the potassium activation potential determined in glycerol-treated fibers were comparable to those analyzed previously in intact fibers. The value of the conductance increase during delayed rectification in glycerol-treated fibers appeared to be smaller than that in intact fibers.\n",
      "Sarcolemmal slow conductance increase of frog sartorius fibers during hyperpolarization. The properties of the hyperpolarization-activated sarcolemmal slow conductance increase in frog sartorius muscle fibers have been investigated using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) and propionate Ringer solution. More than 1 sec was required for maximum activation of the sarcolemmal slwo conductance increase. It is suggested that, although the sarcolemmal slow conductance increase was affected by deterioration, the conductance increase is not a direct product of deterioration but it represents a property of the sarcolemma which is encountered in physiological range. The sarcolemmal conductance increase was rather insensitive to the change in pH of Ringer solution. It is inferred that the absence of bellying in newly penetrated intact fibers at neutral and alkaline pHs is caused mainly by the shunting effect of large parallel conductance. Apparent augmentation with EDTA of the sarcolemmal conductance increase infers that Ca ions affect the conductance increase. The conductance increase occurred also in the EDTA-containing Cl-deficient solution. The sarcolemmal slow conductance increase has been compared with the change in Cl conductance reported by Hutter and Warner, and Warner.\n",
      "Effects of antidepressant drugs on amygdaloid after-discharge in rats. Effects of antidepressant drugs on the amygdaloid after-discharge induced by stimulating the amygdala in rats implanted with chronic electrodes, were investigated in correlation with anti-muricidal effects as well as neurotoxicity. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline markedly depressed both after-discharge and muricide at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses. The effect of PF-257 was also the same as tricyclic antidepressants. On the other hand, methamphetamine and pipradrol blocked the muricide at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses without depressing the amygdaloid after-discharge. Major tranquilizers, chlorpromazine and clozapine depressed both after-discharge and muricide only at doses larger than those which impaired rotarod performance. Haloperidol, on the contrary, depressed the after-discharge without selectively blocking the muricide. Minor tranquilizers, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide did not block the muricide at doses smaller than neurotoxic doses, although they showed a marked depression of the after-discharge.\n",
      "Effects of several beta-blockers on blood pressure in the rat. Effects of practolol, alprenolol and pindolol on blood pressure in the rat were studied. Also effects of these three beta-blocking agents on blood pressure and heart rate in spinal rats during adrenaline infusion were studied and compared with those of propranolol. The beta-blocking agents produced a sustained pressor action in the rat, and in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline. The magnitude of the pressor action induced by the beta-blockers was in the following order: pindolol larger than or equal to propranolol larger than or equal to alprenolol greater than practolol. Minimum doses of these beta-blockers required to cause a pressor action in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline were in the following order; practolol greater than alprenolol larger than or equal to propranolol larger than or equal to pindolol. The magnitude of the pressor action produced by the same dose of these beta-blockers and minimum doses of these beta-blockers required to cause a pressor action in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline seemed to be roughly proportional to their beta-receptor blocking activities. It was concluded that the minimum doses of these beta-blockers required to cause a pressor action and the magnitude of the pressor action induced by the beta-blockers in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline could be used to compare their beta-blocking activities and that practolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, seems to block not only cardiac beta-receptor but to some extent also peripheral vascular beta-receptors.\n",
      "The clinical use of dopamine in the treatment of shock. Dopamine is a direct-acting catecholamine with a short half-life that has many advantages in treating visceral hypoperfusion states such as shock and refractory heart failure. Unlike other inotropic drugs, dopamine directly dilates the mesenteric, renal, and cerebral vessels and redirects blood flow to essential viscera. This dopaminergic effect is prominent with doses of 100-700 mug/min in adults and is attenuated by phenothiazines and haloperidol. At doses of 700-1400 mug/min, dopamine also has a significant beta-adrenergic, inotropic effect, increasing myocardial contractility. The inotropic effect is equivalent to that of isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, but tachycardia, tachyarrhythmias, and angina may be less frequent with dopamine. In doses greater than 1400 mug/min, dopamine is a vasoconstrictor with pressor effects usually equivalent to that of norepinephrine. Dopamine dilates pupils, does not dilate bronchi, and does not shunt blood from viscera to skeletal muscles as does isoproterenol. Because dopamine increases myocardial contractility, selectively redistributes perfusion to essential viscera and allows a pharmacologic titration of effect, it is a logical first-choice catecholamine for treatment of shock and refractory heart failure.\n",

      "[Nonachlasine--a new drug for treatment of ischemic heart disease]. Data on the pharmacology of a new antianginal drug--Nonachlasine--are presented. Nonachlasine was found to increase the blood flow intensively and for long periods of time, increasing the oxygen reserve of the myocardium, thus increasing the cardiac output and the contractile function of the heart. The prevailing action of Nonachlasine on the blood supply and the function of the myocardium seems to be the result of several mechanisms: decreasing resistance of the coronaries due to the activation of the beta2-adrenergic structures; influence upon the extravascular factors of the regulation of the coronary circulation (changes in the metabolism and cardiac activity due to the excitation of the beta-adrenergic structures). The mechanism of the positive effect of Nonachlasine upon the blood supply and function of the heart is connected with its action on the adrenergic processes. The drug accumulates noradrenaline in the myocardium and increases the activity of phosphorilase-a. This coincides in time with the increased blood supply and contractile capacity of the heart. The beta-adrenoblocking agents prevent these effects. It was postulated that the effect of Nonachlasine in the blood supply and the activity of the heart is connected with its ability to utilize the energy reserve of the myocardium by way of switching over to the anaerobic way.\n",

Cordaron was especially effective in patients with localized stenoses of the coronary arteries. Nonachlasine (an activator of the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors) proved effective in 10 of 13 patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease.\n",

      "Renal response to short-term hypocapnia in man. This study examines the renal response to moderate hyperventilation in healthy man. Eight men hyperventilated for 26 hr (PaCO2 approximately 30 to 32 mm Hg) in normoxia (barometric pressure, PB approximately 740 mm Hg) and hypobaric hypoxia (PB approximately530 mm Hg). Anaerobic samples of arterial blood and urine were studied at two-hour intervals. Plasma [HCO3-] fell with time during sustained hypocapnia and after 26 hr was reduced 2.5 mEq/liter, with plasma pH compensated approximately 60%. Statistically significant changes in renal H+ handling were observed within the initial 2 hr of hyperventilation and were evident over the first 12 hr. Over 26 hr, mean total HCO3-excretion in hypocapnia was 10.2 mEq above control and mean total acid excretion (UVTA + UVNH4+) was 17.5 mEq below control. An increased urinary excretion of cations, especially sodium, accompanied the decrease in acid excretion. Plasma lactic acid accumulation was negligible. We conclude that renal mechanisms contribute significantly and relatively quickly to plasma pH compensation during the early phase of adaptation to hypocapnia in man.\n",
      "[The influence of isoglaucon on the hydrodynamics and haemodynamics of the eye (author's transl)]. By animal experiments and clinically we could prove that isoglaucon instillation caused the decrease in IOP due to both increase in outflow and reduction of humor secretion; the IOP decrease and changes in hydrodynamics being manifested more markedly in the fellow-eye. As reoophthalmography demonstrated \"Isoglaucon\" produced lumen narrowing in the anterior portion of the uveal tract. \"Isoglaucon\" was prescribed to 20 patients having open-angle-glaucoma, Two hours after instillation the 23 decreased in 26 eyes (of 28) by 9.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg. When prescribed regularly \"Isoglaucon\" raised the outflow facility coefficient from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.20 +/-0.02. The secretion decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.15. Thus, IOP decrease after \"Isoglaucon\" is accounted for by both improved outflow and reduction of aqueous humor secretion. The \"isoglucon\" instillation produced a rather moderate decrease in the total arterial pressure, though no expected parallelism in arterial and intraocular pressure was marked.\n",

In none of the 54 eyes was the I.O.P. higher after administration of the drug. On the contrary, the I.O.P. was siginificantly or highly significantly reduced for more than 2 hours, probably because of the beta-receptor-blocking component of the preparation.\n",

Characteristics of the open fractures are the extended lesion of the soft parts and the piece-like fractures. The treatmend depends on the patient's general state, the extension of the lesion of the soft parts, the contamination and the infection of the wound, as well as on the localization and the type of the fracture. In the case of proper indication the osteosynthesis yields satisfactory results, but it is not always to be performed and its use to exposed to dangers. The conservative treatment assures good results, if the lesion of the soft parts is minimal, the reduction of the dislocation is easily accoplished and the bone ends are to be held together. On the other hand, the method is unsuitable, if extended lesion of the soft parts occurs, as well as in the treatment of multifragmental fractures.

If primary healing of the wound is obtained and also the other conditions are favourable, the treatment after 7-10 days is the same as after covered fractures: stable osteosynthesis is performed. On the other hand, if suppuration of the wound occurs, the opposing fixed fracutre bone ends assure favourable conditions for the successful surgical treatment of the fracture. A further advantage of the method is that it may be performed without special instruments and without greater surgical experience.

The preparation and use of Xenograft - applied in the author's department - is discussed.\n",
      "Mosquito-borne arboviruses in arctic america. Mosquito-borne arboviruses are prevalent throughout subarctic regions of Canada and Alaska, principally in the boreal forest extending between latitudes 53 and 66 degrees N, but they have been identified in tundra regions as far north as 70 degrees N. All mosquito-borne agents have been bunyaviruses, comprising principally the snowshoe hare subtype of California encephalitis (CE) virus, but also Northway virus. Mosquito vectors comprise several Aedes species and Culiseta inornata, all of which have supported replication of CE virus following incubation at 13 degrees C or lower temperatures. Isolation of virus from wild-caught larvae points towards transovarial transfer. Principal vertebrate reservoirs of infection are mammals, especially snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) and ground squirrels (Citellus undulatus). Where the boreal forest merges into prairie grassland around 53 degrees N, Culex tarsalis mosquitoes become prevalent, and an alphavirus, western equine encephalomyelitis, is detected more frequently than CE virus.\n",
      "The significance of mosquito longevity and blood-feeding behaviour in the dynamics of arbovirus infections. Mosquito longevity and blood-feeding behaviour are very important but neglected factors in the dynamics of arbovirus infections as changes in them affect transmission rates exponentially. Some mosquito species feed on a narrow range of vertebrates, some on a wide range, both influenced by host-availability and other environmental and behavioural factors. Only those which feed on maintenance hosts contribute to maintenance of the infection. Some species change their feeding pattern with season. The frequency of blood-feeding depends inter alia on environmental temperature. Longevity is perhaps most important: the majority of mosquitoes infected probably do not survive long enough to become infective; it is influenced by relative humidity, temperature and predation. Longevity, feeding frequency and the extrinsic incubation period are all temperature dependent and are therefore important rate determinants in seasonal epizootics or epidemics. Equally, their relative stability in the tropics contributes to the equilibrium of an enzootic or endemic.\n",
      "Properties of Semliki Forest virus nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid of the Semliki Forest virus is composed of 34% RNA and 66% protein, or one RNA and about 240 capsid protein molecules. The particle is spherical, with a diameter of 38--39 nm. If the nucleocapsid is exposed to slightly acid pH (6.4--5.6) it undergoes a structural change and is contracted to a 32 nm state. A similar contraction can be effected by RNase treatment, in this case, however, in connection with a loss of RNA. Treatment of the nucleocapsid with 0.2 mM SDS results in dissociation of capsid protein from RNA, an effect which suggests strong RNA-protein interaction. At 0.05 mM SDS the protein remains associated with the RNA, but the S-value is reduced from 150 S to 100 S. Electron micrographs of the 100 S ribonucleoprotein showed irregular and strand-like structures.\n",

      "Regulatory function of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the mitochondrion in lipogenesis. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase from freshly isolated mitochondria was shown to be dependent upon the nutritional and metabolic state of the animal prior to sacrifice, such that mitochondria from the livers of 48 hr starved, diabetic, or high fat fed rats had lower enzyme activity than normal, chow fed rats. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the rate of lipogenesis were shown to correlate to a certain extent when a reconstituted, cell free system consisting of 105,000 x g supernatant of rat liver and isolated mitochondria was used. This system was employed so that the role of the mitochondrion and pyruvate dehydrogenase in lipogenesis could be investigated. Dichloroacetate increased the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased the rate of lipogenesis, suggesting that the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is an important factor in determining the rate of lipogenesis in the reconstituted system. It was observed, however, that dichloroacetate was more effective in stimulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase than the rate of lipogenesis when mitochondria from starved animals were used to reconstitute lipogenesis. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratios and phosphorylation potentials (ATP/ADP x Pi) maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals were found to be significantly lower than those maintained by mitochondria isolated from chow fed animals. It is proposed that the lower \"energy pressure\" maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals severely limits lipogenesis at the ATP requiring steps of the process.\n",
      "Studies in vitro of lipogenesis in rat testicular tissue. Testicular tissue was shown to contain the full complement of enzymes required for de novo synthesis of fatty acids. The enzymes capable of snythesizing palmitic acid from citrate, acetate, or acetyl CoA were found to be present in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction. These included fatty acid synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, citrate-cleavage enzyme, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Optimal conditions for assaying activities of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl CoA carboxylase in the soluble fraction from rat testes were established, and the activities of these two enzymes were determined to be 0.54 +/- 0.1 and 0.030 +/- 0.002 (nmoles of substrate incorporated into fatty acid per min per mg of soluble fraction protein), respectively. The activities of citrate-cleavage enzyme, malic enzyme, and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase/6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase pair were also measured. The activities were 6.0 +/- 0.7, 34.9 +/- 4.2, and 29.9 +/- 9.3 nmoles/min/mg, respectively.\n",
      "Fatty acid synthesis from 2-14C-acetate in rat testis mitochondrial and cytosol fractions in vitro. An in vitro system for acetate incorporation into fatty acids by the mitochondrial and the cytosol fractions of rat testis is described. The rate of incorporation of acetate into fatty acids was twice as fast with the mitochondrial as with the cytosol fraction; both systems were stimulated in the presence of adenosine triphosphate, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, coenzyme A, and MgC1(2). The optimum pH was between 7.0-7.5 for the mitochondrial fraction and between 6.5-8.0 for the cytosol fraction. Radio gas chromatography showed that palmitic acid was the most highly labeled acid, followed by stearic acid, in the mitochondrial fraction in accord with the pathway of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Some of the labeled acetate was also incorporated into the 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids of this fraction. Distribution of radioactivity among the mitochondrial lipid classes was highest in the phospholipids and monoglycerides, followed by diglycerides and cholesterol; little radioactivity was present in the triglyceride fraction. These observations are in accord with studies of the incorporation of labeled metabolites into testicular lipids following intratesticular injection and indicate the validity of the in vitro system for studies of specific reactions occurring in vivo.\n",
      "Fat metabolism in higher plants: metabolism of medium chain fatty acids. Cell free preparations of avocado mesocarp and spinach leaf tissue rapidly convert lauryl CoA to DL-3-hydroxyl lauric acid as well as 2-, and 3-dodecanoic acids. The conversion does not occur under anaerobic conditions unless a suitable redox carrier such as ferredoxin is present. H2 18O is incorporated into the 3-hydroxyl function, but O2(18) is not. The characteristics of this system are presented and a possible function of this system is proposed.\n",
      "Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity in mammary adenocarcinomas carried by C3H mice. Transplantable mammary adenocarcinomas and livers of C3H mice fed a stock diet or a linoleate rich diet (15% corn oil) contain similar amounts of oleate (ca 3 mg/gm tissue). On feeding either a high carbohydrate, fat free or a high carbohydrate, saturated fat-containing (15% hydrogenated coconut or cottonseed oil) diet for 6 weeks, oleate levels increased 2-fold in tumor and 5-fold in liver. The specific activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in liver microsomes was similar to that in the corresponding fractions of mammary glands of lactating mice. In liver, this activity was enhanced 2- to 3-fold by feeding a high carbohydrate, fat free or a high carbohydrate, saturated fat diet. The desaturase activity in mammary tumor microsomes, while only 10% of that in hepatic microsomes, remained unaltered regardless of the type of diet fed. These observations suggest that (a) a major portion of the oleate in the mammary tumor is not produced within the tissue, (b) dietary adaptation is not a general characteristic of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in neoplastic tissues, and (c) enhanced desaturase activity in liver is directly related to the absence of linoleate or oleate, or to a large decrease in oleate in the diet.\n",
      "Iowa wrestling study: changes in the urinary profiles of wrestlers prior to and after competition. During the 1973 and 1974 state high school wrestling championships, urine samples were obtained from wrestlers prior to the weigh-in, immediately before they wrestled, and immediately after the subjects had completed their match. Specific gravity, osmolarity, pH, sodium and potassium determinations, as well as qualitative tests for protein and ketones, indicated that the wrestlers were in a dehydrated state at the time of weigh-in. After the five hour interim between the weigh-in and the first match, all but the pH measure remained essentially unchanged. This absence of significant changes in the urinary profile suggests that the wrestlers were unable to rehydrate during the five hour time period between the weigh-in and the first match and that they were competing in a dehydrated state. Urine samples collected after competition were significantly lower in specific gravity, osmolarity and potassium concentration than samples obtained before the match. The urinary potassium levels were of interest because at the three conditions (weigh-in, before the first match, after competition) they were 73-182% higher than values reported for high school students who were nonwrestlers.\n",

      "Polyarthritis, polyarteritis and hepatitis B. An association between viral hepatitis and two rheumatic disease syndromes has been observed. Twenty-nine patients manifested a transient polyarthritis, sometimes associated with a rash (Group I). Ten patients were seen with a multisystem disease (Group II). Histologic evidence of arteritis or glomerulonephritis was present in seven of ten patients with multisystem disease. Liver tissue from 18 patients showed morphologic evidence of hepatitis with viral features in 9 of 10 patients in Group I and in 6 of 8 patients in Group II. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibody to HBsAg were detected in sera of all 39 patients. Abnormal liver functions were present in 36. Twelve Group I patients and 2 Group II patients became jaundiced. Rheumatoid factor was present in sera of seven patients in each group. The third component of complement (C3) was depressed in 13 patients in Group I and 7 patients in Group II. The fourth component of complement (C4) was decreased in 8 of 21 Group I and 3 of 7 Group II patients. Synovial fluid C3 was decreased in 2 of 11 Group I and 1 of 4 Group II patient's fluids. Articular inflammation in patients with transient polyarthritis responded in three to seven days to aspirin, acetominophen and/or bedrest alone and rashes disappeared spontaneously. Patients with multisystem disease generally had a prolonged illness and responded somewhat unpredictably to prednisone or a combination of prednisone and cyclophosphamide.\n",
      "Some evidence for aldosterone action on 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level in human red cells. In healthy male subjects aldosterone excretion and plasma renin activity were reduced by a 4-6 hr head-out immersion in thermoindifferent water baths (35.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C). The red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) concentration before and throughout immersion period was positively correlated both with aldosterone excretion in 2 hr pooled urine (r = +0.69; 2 p less than 0.001) and with renin activity (r = + 0.54; 2p less than 0.001) despite a concomitant increase of cubital venous pH and inorganic phosphate concentration. These findings furnish evidence for a regulatory role of aldosterone in DPG metabolism, possibily by a direct influence on red cell glycolysis.\n",

      "[Factors causing lysis of an Actinomyces rimosus culture, the producer of the antibiotic, oxytetracycline]. The lysis of Actinomyces rimosus producing oxytetracycline during its mass growth can be caused by two factors which were separated by differential centrifugation. The first factor is phage particles of a temperate phage produced by the culture; they are incapable of growth but may induce the lysis. The phage particles treated with low pH and a temperature of 70 degrees C lose the lytic activity. The second factor is a lytic enzyme produced under the control of the temperate phage during its induction; it seems to consist of at least two enzymes, a lytic enzyme and a proteolytic enzyme.\n",
      "[Pulmonary vascular pressures and blood gases in young patients with thoracic scoliosis (author's transl)]. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressures were measured at rest and during exercise in 25 young patients with moderate to severe scoliosis. Simultaneous determinations of arterial blood gases and pH were performed. The results of the vascular pressure measurements were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy young subjects. In all patients the pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressure were normal at rest. During mild ergometer exercise, however, an abnormal rise in pulmonary artery pressure occurred in 9 patients. Moreover, an increased diastolic pressure gradient across the pulmonary vascular bed was found in some scoliotic patients indicating an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. It is supposed that this haemodynamic abnormality is primarily due to a restriction of the pulmonary vascular bed. Relationships between pulmonary artery pressure and arterial oxygen tension and blood pH, respectively, could be found. The possible significance of these results is discussed.\n",
      "Role of hyperkalemia in the metabolic acidosis of isolated hypoaldosteronism. We studied the relative importance of hyperkalemia and mineralocorticoid deficiency in the metabolic acidosis of a patient with proved isolated hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and moderate kidney failure. The hyperkalemia and acidosis were severe in relation to the slight azotemia. Despite the systemic acidosis and urinary pH of 4.9, urinary ammonium excretion was distinctly blunted. Correction of the hyperkalemia by potassium-sodium exchange resin alone resolved the acidosis and restored the previously diminished urinary ammonium excretion to normal. Administration of mineralocorticoids only partially corrected the hyperkalemia and the acidosis. Hyperkalemia by itself, rather than hypoaldosteronism per se, caused the acidosis in this patient. Hyperkalemia apparently suppresses urinary ammonium excretion and thus interferes with urinary acidification.\n",

      "Comparison of properties between virulent and attenuated strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Strains of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus possessing different pathogenicity were examined for stability to digestive enzymes and acid, and growth at various temperatures. In growth experiments, virus titer obtained at 37 degrees C were about equal between attenuated and virulent strains, but titers attained by the attenuated strain were higher at 30 degrees C. The attenuated virus multiplied at 28 degrees C, but the virulent virus did not at this temperature. The virulent virus was significantly stable to trypsin and pepsin, but the attenuated virus was inactivated rapidly by these proteolytic enzymes. No significant differences were observed in stability to acid between the attenuated and virulent strains. At different pH, both lost their infectivity more rapidly at 37 degrees C than at 22 degrees C.\n",

The initial cell count, 40 X 10(4)/ml, increased to 200 X 10(4)/ml on the 4th day of culture. The suspension culture of HmLu-1 cells was proved satisfactory for propagation of Ibaraki virus. The viral titer reached a maximum of 10(6.75) TCID50/0.1 ml. The input multiplicity ranging from 0.003 to 3.0 exerted no influence on the final yield of the virus. The optimal pH value of initial culture ranged from 6.8 to 7.6. In comparison of virus yield per cell among the suspension culture and two methods of monolayer culture in stationary and rolling condition, there was no noticeable difference in it among the three methods. The cell population per unit volume was the largest and, therefore, virus titer in the culture fluid the highest in the suspension culture of the three methods.\n",
      "Studies on the mechanism of the action of morphine on the peristalsis of guinea pig ileum in situ. The influence of some drugs on the effect of morphine on the threshold pressure required to elicit peristalsis in the guinea pig ileum in situ was studied, in order to test the hypothesis that this effect of morphine is mediated by catecholamine release. Tachyphylaxis to this effect of morphine was confirmed. Pretreatemnt with two 8 mg/kg doses of reserpine, 24 and 48 hrs before the experiment, significantly reduced the effect of morphine on the pressure threshold. The i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg dl-Dopa re-established the effect of morphine in reserpinized animals to the level of the untreated controls. Pretreatment with guanethidine (15 mg/kg) decreased and even prevented this effect of morphine. Phentolamine pretreatment (10 mg/kg) also significantly inhibited the effect of morphine. Neither DCI nor propranolol influenced this morphine effect. Pretreatment with reserpine, guanethidine or phentolamine reduced the basic pressure threshold needed to elicit peristalsis. The possibility that the decrease of local circulation induced by hypotenison would reduce the local concentration of morphine was rejected because the same doses of guanethidine or phentolamine did not modify the effect of hexamethonium given i.v. in this preparation. All these results support the idea that the effect of morphine on intestinal peristalsis is mediated by a catecholamine acting on alpha-receptors, e.g. norepinephrine.\n",
      "Effects of alpha-ketomonocarboxylic acids upon insulin secretion and metabolism of isolated pancreatic islets. In perifused isolated pancreatic islets alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) or alpha-ketocaproic acid (KC) induced a high insulin secretion rate and a steep increase of the fluorescence of reduced pyridine pyridine nucleotides [NAD(P)H] which fell again to almost prestimulatory levels 6 min after medium change. Insulin release in response to alpha-ketooctanoic (KO) acid started slowly and was accompanied by a decrease of the NAD(P)H-fluorescence trace. Beta-phenylpyruvate which is known to initiate insulin release also caused a fluorescence decrease. Alpha-keto-isovaleric (KIV) acid or pyruvate had no significant effects upon insulin secretion or NAD(P)H-fluorescence. In contrast to l-leucine, l-norleucine or l-valine did not enhance insulin release or fluorescence of NAD(P)H. KIV, alpha-keto-beta-methylvaleric acid (KMV), KIC and KC raised the production their corresponding amino acids by islet cells. From these results it is concluded that alpha-ketomonocarboxylic acids as such trigger insulin release by acting upon receptor sites which differ from those occupied by amino acids.\n",
      "The preparation and properties of nerve growth factor protein at alkaline pH. The nerve growth factor (NGF) subunit of 7S NGF was isolated by chromatography at high pH on QAE-Sephadex. It has the same specific NGF activity as betaNGF isolated at acid pH, showing that this activity is an intrinsic property of the subunit and is independent of the pathway of dissociation. Continued exposure of the NGF subunit to high pH resulted in an increase in the amount of the minor species beta2NGF and the formation of a new species, beta3NGF, of even lower isoelectric point. These two species and the original major species of the preparation, beta1, were isolated by isoelectric focusing. All three species had the same specific NGF activity, but differed in their ability to reform 7S NGF. The beta2 species was one-fifth as competent as beta1, while beta3 was unable to regenerate 7S NGF. Addition of alpha- and gamma-subunits to beta1NGF decreased the amount of NGF protein required to produce one Biological Unit of activity in the bioassay, but had no effect when added to beta3NGF. The interactions between the subunits in 7S NGF therefore determine, in part, the specific activity of the NGF subunit.\n",
      "Concanavalin A-binding glycopeptides from rat brain glycoproteins. The affinity of concanavalin A for neutral and acidic glycopeptides derived from rat brain glycoproteins was investigated by studying the inhibition of a concanavalin A-glycogen precipitation system. The neutral, mannose-rich glycopeptides obtained by column electrophoresis of the dialyzable glycopeptides that had been solubilized by proteolytic treatment of defatted brain tissue were powerful inhibitors, with an inhibitory activity 20 to 26 times that of the standard inhibitor, methyl-alpha-D-mannoside. The acidic sialoglycopeptides had activities one to nine times that of the mannoside. Therefore, both acid and neutral glycopeptides were capable of interacting with concanavalin A. The especially strong affinity of the neutral mannose-rich glycopeptides, however, enabled their retention on concanavalin A-Sepharose and subsequent elution with methyl-alpha-D-mannoside. This provided the means of separation of the acidic sialoglycopeptides from the neutral, mannose-rich glycopeptides by affinity chromatography. Glycopeptides that contain N-acetylgalactosamine are not retained by concanavalin A-Sepharose.\n",
      "The use of hybrid molecules in a study of the equilibrium between nerve growth factor monomers and dimers. The major protein in beta nerve growth factor preparations, beta1NGF, is a dimer in which both peptide chains have COOH-terminal arginine residues. Digestion of beta1NGF with carboxypeptidase B produced a dimer, beta3NGF, in which both chains lack these terminal arginine residues. Exposure of mixtures of beta1 and beta3NGF dimers to 8 M urea to produce monomers, followed by removal of urea to allow recombination, resulted in the formation of the hybrid beta2NGF, comprising one arginine-containing and one arginine-less chain, as well as the parent dimers. The amount of the three dimers formed was close to that expected from random association of monomers. Hybrid beta2NGF was also formed from mixtures of beta1 and beta3NGF where incubated at pH 2.6 to 4.5. The formation of beta2NGF has a half-time of 6 h at pH 4.0 and 4 degrees C. Its rate of formation decreased above pH 4.5, becoming minimal between pH 9.5 and pH 10.5, and increased with increasing temperature. The amount of beta2NGF formed was determined by the lowest pH to which the parent mixture was exposed, irrespective of its prior history. These data suggest that the hybrid is formed by the same mechanism in the absence and presence of the urea step. An approximate value for Kd, the equilibrium dissociation constant of the dimer equilibrium monomer equilibrium was derived. Its value was 3 - 10(-10) M at pH 4.0 and 4 degrees C. The alpha-subunit of 7S NGF decreased the rate of formation of beta2NGF not only at pHs where an alphabeta complex is stable, but also at an acid pH where no complex formation is observed by sedimentation analysis, suggesting that the present methodology offers a more sensitive probe of subunit interactions. In contrast, the gamma subunit and a number of indifferent proteins had little or no effect on the appearance of beta2NGF at the pHs studied.\n",
      "Changes in hypothalamic neurotransmitter uptake following pinealectomy, superior cervical ganglionectomy or melatonin administration to rats. Rats subjected to pinealectomy or to pinealectomy plus bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy exhibited depressed serotonin uptake by hypothalamic synaptosomes; norepinephrine, dopamine or glutamate uptake was not affected by any of the surgical procedures. Treatment with melatonin resulted in inhibition of hypothalamic serotonin accumulation but it did not modify the uptake of norepinephrine, dopamine or glutamate. These data suggest a relationship between the pineal gland and the serotoninergic nerve endings of the hypothalamus.\n",
      "Timolol maleate (Blocadren) in the treatment of essential hypertension. The antihypertensive activity of timolol (Blocadren, FROSST-MSD), a new beta blocking agent, was assessed in a single blind crossover placebo-controlled study in 14 patients with essential hypertension. Ten patients completed the trial. The average standing pressure during the placebos periods was 168/109mmHg and during the periods on treatment with timolol the average standing pressure was 139/92mmHg. All 10 patients showed some hypotensive response. The average daily dosage was 21 mg with a range of 15-30 mg. Four patients achieved optimal levels of blood pressure by the end of one week's therapy with the maximum time required being four weeks. Timolol appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent. Side effects were insignificant.\n",
      "Effects of ritodrine hydrochloride on uterine activity and the cardiovascular system in toxemic patients. The effects of ritodrine hydrochloride were evaluated in 25 toxemic patients in active labor utilizing continuous electronic monitoring of fetal and maternal cardiovascular systems and uterine activity. Fetal scalp blood and free flowing maternal antecubital venous blood was obtained for pH, Po2, Pco2, base deficit and blood glucose determinations prior to and immediately following the study period. The initial ritodrine dose was 50 mug/min for 15 minutes. The dose was increased by 50 mug/min each 15 minutes until there was a clinically apparent reduction in uterine activity. Once this was accomplished, the infusion was maintained for 30 minutes. There was a consistent increase in the maternal heart rate (MHR) and a significant rise in fetal heart rate (FHR) late in the infusion and in the postinfusion period. There was a widening of the maternal pulse pressure mainly due to a reduction in diastolic pressure with little change in the mean blood pressure. Maternal and fetal pH decreased and base deficit increased during the study although the PO2 and PCO2 remained unchanged. Maternal and fetal blood glucose rose significantly following ritodrine infusion.\n",

Jovian plants have enviroments apparently suitable for the evolution of life, but nevertheless, present severe challenges to organisms. One such challenge arises from the presence of ammonia. Ammonia is an efficient biocide, its effect being dependent on pH as well as on concentration. The effects of pH and ammonia concentration were studied separately, where possible, on a variety of organisms, including some isolated from natural enviornments of high pH and/or ammonia concentration. Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are both extremely sensitive to ammonia. An aerobic organism (growth up to pH 11.4) from an alkaline spring is more resistant, but exhibits a toxic response to ammonia at a pH much lower than its maximum for growth. The greatest ammonia resistance has been found in an unidentified organism growing at near neutral pH. Even in this case, however, survival at ammonia concentrations reasonably expected on the Jovian planets is measured in hours. This is, nevertheless, two to three orders of magnitude longer than for E. coli. Our data support the tentative conclusion that contamination of the Jovian planets with terrestrial organisms that can grow is unlikely. However, the range of toxic response noted, coupled with the observation that terrestrial life has not been exposed to high ammonia concentrations for millions of years, suggests that adaptation to greater ammonia tolerance may be possible.\n",
      "Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase in the rat liver after portacaval shunt. Gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTP) activity was studied in livers of rats submitted to an end-to-side portacaval shunt (PCS) and in developing animals. To correlate the evolution of the enzymatic activity measured in vitro, histochemical techniques were used to localize enzyme activity in liver tissue. The GGTP activity in the adult rats was low and amounted to 2.0 +/- 0.1 mumol/min/g. During fetal development the enzyme activity rose beginning on the 15th gestational day from 630 +/- 97 to 1,058 +/- 20 on the first postnatal day. Then the values declined and reached nearly adult values from the 10th postnatal day. After PCS the GGTP activity exhibited a three- to sixfold increase (130 +/- 69 to 371 +/- 131) as compared with unoperated adult controls (53 +/- 13). the highest levels corresponded to those observed between the 3rd and 5th postnatal day in the developing rats. The histochemistry of GTTP in the fetal and newborn liver showed a regular distribution of the enzyme as a fine deposit in the hepatocytes throughout the whole tissue. Ten days after birth the activity was low, at the same level as in the adult rat. In the period after PCS hepatocytes began to show signs of enzymatic activity at the periphery of the hepatic lobules, which subsequently spread through the whole lobules. The increase of GGTP activity after PCS equaled the activity found in fetal animals. That correlated well in both groups with the reappearance of histologically demonstrable enzyme activity in hepatocytes.\n",
      "Cardiovascular effects of electrical stimulation of the forebrain in the fetal lamb. Modified stereotaxic techniques were applied to fetal lambs during the latter third of gestation. Electrical stimulation in the region of the hypothalamus in 10 acute experiments was associated with three patterns of arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes: a pressor-tachycardia response; a pure tachycardia response (abolished by propranolol); and a pure bradycardia response (abolished by atropine). The pressor-tachycardia response was examined in detail in 13 chronic preparations (115-135 days of gestation at operation). The systolic arterial blood pressure increase was never greater than 35 mm Hg and was probably blunted by the large noninnervated placental circulation. This pressure increase was abolished by phentolamine and was thus mediated by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The initial tachycardia was prevented by propranolol and was due to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The tachycardia was followed in a few seconds by a bradycardia, abolished by atropine and possibly a vagal baroreflex. The pressor-tachycardia response was accentuated in two lambs who were delivered spontaneously and were studied after birth. These studies indicate that a suprabulbar neural framework exists in the fetal lamb for influencing the cardiovascular system from as early as 90 days of gestation.\n",
      "Elevated levels of immunoglobulin E in the acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS) is a newly recognized disease characterized by fever persisting for more than 5 days, an erythematous skin eruption, conjunctival congestion, dry red fissured lips, reddened tongue, palms, and soles, nonpurulent lymphadenopathy, and sometines diarrhea, arthralgia, and aseptic meningitis. Additional features may include carditis, pericarditis, aneurysmal dilation and thrombosis of coronary arteries, and sudden death. There is a striking similarity of fatal cases to infantile polyarteritis nodosa, a disease recently reported to be associated with elevated levels of serium IgE. Indeed, it is likely that MCLS represents a disease which can progress to polyarteritis nodosa in infants and young children. The paired acute and convalescent serum IgE levels of 20 subjects with acute nonfatal MCLS were studied along with 20 near-age unaffected controls from the same communities in Japan. The results indicate that most if not all subjects with MCLS in the study had an elevation of total serum IgE during the acute phase of the disease (geometric mean 157 IU/ml compared with the control value of 38 IU/ml, P = 0.005). The level appeared to reach a peak 1-2 weeks after onset and declined over the ensuing 1-2 months.\n",
      "Diminished pulmonary lecithin synthesis in acidosis: experimental findings as related to the respiratory distress syndrome. Lung slices from term fetal rats were incubated in vitro at various pH values and the rates of the two de novo pathways for lecithin biosynthesis were determined by measuring the conversion of either 14C-choline (pathway 1) or 14C-methionine (pathway 2) to the phospholipid. It was observed that the choline pathway, but not phosphatidylethanolamine methylation, is pH-sensitive with maximum rates occurring at pH levels between 7.3 and 7.5; significantly less activity was found at pH levels between 7.0 and 7.2 and at pH levels between 7.6 and 8.0. Adjustment of the pH from 7.0 to 7.4 in vitro simulating the clinical correction of acidosis by alkali infusion was found to increase the conversion of choline to lecithin to a rate approximating that observed at pH 7.4. Since lecithins are the principal phospholipid components of pulmonary surfactant, and since pathway 1 is predominantly responsible for lung lecithin synthesis, the demonstration of impaired production with reduced pH offers a biochemical explanation for the pathophysiological effects of acidosis in the respiratory distress syndrome. A comparison of pH effects on choline pathway rate with the pH profiles of pathway enzymes suggests that these effects are mediated by the catalysts of lecithin synthesis.\n",
      "pH and bicarbonate excretion in the rat parotid gland as a function of salivary rate. The bicarbonate concentration in rat parotid saliva increases with increasing flow rates and approximates plasma values at highest salivation. At lowest flow rates the bicarbonate concentration in the secretory fluid markedly exceeds the plasma levels. Intravenous administration of acetazolamide has no influence on the bicarbonate excretion of the parotid gland. Following retrograde application of acetazolamide into the gland duct the concentrations of both bicarbonate and sodium are elevated. The potassium concentrations in final saliva exceed 70 mEq/l at flow rates below 5 mul/min g gland weight. With increasing flow rates a precipitous decrease in potassium concentration below 10 mEq/l occurs. With further increase in flow rate the potassium concentration remains unchanged. The sodium concentrations increased with augmented salivation rate. At lowest flow rates the sodium concentrations showed an increase of modest degree. Our findings can best be explained by the existence of two independent ductular mechanism: a) bicarbonate reabsorption probably in the striated ducts of the parotid gland; b) secretion of potassium with concomitand secretion of bicarbonate in the main excretory duct.\n",
      "H+ transport and membrane-bound HCO - 3 ATPase in salivary duct epithelium. An ATPase stimulated by HCO -  ions and other oxybases and inhibited by SCN- has been found in main excretory duct of rat submaxillary gland, a tissue, capable of actively secreting HCO - 3 ions. No such ATPase was found in the rabbit duct, which normally does not secrete HCO - 3. The HCO - 3 ATPase was localized in the plasma membrane fraction of the homogenate, as evidenced by the marker 5'-nucleotidase. The activities of the HCO - 3 ATPase increased in metabolic alkalosis and decreased in metabolic acidosis in parallel to secretion of HCO - 3 and K+ ions by the duct epithelium. These findings provide further evidence that the membrane-bound HCO - 3 ATPase is involved in active H+/HCO - 3 transport.\n",
      "Effects of cyanide and doxapram during hypothermia. The ventilatory responses, blood gases and acid-base status to intravenous injections of KCN and doxapram hydrochloride were studied in anesthetized dogs during normothermia and at two levels of hypothermia. In the normothermic animal, KCN evoked significant elevations of minute and alveolar ventilations. For the mildly hypothermic (32-33 degrees C) dog, minute and alveolar ventilations were proportionally greater than for normothermia. Bolus infusions of KCN to deeply hypothermic dogs (28-29 degrees C) elicited larger and nearly similar increases of minute and alveolar ventilations as compared, respectively, with normothermia and mild hypothermia. Compared to their controls, injections of doxapram during normothermia, mild and deep hypothermia augmented VE 43.3%, 63.6% and 31.5%, respectively. With doxapram there was a feeble increase in alveolar ventilation. These results demonstrate that the peripheral (arterial) chemoreceptors preserve the capacity to respond to stimuli given acutely while lowering core temperature and in some circumstances this capacity is even enhanced as compared to normothermia.\n",
      "Effects of cyanide and doxapram during panting. The ventilatory responses, blood gases and acid-base status to intravenous injections of KCN and doxapram hydrochloride were studied in anesthetized dogs during normothermia and thermally induced panting. In the normothermic animal, KCN evoked elevation of VE (154.7%), VT (70.1%), f (48.3%, PaO2 (12.1%) and pH (0.098 units), while PaCO2 diminished by 9.7 mm Hg. During panting, KCN infusions resulted in increases of VE (24.5%), VT (46.6%), PaO2 (3.9%) and pH (0.034 units), while f decreased (10.1%). Bolus injections of doxapram during normothermia increased VE (32.6%), VT (18.8%) and f (17.1%). During panting VE, VT and f increased by 18.0%, 18.2% and 1.5%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the peripheral (arterial) chemoreceptors preserve the capacity to react to acute chemical stimuli in animals in which the thermal stimuli override the normal chemical control of respiration in order to control body temperature, and that this reaction contributes to the integrated respiratory drive.\n",
      "The effect of alpha-adrenolytics on the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in rat's brain. Alpha-Adrenolytics (ABA)-phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine and aceperone-increase 5-hydroxyindoleacetic (5-HIAA) acid content in rat's brain. At the same time, these compounds either increase or do not affect 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level. Moreover, they potentiate L-dopa and reserpine-induced increase in 5-HIAA level and antagonized clonidine-induced decrease in 5-HIAA content. The experiments with probenecid indicate that the observed increase in 5-HIAA does not result from the deficient elimination of the metabolite from brain. The increase in 5-HT turnover in brain, due to ABA, is suggested.\n",
      "Combating diabetic ketoacidosis and other hyperglycemic-ketoacidotic syndromes. Diabetic ketoacidosis is an acute medical emergency that requires immediate diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis may be established rapidly by measurement of urinary glucose and ketones, arterial blood pH and blood gases, and serum ketones. Rapid infusion of large volumes of fluids and electrolytes, together with continuous infusion of low doses of insulin, provides effective restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance and correction of metabolic derangements. Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma is characterized by marked hyperglycemia in the absence of ketoacidosis and occurs usually in patients with mild adult-onset diabetes. Symptoms develop more slowly than in diabetic ketoacidosis. Treatment is the same for both conditions. In alcoholic ketoacidosis, hyperketonemia is present without hyperglycemia. The syndrome differs from diabetic ketoacidosis in that blood glucose levels are lower and glycosuria is absent. Treatment consists of intravenous administration of dextrose in water and, if necessary, of sodium bicarbonate. Insulin administration usually is not necessary.\n",
      "[Current conception of the Bohr effect]. The molecular mechanism of the Bohr effect is explained according to the molecular model proposed by Perutz et al. The Bohr effect is due to changes in the pK of specific carboxyl and amino groups of the four globin chains following the transition between the deoxy and oxy conformations of the molecule. Carbon dioxide binds to the N terminal valine of the 4 monomers to form carbamino compounds. This carbaminoformation depends upon pH, PCO2 and predominates on deoxygenated haemoglobin. It is lowered when O2 binds to the heme groups (O2 linked carbamino compounds). Through the carbamino compounds Carbon dioxide lowers both the affinity of haemoglobin for O2 and the Bohr effect. Diphosphoglycerate also binds to the haemoglogin molecule. This organophosphate lowers the affinity for O2 but increases the Bohr effect. In whole blood, the Bohr effect is therefore dependent upon pH, O2 saturation, PCO2 and DPG concentration into the red blood cells.\n",

      "[Study of P50 in patients under continuous O2 inhalation and during chronic respiratory acidosis]. In vitro, the affinity of Hb for O2 depends on pH and capnia by the intermediate of the 2-3 DPG level, the concentration of which lowers in the case of acidosis and hypercapnia. Thus, an increase in the affinity results, but while Bohr's effect is immediate, on the contrary the 2-3 DPG effect is slow. Authors have verified the importance of this modification by studying the affinity of Hb for O2 thanks to the P50 technique in 15 normal non-smokers subjects and in 10 subjects with compensated or not respiratory acidosis but normally saturated thanks to continuous O2 administration.\n",

      "[Effect of cultivation conditions on the synthesis of citric and isocitric acids in Candida lipolytica on hexadecane medium]. The influence of aeration, pH and iron concentration on the growth of yeast C. lipolytica 704 on the hexadecane medium and on the synthesis of citric and isocitric acids was investigated. The yeast synthesized citric acids actively during intensive aeration. The acid formation was strongly dependent on the medium acidity: pH 6.0 was most favourable  for the synthesis of citric acids. The Fe concentration influenced significantly the ratio of the acids synthesized. At a low concentration of iron (0.005 mg Fe/l) equal amounts of citrate and isocitrate were formed; at an increased concentration isocitrate was in predominant formation.\n",
      "[Study of inosine transformation into 5'-inosinic acid by the culture of Pseudomonas trifoli]. The transformation of inosine into 5'-inosine acid by Pseudomonas trifolii cells was studied. The synthesis of 5'-inosine acid can be performed by both live intact and dry cells. The effectiveness of inosine phosphorylation depends on the ratio of the inosine and phosphate donor concentrations and the amount of cells. The temperature and pH effect on activity of nucleoside phosphotransferase, phosphomonoesterase and 5'-nucleotidase has been studied. The influence of surface active substances and metal ions on the synthesis of 5'-inosine acid has been investigated. Optimal conditions for the inosine transformation by the above culture have been established.\n",
      "[Effect of pH on the enzymic activity of the fungi Trichothecium roseum and Aspergillus niger hydrolyzing nonstarch polysaccharides]. The purpose of the study was to determine optimal pH values for the enzymic activity of the fungi Trichothecium roseum and Aspergillus niger hydrolyzing nonstarch polysaccharides of barley and disrupting cell walls (cytolysis) of grain, the so called cytolytic enzymes. The effect of the acidity of the medium on the stability of these enzymes was also investigated. In this connection total cytolytic activity (i. e. total activity of the enzymes hydrolyzing nonstarch polysaccharides of cell walls of barley) and hemicellulase activity of the fungi at different pH values were measured. The activity of these enzymes in aqueous extracts from the fungal culture at optimal pH after preincubation was determined at different acidity levels. The optimum of the hemicellulase activity of both fungi was at 4.6, the optimum of the total cytolytic activity of Tr. roseum at pH 5.6 and of Asp. niger at pH 3.0. The enzymes of the fungus Asp. niger showed a far higher acid stability than those of Tr. roseum.\n",

Thiamine pyrophosphokinase (EC 2.7.7.2) isolated from dry brewing yeast has been purified 20-fold with a 70% yield. Certain properties of the enzyme have been determined: pH and temperature optima, donor and acceptor concentrations, and relationship between the rate of cocarboxylase biosynthesis and the incubation time and the enzyme quantity. The effects of concentrations of bivalent metal ions Co2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+ on the rate of the enzymic reaction has been studied. A change in the pH optimum as a function of the nature of the ion-activator has been investigated. It has been shown that neopyrithiamin is a competitive inhibitor and oxythiamin inhibits the enzymic reaction insignificantly. Thiamine phosphate cannot be transformed into thiamine diphosphate by the purified enzyme.\n",
      "[Trypsin interaction with sodium alginate]. The formation of an insoluble product of the interaction of trypsin and sodium alginate at pH 3-9 was studied. The optic density of the system was in an extreme relation to the composition. The insoluble phase was enriched in trypsin. The dispersion phase formed as a result of the electrostatic interaction between alginate macroanion and trypsin macrocation. The interaction brought about the formation of ATn, where n=90-900 (with an accuracy of the term Mw/Mn of alginate). The relation between the composition of the complex and pH was nonmonotonous.\n",

The paper describes studies of heat treatment of the preparations amylorizin G10x, amylosubtilin G10x and glucoendomycopsin G15 and its effect on the relationshop between the rate of the enzymic reaction and the preparation concentration, optimal pH and temperatures, and the EDTA influence on the activity of heated preparations. After heating the preparations showed an elevation of optimal temperatures of their action and a shift of optimal pH to the alkaline region. Primary heating of the preparations resulted in an increase of the rate of the enzymic reaction. Heated preparations were less susceptible to the effect of the inhibitor that nonheated ones.\n",
      "[Effect of pH on the properties of the chemostatic culture of Canida utilis]. The effect of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions on the physiological features of the yeast C. utilis VKMU-1668 was studied. High acidity inhibited yeast growth and uncoupled pathways of the energy and constructive metabolism: normal respiration was disturbed and the electron transport chain was damaged in the site of cytochromes and not flavins. Hydroxyl ions also inhibited yeast growth and uncoupled pathways of the energy and constructive metabolism: oxygen uptake and the content of flavin adenone dinucleotide increased, dehydrogenase activity upon the use of glycerol decreased significantly, and the absolute amount of all cytochromes declined slightly. The chemical composition of cellular polymers at all pH values tested was stable enough. The amount of major metabolites--volatile oils and ketoacids--was insignificant.\n",
      "[Activation of L-amino acids by aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases from yeast Candida utilis IBPM-405]. The procedure for isolating aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases from yeast Candida utilis IBPM-405 was developed. The rate of activation of L-amino acids in the formation of hydroxamates was different. Aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, tryptophane, phenyl alanine and methionine underwent the highest activation. The activation of alanine, arginine, hydroxyproline, serine and isoleucine was insignificant. Using aspartic acid, it was shown that the hydroxamate formation was ATP-stimulated and that the amount of hydroxamate increased with a rise of the protein concentration in the mixture to 9-10 mg/ml. The hydroxamate formation was inhibited by p-chloromercury-benzoate and heavy metal ions. Yeast aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases showed L-aspartic and L-glutamic activities that were independent from Mg++ ions and ATP.\n",
      "[Properties of immobilized trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin and their use for purification of proteinase inhibitors from potatoes]. Immobilized trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin were obtained as a result of the enzyme attachment to bromo-cyanogen activated cepharose. Proteolytic activity (substrate--casein) of immobilized trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin was 18.7 and 9%, respectively and their esterase activity with methyl ester benzoyl-L-arginine (trypsin) and ethyl ester acetyl-L-tyrosine (alpha-chymotrypsin) was 75 and 20% of that of soluble enzymes. Immobilized enzymes were used to purify proteinase inhibitors from potatoes by affine chromatography. Specific activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors was increased 10 and 6 times, respectively. By isoelectric focussing it was shown that the purified preparation of chymotrypsin inhibitors consisted of two acid proteins and one alkaline protein, the latter being in predominance. The purified preparation of trypsin inhibitors contained equal amounts of proteins with the isoelectric point at pH 7.1 and 8.9 and a low quantity of the component with the isoelectric point at pH 5.7.\n",

      "[Effect of different pH values on the activity and quaternary structure of asparaginase in Escherichia coli extracts]. The effect of low pH values on the activity and stability of the quaternary structure of asparaginase from Escherichia coli was investigated at early stages of purification of the enzyme. Acidification of the E. coli extract was most effective before the biomass separation. This procedure helped to separate biomass together with coagulated ballast proteins and not to reduce the activity. Upon storage of the acidified solution at 5 degrees C reversible dissociation of the tetrametric structure into dimers and monomers occurred. Stability of L-asparaginase in the storage of acetone powders and during extraction was studied. It is suggested that asparaginase in bacterial cells in unlikely to have the quaternary structure which normally occurs in the solution at neutral pH.\n",

      "[Analysis of acid proteinases from Aspergillus terricola]. The specific action and composition of the functional groups of active centres of three fractions of acid proteinases from Aspergillus terricola have been studied. With respect to the hydrolysis rates of acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-tyrosine and carbobenzoxy-D, L-glycyl-phenylalanine by the three fractions it is suggested that the interaction of acid proteinases with the substrate involves hydrophobic forces. It has been shown that the above fractions are no metal enzymes. By means of the diazocarbonyl inhibitor an occurrence of a catalytically active carboxy group has been found in the active centre of proteinases. The proteinase inhibition by Fe3+ in the presence of citric acid is an indirect evidence of the existence of several carboxy groups and, possibly, of a hydroxy group in the active centre of acid proteinases from Aspergillus terricola.\n",
      "[Thermo- and pH-stability of soluble and silichrome-80 immobilized proteinase from Bacillus subtilis].

For protosubtilin G10x the pH optimum was 7.0-7.2. For the immobilized preparation 96-100% activity was found at pH 5.5-10.0. The difference between the two proteinase preparations was more distinct with respect to the temperature minimum. The initial preparation-protosubtilin G10x was more stable to low temperature and showed maximum activity at 40 degrees; the immobilized preparation was less active at low temperatures and showed maximum activity at 60-70 degrees. Protosubtilin G10x was more sensitive to pH changes, especially in the acid zone (pH 4.5). It was significantly activated at 30-40 degrees and was unstable at 50-60 degrees.

      "Regulation of synthesis of glutamine synthetase by adenylylated glutamine synthetase. We have examined three mutants of Klebsiella aerogenes whose genetic lesions (glnB, glnD, and glnE) are in loci unlinked to the structural gene for glutamine sythetase (glnA) and in which the control of both the level and state of adenylylation of glutamine synthetase is altered. Each mutation alters a different component of the adenylylation system of glutamine synthetase [L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.3.1.2]. Inability of the cell to deadenylylate glutamine synthetase (glnB and glnD) greatly decreases its production, while inability to adenylylate glutamine sythetase (glnE) results in its constitutively high production. These results together with our previous results indicate that adenylylated glutamine synthetase inhibits the transcription of glnA.\n",

      "Regulation of ferredoxin-catalyzed photosynthetic phosphorylations. Under aerobic conditions that are likely to prevail in chloroplasts in vivo, the optimal concentration of ferredoxin for cyclic photophosphorylation was found to be equal to that required for NADP reduction and about one-tenth of that needed for cyclic photophosphorylation under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of ferredoxin and NADP, cyclic photophosphorylation operated concurrently with noncyclic photophosphorylation, producing an ATP: NADPH ratio of about 1.5. The effective operation of ferredoxin-catalyzed cyclic photophosphorylation by itself required a curtailment of the electron flow from water which was accomplished experimentally by the use of either an inhibitor or far-red monochromatic light. An unexpected discovery was that the operation of cyclic photophosphorylation by itself was also regulated by a back reaction of NADPH and ferredoxin with two components of chloroplast membranes, component C550 and cytochrome b559. The significance of these findings to photosynthesis in vivo is discussed.\n",
      "High resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies of intact yeast cells. High resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra at 145.7 MHZ are presented for intact yeast cells. Several peaks are resolved and assigned. They include the middle phosphate peaks from long chain or cyclic polyphosphates. Our results are consistent with the suggestion that these polyphosphates act as a phosphate store in the cell. We have also been able to measure cytoplasmic pH using the orthophosphate peak inside the cell, as compared with outside the cell. The results show that yeast cells maintain their cytoplasmic pH around 6.3. This value is considerably higher than the acidic extracellular pH at which they normally live. These preliminary results indicate that 31P NMR at 145.7 MHZ can be a rapid, informative, and non-invasive method for probing biochemical events within living cells.\n",
      "Reversal of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase deficiency of human leukocytes in culture. Stimulation with phytohemagglutinin of the leukocytes from six of the seven known individuals with UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (= UDP-glucose 4-epimerase; EC 5.1.3.2) deficiency consistently resulted in the appearance of epimerase activity in the cultured cells. A long-term lymphoblast culture derived from one proband also contained an active epimerase enzyme. A comparison of the properties of this enzyme with those of epimerase produced by control lymphoblast lines revealed comparable Km values for UDP-galactose and NAD and identical behavior on polyacrylamide electrophoresis. However, a difference in the NAD requirement for heat stability at 40 degree provided some evidence for a structural defect in this enzyme. Possible explanations for the appearance of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase activity in stimulated lymphocytes include an increased rate of synthesis of a mutant enzyme and a derepression of an epimerase locus during lymphocyte transformation.\n",
      "beta-Bungarotoxin, a pre-synaptic toxin with enzymatic activity. beta-Bungarotoxin, a pre-synaptic neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the snake Bungarus multicinctus, has been shown to modify release of neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction. In this communication, we demonstrate that beta-bungarotoxin is a potent phospholipase A2 (phosphatide 2-acyl hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.4), comparable in activity with purified phospholipase enzymes from Naja naja and Vipera russellii. The phospholipase activity of beta-bungarotoxin requires calcium and is stimulated by deoxycholate. When strontium replaces calcium, no phospholipase activity is detected. Since neuromuscular transmission is not blocked when calcium is replaced by strontium, it was possible to examine the effects of the toxin on neuromuscular transmission in the presence of strontium. Under these conditions, when the phospholipase activity should be inhibited, the toxin has little or no effect on neuromuscular transmission. If beta-bungarotoxin owes its toxicity in part to its enzymatic activity, then it must be placed in a different class from those toxins which produce their effect by binding passively to an appropriate receptor.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of an unsaturated fatty acid-requiring mutant of cultured mammalian cells. An unsaturated fatty acid-requiring mutant derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been isolated and characterized. This mutant grows normally when oleate or other unsaturated fatty acids are supplemented in the growth medium. Unlike the wild-type CHO cells, growth stops when medium is deprived of unsaturated fatty acid. Whole cell pulse experiments with [14C]acetate or [14C]stearate indicate that the mutant is defective in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Enzyme assays in vitro show that the enzymatic defect of the mutant is localized to the microsomal stearoyl-CoA desaturase.\n",
      "DNA single-strand breaks during repair of UV damage in human fibroblasts and abnormalities of repair in xeroderma pigmentosum. The method of DNA alkaline elution was applied to a study of the formation and resealing of DNA single-strand breaks after irradiation of human fibroblasts with ultraviolet light (UV). The general features of the results were consistent with current concepts of DNA excision repair, in that breaks appeared rapidly after UV, and resealed slowly in normal fibroblasts, whereas breaks did not appear in those cells of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) that are known to have defects in DNA repair synthesis. The appearance of breaks required a short post-UV incubation, consistent with the expected action of an endonuclease. Cells of the variant form of XP characterized by normal DNA repair synthesis exhibited normal production of breaks after UV, but were slower than normal cells in resealing these breaks. This difference was enhanced by caffeine. A model is proposed to relate this finding with a previously described defect in post-replication repair in these XP variant cells. DNA crosslinking appears to cause an underestimate in the measurement of DNA breakage after UV.\n",
      "Modifications of purified glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and other enzymes by a factor of low molecular weight abundant in some leukemic cells. Highly purified platelet glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) can be modified in its isoelectric point and its molecular specific activity by extracts of some leukemic granulocytes. The \"G6PD modifying factors\" are relatively small molecules (molecular weight slightly under 5000), thermostable, dialyzable, and ultrafilterable. These molecules are destroyed by various endo- and exopeptidases and by serine enzymes present in crude extracts of leukocytes and commercial preparations of ribonuclease. The alterations of platelet G6PD due to the \"G6PD modifying factors\" are stable and not reversible by dialysis or further chromatography. The leukemic extracts which are able to modify G6PD also can modify the electrophoretic mobility and (or) the enzymatic activity of purified leukocyte pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and glucosephosphate isomerase. The chemical nature of such modifications and their relationships with post-translational modifications which occur in leukemic or normal cells are discussed.\n",
      "Copper-induced activation of aortic lysyl oxidase in vivo. Raising day-old chicks on diets lacking copper severely depressed the activity of lysyl oxidase, a copper metalloenzyme in connective tissue. Administration of CuSO4 either through the diet or through intraperitoneal injections restored the lysyl oxidase activity in aortic tissue. Two hours after the chicks received CuSO4 (1 mg/kg) the activity of lysyl oxidase rose rapidly to attain, within 4-6 hr, a new steady-state level which was five to 20 times higher than the basal (saline-injected) activity. Twenty hours after copper administration, activity was still higher, in some experiments double that achieved at 6 hr. Very low amounts of cycloheximide injected intraperitoneally 45 min before and 3 hr after copper suppressed the activation response by two-thirds. Cycloheximide given 2 or 4 hr after the copper was only one-half as effective. Actinomycin D caused only a 10-15% inhibition of the copper-induced activation. The data suggest that copper is a key regulator of lysyl oxidase activity in aorta and may in fact be a major determinant of the steady-state levels of the enzyme in that tissue.\n",
      "Evidence that acyl coenzyme A synthetase activity is required for repression of yeast acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase by exogenous fatty acids. The cellular content of acetyl-CoA carboxylase [acetyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.4.1.2] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is reduced by the addition of long-chain fatty acids to the culture medium. Mutant strains of S. cerevisiae defective in acyl-CoA synthetase [acid:CoA ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6.2.1.3] were isolated and used to determine whether fatty acid itself or a metabolite of fatty acid is more directly responsible for the repression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Cells of the mutant strains were capable of incorporating fatty acid to an extent comparable to that observed with the wild-type strain, but they accumulated markedly more of the incorporated fatty acid in the nonesterified form than did the wild-type cells. The level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in the mutants, in contrast to that in the wild-type strain, was hardly affected by the addition of fatty acids to the medium. These results indicate that the activation of exogenous fatty acid is required for the repression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, supporting the view that the repressive effect is mediated by some compound metabolically derived from fatty acid.\n",
      "Glutathione and gamma-glutamyl cycle enzymes in crypt and villus tip cells of rat jejunal mucosa. Villus tip cells and crypt cells of rat jejunal mucosa were separated by the planning procedure of Imondi et al. and were studied with respect to their activities of the enzymes of the gamma-glutamyl cycle and glutathione content. The villus tip cells exhibit much higher gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities than do the crypt cells: thus, gamma-glutamyl trnaspeptidase appears to be a villus-specific enzyme. gamma-Glutamyl cyclotransferase and the enzymes required for glutathione synthesis are not specifically localized to either the crypt or villus tip cells but are present in both. The crypt cells have a high concentration of glutathione (4-5 mM) comparable to the levels found in liver and kidney; in contrast, the villus tip cells have much lower concentrations. On fasting, the glutathione concentration decreased markedly in both villus tip and crypt cells; feeding of protein, but not of sucrose, led to increased glutathione concentrations. The migration of cells from the undifferentiated crypt cell region to the villus tip is associated with structural and biochemical changes that equip the cell for its mature functional activities, which include transport. The present findings indicate that such cellular differentiation and migration is associated with a marked increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity and in the utilization of glutathione.\n",
      "Maturation of neuroblastoma cells in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. Addition of dimethylsulfoxide at concentrations of 1% and 2% (vol/vol) to cells of mouse neuroblastoma clone NIE-115 in the confluent phase of growth resulted in the production of morphologically differentiated cultures with extensive process formation. Cell maintained in 2% dimethylsulfoxide remained in a stable nondividing condition for periods of up to 4 weeks. A high degree of electrical excitability was found in these cells, but there was no clear correlation of this property with the level of induction of either acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine hydrolase; EC 3.1.1.7) or tyrosine hydroxylase [L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating); EC 1.14.16.2]. In addition, intracellular levels of cyclic 3':5'-AMP were not elevated in fully morphologically and electrically differentiated cells. While cell division was markedly inhibited by 2% or higher concentrations of dimethylsulfoxide, at 1% growth continued at a somewhat slowed rate and such cultures exhibited enhanced process formation and electrical activity for a relatively short period. High concentrations (3% or 4%) of dimethylsulfoxide totally suppressed process formation and did not result in increased excitability, but cells maintained high resting potentials. The results suggest that the development of the excitable membrane in neuroblastoma cells may be expressed independently of neurospecific enzyme induction, and does not require a sustained elevation of cyclic 3':5'-AMP levels.\n",
      "Properties of a toxin from the sea anemone Stoichacis helianthus, including specific binding to sphingomyelin. Stoichactis helianthus toxin, a protein derived presumably from the nematocysts, was purified to homogeneity. It has a molecular weight of about 16,000, an isoelectric pH of 9.8, and it contains approximately 3.7% carbohydrate. It is powerfully hemolytic for erythrocytes derived from a variety of animal species, those of the cat being the most sensitive and those of the guinea pig the most resistant. The toxin is lytic also for rabbit blood platelets, and it destroys cultured fibroblasts but is inactive for several kinds of bacterial protoplasts and spheroplasts. The hemolytic activity is specifically inhibited by sphingomyelin, and it is proposed that this phospholipid is the constituent of the membrane which functions as receptor for the toxin. Supporting evidence includes the findings that enzymes known to destroy sphingomyelin (a) prevent erythrocyte membranes from inhibiting hemolysis, and (b) render erythrocytes resistant to lysis by the toxin. The mechanism underlying hemolysis may involve translocation of membrane sphingomyelin by virtue of a specific affinity of the coelenterate protein for this phospholipid.\n",
      "Mechanistic studies of glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli: kinetic evidence for two reaction intermediates in biosynthetic reaction. Fast reaction techniques were used to study the kinetics of protein fluorescence intensity changes that are associated with the reactions of unadenylylated Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase [L-glutamate: ammonia ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.3.1.2] with its substrates. It was established that the synthesis of glutamine occurs by a stepwise mechanism. During the catalytic process two fluorometrically distinct intermediates were observed. Both forward and reverse rate constants which lead to the formation and consumption of these intermediates were evaluated. The catalytic rate constant, kc, which was calculated from these rate constants agrees well with the values of kc which were determined by direct measurement of the overall biosynthetic activities by means of stopped-flow technique or the steady-state assay method.\n",
      "Molecular mechanism of inhibition of firefly luminescence by local anesthetics. The kinetics of the action of local anesthetics upon firefly luciferin and luciferase systems is presented. Clinical concentrations of local anesthetics inhibited this ATP-induced luminescence in a dose-dependent manner. From the effects of temperature and pH upon the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics, it is concluded that hydrophobic ligand-enzyme interaction is the predominant cause of the inhibition, but hydrophilic interaction also contributes to the inhibition to a lesser degree. A molecular theory of anesthesia is outlined which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to the protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of the decreased luminescence. A similar mechanism is expected to occur at the cell membrane, which probably dehydrates the sodium channel and suppresses the conductance of this ion across the membrane. These events lead to a volume expansion of the total system, and the system becomes reactive to a pressure which reverses the anesthesia by shifting the equilibrium to the nonanesthetized original volume. The pressure antagonism of anesthesia can be explained by this overall volume expansion and not by a mere swelling of the cell membrane.\n",
      "Cyclic nucleotide metabolism in compensatory renal hypertrophy and neonatal kidney growth. Cyclic nucleotide metabolism was investigated in growing kidneys of rats during compensatory hypertrophy and during neonatal development. After unilateral nephrectomy a mild and short-lasting decrease in cyclic 3':5\" adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was observed in the hypertrophying kidney. In contrast, cyclic 3':5' guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) showed a sharp decline to 20% of control at 15 min and a rapid rise to 200-300% above base-line at 1-72 hr. The alterations in renal tissue levels of cGMP were associated with parallel changes in the soluble, 100,000 X g supernatant guanylate cyclase activity [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing): EC 4.6.1.2]. No change was observed in total cGMP phosphodiesterase (3':5'-cyclic-nucleotide 5'-nucleotidohydrolase; EC 3.1.4.17). In the rapidly growing kidney of newborn rats cAMP levels were 983 +/- 65 and 833 +/- 42 pmol/g of kidney at 4 and 7 days after birth, and increased to adult levels (1518 +/- 57 pmol/g) at 21 days whereas cGMP levels were 59.8 +/- 6.8 and 92.5 +/- 13.9 pmol/g at 4 and 7 days and decreased to adult levels (36 +/- 1.5) at 21 days. The results indicate that compensatory renal hypertrophy and neonatal kidney growth are associated with changes in cAMP and cGMP metabolism.\n",
      "Effects of denaturants on the sweet-tasting protein monellin. Effects of the denaturants urea and guanidine-HCl on the sweet-tasting protein monellin have been studied. The pH at which monellin is initially treated with denaturant is an important factor in retention of sweetness, but the pH maintained during subsequent removal of denaturant by dialysis has no effect on activity. Recovery of sweetness of denaturant-treated monellin is favored when denaturation occurs at acid pH. Monellin treated with either 6 M guanidine-HCl or 8 M urea at acid pH retains all of its sweetness following removal of denaturant, but urea treatment at neutral pH leads to some irreversible loss of sweetness. Monellin precipitates from solution under some conditions during removal of denaturant by dialysis, and the precipitated protein is no longer sweet. Precipitation is least under acid conditions. Aggregated protein was demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography. The single sulfhydryl group of monellin was not demonstrable in the precipitated protein, having apparently become oxidized during denaturation and formation of the aggregated protein. The data support the hypothesis that the tertiary structure is important in the ability of monellin to elicit a sweet sensation.\n",
      "Thyroxine deiodination associated with NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation in a submicrosomal system. A lipoprotein present in trypsin-treated microsomes can be oxidized with formation of malondialdehyde in a system which contains NADPH, ferric ion-ADP complex, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and a factor. This factor, a mixture of peptides, can be isolated from hepatic microsomes by trypsin digestion and successive gel filtration through Sephadex G-100 and G-25 columns. Lipid peroxidation in this system catalyzes the deiodination of thyroxine, as does NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation in fresh hepatic microsomes. Thyroxine inhibits lipid peroxidation as it is deiodinated in this system.\n",
      "Effect of environmental pH on adenovirus-associated virus. The influence of environmental pH on AAV was studied in infectious virus titrations, induction of CF antigens production of infectious virus, induction of immunofluorescent stainable antigen, and aggregation of the viral particles. The pH of the medium was found to influence the titer of virus stocks in that less virus was registered at acid pH's, giving differences of up to 105 TCID50 in HEK and HEp-2 cells. Less infectious virus was produced in KB cells, and decreased amounts of CF antigen appeared at acid pH's. However, increased levels of detectable intracellular FA antigen appeared at acid pH's. Electron microscopic examination of AAV particles negatively stained at various pH's showed increasingly large aggregates of particles as the pH was lowered. Under the acid conditions studied, the adenovirus helper and cell activities were only slightly suppressed, with the greatest effect due to aggregation of the virus particles.\n",
      "The effect of dexamethasone on urinary acidification. Although it is well recognized that mineralocorticoids enhance renal acid excretion, the effect of glucocorticoids on renal acidification is unclear. Oral administration of dexamethasone to six healthy volunteers for 1 week at a daily dose of 4.5 mg was associated with mild respiratory alkalosis and a small but statistically significant increase in baseline urine pH. However, neither the ability to lower urine pH nor to excrete titratable acid and ammonium after NH4Cl acid-loading was altered. Administration of a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (7.5 mg) was associated with a significant rise in urine pH and potassium excretion and decreased titratable acid, ammonium , and phosphorus excretion in the absence of changes in blood acid-base status, creatinine clearance, or urine flow.\n",
      "A rapid method for measuring guanylate cyclase activity in mammary tissue. A simple and rapid method for measuring guanylate cyclase activity in broken cell preparations of biological tissues is described. This method employs the rate of conversion of [32P]GTP to [32P]cyclic-GMP. The product of this reaction is isolated by ion-exchange chromatography and by a ZnSO4-Ba(OH)2 precipitation at pH 5.7. Using this method, about 30-50 samples can be assayed for guanylate cyclase activity during a 5-6 hr period. The characteristics of this enzyme in the mammary gland were found to be similar to those described for other tissues using different methods for measuring guanylate cyclase activity.\n",
      "Guanylate cyclase and cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase activities in mammary glands of mice during pregnancy and lactation. Guanylate cyclase and cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase activities were measured in homogenates of mammary glands from virgin, pregnant, and lactating mice. Guanylate cyclase activities increased 35% in mammary tissues during pregnancy, and a further 40% increase was observed during lactation. Cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase activity also increased during pregnancy but activities were not different in glands from lactating mice vs glands from pregnant mice. These results are discussed with regard to a possible role of cyclic-GMP in regulating lactational processes.\n",
      "Cyclic-AMP and pancreatic bicarbonate secretion in response to secretin in dogs. In anesthetized dogs given secretin intravenously in doses doubling every 60 min and ranging from 0.5 to 8 units per kg body weight per hr, cyclic-AMP levels in pancreatic tissue rose continuously, whereas DNA concentrations were slightly decreased. Bicarbonate concentrations and bicarbonate outputs, cyclic-AMP tissue concentrations and bicarbonate outputs, as well as cyclic-AMP tissue concentrations and juice outputs, were significantly correlated. In conscious pancreatic fistula dogs, there was also a significant correlation between cyclic-AMP and bicarbonate concentrations and outputs in the pancreatic juice after stimulation by exogenous secretin. Accordingly, enhanced release of endogenous secretin achieved by intraduodenal acidification led to a dose-dependent increase in bicarbonate and cyclic-AMP outputs in both conscious and anesthetized dogs. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (aminophylline, caffeine, and papaverine) given alone to the conscious dogs did not initiate pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, but they potentiated bicarbonate responses to exogenous secretin. These data suggest that cyclic-AMP plays a part in secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion.\n",
      "Effects in the rat of intradermal injection of purified proteinases from streptococcus and Serratia marcescens. Purified streptococcal proteinase and Serratia proteinase are potent permeability factors in rat skin and initiate histopathological evidence of an acute inflammatory response.

      "Comparison of beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of sotalol, oxprenolol, propranolol and pindolol on rabbit intestinal smooth muscle. Adrenergic agonists produced a characteristic and definite decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions and tone of the isolated rabbit jejunum. Effect of phenylephrine was abolished either by phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine. Relaxation induced by epinephrine and by norepinephrine was inhibited after combined treatment with phentolamine and propranolol. Phentolamine alone diminished the response to epinephrine and to norepinephrine, but the diminution for epinephrine was greater, indicating that epinephrine has a greater affinity for alpha- than for beta-receptors in the rabbit jejunum. Stimulation of the beta-receptors by isoproterenol was inhibited by propranolol, oxprenolol, sotalol and pindolol, but the block was incomplete. The activity of these four beta-blockers in preventing the inhibitory response to isoproterenol was as follows: inidolol greater than or equal to oxprenolol greater than propranolol greater than sotalol. This demonstrates the fact that not all beta-adrenergic blocking agents possess an identical pharmacologic spectrum of activity. Also it can be suggested that the beta-receptors of jejunum differ in specificity from those of other organs.\n",
      "Effect of recurrent stress on postnatal increase of tyrosine hydroxylase. Tyrosine hydroxylase is present at birth and reaches adult levels in the hypothalamus usually during the second month. Recurrent stimulation of intrahypothalamic noradrenergic structures shortened this period of maturation in a statistically significant manner.\n",
      "The antinicotinic effects of drugs with clinically useful sedative-antianxiety properties. Mice were given a drug per os and 2 h later were challenged with an intravenous LD95 of nicotine. Amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, meprobamate, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, trifluoroperazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, phenobarbital, propranolol and diphenylhydantoin were all active in protecting mice from extensor convulsions and lethality. Iproniazid, tranylcypromine, atropine, benztropine and trimethadione were inactive. There appears to be a relationship between blockage of nicotine-induced extensor convulsions and lethality in mice and sedative-antianxiety effects in man. This relationship is especially good for drugs designated antidepressant, antianxiety and antipsychotic.\n",
      "Effect of propranolol on antinociceptive and withdrawal characteristics of morphine. Propranolol at a dose (10 mg/kg) which did not alter tail-flick latency by itself, did not alter the ED50 of morphine when given 10 min prior to the narcotic. Propranolol at doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg given 10 min prior to naloxone challenge did not significantly alter the frequency of naloxone induced jumping 72 hr after morphine pellet implantation. The ED50 of naloxone in morphine pelleted mice was not altered by treatment with propranolol at 0, 24, and 48 hr after pellet implantation. Naloxone caused hyperactivity in mice when administered 72 hr after morphine pellet implantation. An injection of 25 mg/kg propranolol 10 min prior to naloxone did not block this hyperactivity. In addition, administration of 10 mg/kg of propranolol every 8 hr to rats during withdrawal from morphine failed to alleviate the withdrawal syndrome as evidenced by changes in either body weight or water intake. These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, does not alter the antinociceptive activity or lessen the withdrawal syndrome of morphine in rodents.\n",
      "Increased acquisition of a complex appetitive task after MSH and MIF. After daily injections of melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), MSH-release inhibiting factor (MIF), or diluent albino rats ran a 12 choice Warden maze for a palatable food reward. Rats receiving the hormones had shorter latencies and made fewer errors than controls during learning but, unlike results with simple tasks, there were no differences during extinction. The results demonstrated that both MSH and MIF-I could facilitate the acquisition of an appetitive task which seemed of sufficient complexity to emphasize differences in performance.\n",
      "The jumping mechanism of Xenopsylla cheopis. I. Exoskeletal structures and musculature. The jumping apparatus of the flea, which includes highly modified direct and indirect flight muscles, is described: attention is drawn to the various specializations of the exoskeleton which stiffen the thorax and also provide the 'click' mechanism triggering take-off. A finger-like invagination of tall cells within the cavity of the developing pleural arch of the pharate adult secretes the resilin pad. This is illustrated with coloured photographs. It is suggested that winglessness of a Mecopteran-like ancestor pre-adapted fleas to a parasitic life-style, and that a jumping mode of progression was a primitive feature of the whole Order. Scattered throughout the Siphonaptera today are species which have secondarily lost the pleural arch and with it the power to execute large jumps. These are usually found among fleas parasitizing mammals inhabiting caves, subterranean burrows and runs, high aerial nests and snow or ice-bound habitats. Large pleural arches are associated with fleas infesting large mobile hosts.\n",
      "The jumping mechanism of Xenopsylla cheopis. II. The fine structure of the jumping muscle. The ultrastructure of the trochanteral depressor muscle of the oriental rat flea is described. It is shown to be similar to that of the tubular leg muscles of other insects except in the volume and arrangement of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The sarcoplasmic reticulum occupies approximately 18% of the volume of the muscle fibres. It is in three configurations:a regular array of parallel tubules opposite the A-band, a collar of sacculi involved in the formation of the dyads at the edge of the A-band and a loosely woven arrangement of tubules around the I-band. This tripartite arrangement of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and its large surface area is discussed in relation to the action of the muscle as the main propulsive muscle in the jump of the flea.\n",
      "The jumping mechanism of Xenopsylla cheopis. III. Execution of the jump and activity. The flea's hind legs are the chief source of jumping power, but in species which execute large jumps, take-off is accelerated by elastic energy released from a resilin pad (homologous with the wing hinge ligaments of flying insects) situated in the pleural arch. A central click mechanism, operated by a rapid twitch of the trochanteral depressor (the starter muscle), synchronizes the separate sources of energy which power the jump. Ciné photos confirm the morphological evidence that the flea takes off from the trochanters, not the tarsi. The loss of wings, associated with lateral compression of the body and the shortening of the pleural ridge (which thus lowers the position of the pleural arch) together with modifications of the direct and indirect flight muscles, are some of the main morphological features associated with the change from a flying to a saltatorial mode of progression. The flea's take-off basically resembles that of other Panorpoid insects (Diptera, Mecoptera, etc.). The release of elastic energy from the pleural arch is a system by which the force used to move the wings of flying insects is rapidly fed back into the legs and adds power to the jump.\n",
      "Self-assembly of biological macromolecules. The genetic apparatus of the cell is responsible for the accurate biosynthesis of the primary structure of macromolecules which then spontaneously fold up and, in certain circumstances, aggregate to yield the complex tertiary and quaternary structures of the biologically active molecules. Structures capable of self-assembly in this range from simple monomers through oligomers to complex multimeric structures that may contain more than one type of polypeptide chain and components other than protein. It is becoming clear that even with the simpler monomeric enzymes there is becoming clear that even with the simpler monomeric enzymes there is a kinetically determined pathway for the folding process and that a folded protein must now be regarded as the minimum free energy form of the kinetically accessible conformations. It is argued that the denatured subunits of oligomeric enzymes are likely to fold to something like their final structure before aggregating to give the native quaternary structure and the available evidence would suggest that this is so. The importance of nucleation events and stable intermediates in the self-assembly of more complex structures is clear. Many self-assembling structures contain only identical subunits and symmetry arguments are very successful in accounting for the structures formed. Because proteins are themselves complex molecules and not inelastic geometric objects, the rules of strict symmetry can be bent and quasi-equivalent bonding between subunits permitted. This possibility is frequently employed in biological structures. Conversely, symmetry arguments can offer a reliable means of choosing between alternative models for a given structure. It can be seen that proteins gain stability by growing larger and it is argued in evolutionary terms that aggregation of subunits is the preferred way to increase the size of proteins. The possession of quaternary structure by enzymes allows conferral of other biologically important properties, such as cooperativity between active sites, changes of specificity, substrate channelling and sequential reactions within a multi-enzyme complex. Comparison is made of the invariant subunit compositions of the simpler oligomeric enzymes with the variation evidently open to, say, the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes of E. coli. With viruses, on the other hand, the function of the quaternary structure is to package nucleic acid and, as an example, the assembly and breakdown of tobacco mosaic virus is discussed. Attention is drawn to the possible ways in which the principles of self-assembly can be extended to make structures more complicated than those that can be formed by simple aggregation of the comonent parts.\n",
      "Dynamic aspects of enzyme specificity. There are two aspects of enzyme specificity: recognition of the substrate by the formation of an enzyme-substrate compound and recognition of the transition state by catalysis of the reaction. Kinetic studies with inactive substrate analogues as potential competitive inhibitors, and structural studies of their compounds with enzymes, give information about the first of these specificity elements. Comparative kinetic studies with alternative substrates give information about both. There is a great deal of information from kinetic studies of dehydrogenases about the coenzyme specificities, substrate specificities and stereospecificities and mechanisms of these enzymes, particularly alcohol dehydrogenases. Recent X-ray diffraction studies of dehydrogenases have given insight into the molecular basis of some of their specificity elements. An attempt is made to correlate the available kinetic and structural data for alcohol and lactate dehydrogenases.\n",
      "Water structure and hydration. Possible structures adopted by bulk water are discussed with special reference to the possible presence of monomeric water and the detection of 'free' -OH groups. The way in which water tends to accommodate small hydrophobic molecules is considered, with particular reference to the clathrate theory and the phenomenon of 'structure making'. Cage-pairing and cage-sharing processes are described. Consideration of the way water solvates cations and anions is followed by a discussion of the way these solvated ions interact with the bulk medium. Large symmetrical alkylammonium ions probably encourage clathrate cage formation, at least at low temperatures. Particular reference is made to the use of infrared, Raman, ultraviolet, n.m.r. and e.s.r. spectroscopic techniques to the study of water and aqueous solutions.\n",

The intercalative trypanosomal drug, ethidium bromide, forms a crystalline complex with the dinucleoside monophosphate, 5-iodiuridylyl(3'-5')adenosine (iodoUpA). These crystals are monoclinic, space group C2, with unit cell dimensions, a = 2.845 nm, b = 1.354 nm, c = 3.413 nm, beta = 98.6 degrees. The structure has been solved to atomic resolution by Patterson and Fourier methods, and refined by full matrix least squares to a residual of 0.29 on 2017 observed reflexions. The asymmetric unit contains two ethidium molecules, two iodoUpA molecules, twenty water molecules and four methanol molecules, a total of 156 atims excluding hydrogens. The two iodoUpA molecules are held together by adenine-uracil Watson-Crick base-pairing. Adjacent base-pairs within this paired iodoUpA structure and between neighbouring iodoUpA molecules in adjoining unit cells  are separated by 0.68 nm. This separation results from intercalative binding by one ethidium molecule and stacking by the other symmetry is utilized in this model drub-nucleic acid interaction, the intercalative ethidium molecule being oriented such that its phenyl and ethyl groups lie in the narrow groove of the miniature nucleic acid double helix. Solution studies have indicated a marked sequence specificity for ethidium-dinucleotide interactions and a probable structural explanation for this has been provided by this study.\n",
      "DNA-RNA hybridization. Interest in nucleic acid hybridization stems mainly from its great power as a tool in biological research. It is used in several quite distinct ways. Because of the high degree of specificity that they show, hybridization techniques can be used to measure the amount of one specific sequence within a very heterogeneous mixture of sequences. Measurements of 1/10(6)-10(7) have been recorded. In extension of this, various properties of a specific sequence can often be studied. Secondly, because the kinetics of nucleic acid hybridization are quite well understood, it can be used to characterize both a pure sequence and a very complex mixture of sequences, like the genome of a vertebrate. Thirdly, again because of its specificity, it can be used to measure homologies between different populations of nucleic acids. Lastly, in conjunction with other techniques, it can be used as a basis for the fractionation of nucleic acid populations and the purification of specific sequences. Specific examples of these applications are given, with special reference to the organization of the genome in higher eukaryotes.\n",
      "The dynamic properties of biological membranes. Biological membranes must be viewed as highly dynamic, undergoing continuous structural fluctuations and changes in response to external perturbations. The study of liposomes by 31 P n.m.r. and fluorescence can reveal some of the motional characteristics of the different regions in a bilayer. Asymmetric lipid distribution and how this depends on the environment is also observed by n.m.r. The nature of the interaction of amine anaesthetics and of polypeptide antibodies with membranes is discussed in relation to their perturbing effect. The role of lipid mobility in modulating hormone-receptor interaction is discussed with reference to the binding of thyroid stimulating hormone.\n",
      "Recognition at cell surfaces: phytohaemagglutinin-lymphocyte interaction. Many aspects of cell behaviour are regulated by the interaction of extracellular ligands with specific receptors exposed on the cell surface. The receptors correspond to membrane proteins and expecially glycoproteins. A key event in regulation is the transmission across the surface membrane of the information resulting from receptor-ligand interaction. The activation of lymphocytes by Phaseolus vulgaris phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) provides a convenient experimental model for the study of the molecular basis of receptor-ligand interaction and the molecular consequences of interaction. The receptor mediating lymphocyte activation by PHA is probably a unique glycoprotein which is present to the extent of about 3 X 10(4) molecules/cell. The PHA-receptor complex solubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate has a molecular size of about 3 X 10(5). The primary event in the activation process is probably an increase in the permeability of the surface membrane to Ca2+. This may be achieved by PHA cross-linking ('patching') the receptors to form a polar channel that permits an influx of Ca2+.\n",
      "Cell communication by periodic cyclic-AMP pulses. At the surface of aggregating cells of the slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum, two different sites interacting with extracellular cAMP are detectable: binding sites and cycl-nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Both sites are developmentally regulated. An adequate stimulus for the chemoreceptor system in D. discoideum is the change of cAMP concentration in time, rather than concentration per se: long-term binding of cAMP causes only short-term response. The system is, consequently, adapted to the recognition of pulses rather than to steady-state concentrations of cAMP. The ce,lls are, nevertheless, able to sense stationary spatial gradients and to respond to them by chemotactic orientation. The possibility is discussed that they do so by transforming spatial concentration changes into temporal ones, using extending pseudopods as sensors. The cAMP recognition system is part of a molecular network involved in the generation of spatio-temporal patterns of cellular activities. This system controls the periodic formation of chemotactic signals and their propagation from cell to cell. The phosphodiesterase limits the duration of the cAMP pulses and thus sharply separates the periods of signalling; the binding sites at the cell surface are supposed to be the chemoreceptors. The control of cellular activities via cAMP receptors can be studied with biochemical techniques with cell suspensions in which spatial inhomogeneities are suppressed by intense stirring, whereas the temporal aspect of the spatiotemporal pattern is preserved. Under these conditions it can be shown that the extracellular cAMP concentration changes periodically, and that the phase of the cellular oscillator can be shifted by external pulses of cAMP. It can also be shown that small cAMP pulses induce a high output of cAMP, which demonstrates signal amplification, a function necessary for a cellular relay system.\n",
      "Recognition of metal cations by biological systems. Recognition of metal cations by biological systems can be compared with the geochemical criteria for isomorphous replacement. Biological systems are more highly selective and much more rapid. Methods of maintaining an optimum concentration, including storage and transfer for the essential trace elements, copper and iron, used in some organisms are in part reproducible by coordination chemists while other features have not been reporduced in models. Poisoning can result from a foreign metal taking part in a reaction irreversibly so that the recognition site or molecule is not released. For major nutrients, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, there are similarities to the trace metals in selective uptake but differences qualitatively and quantitatively in biological activity. Compounds selective for potassium replace all the solvation sphere with a symmetrical arrangement of oxygen atoms; those selective for sodium give an asymmetrical environment with retention of a solvent molecule. Experiments with naturally occurring antibiotics and synthetic model compounds have shown that flexibility is an important feature of selectivity and that for transfer or carrier properties there is an optimum (as opposed to a maximum) metal-ligand stability constant. Thallium is taken up instead of potassium and will activate some enzymes; it is suggested that the poisonous characteristics arise because the thallium ion may bind more strongly than potassium to part of a site and then fail to bind additional atoms as required for the biological activity. Criteria for the design of selective complexing agents are given with indications of those which might transfer more than one metal at once.\n",
      "Structure and specificity of antibody molecules. The structure of the Fab' fragment of a human myeloma protein (IgG1 (lambda) New) has been determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis to a nominal resolution of 0.2 nm. Each of the structure subunits corresponding to the variable and to the constant homology regions of the light and heavy polypeptide chains contains two irregular beta-sheets which are roughly parallel to each other and surround a tighly packed interior of hydrophobic side chains. The regions of the hypervariable sequences in the light and heavy chains occur in close spatial proximity at one end of the molecule, defining the active site of IgG New. The role of these hypervariable regions in defining the size and shape of the active site of different immunoglobulins is discussed on the basis of the three-dimensional model of Fab' New. Several ligands that bind to the active centre of IgG New have been used to obtain crystalline ligand-Fab' New complexes which were investigated by difference Fourier maps. These studies are analysed in terms of the biological function and specificity of antibodies.\n",
      "Intermolecular forces. The nature of molecular interactions is examined. Intermolecular forces are divided into long-range and short-range components; the former operate at distances where the effects of electron exchange are negligible and decrease as an inverse power of the separation. The long-range interactions may be subdividied into electrostatic, induction and dispersion contributions, where the electrostatic component is the interaction of the permanent charge distributions and the others originate in the fluctuations in the distributions. Typical magnitudes of the various contributions are given. The forces between macroscopic bodies are briefly considered, as are the effects of a medium. Some of the manifestations of molecular interactions are discussed.\n",
      "Antibody--hapten interactions in solution. This paper reports the initial progress in a research programme to identify and obtain the relative orientations, in solution, of the amino acid residues that constitute the combining site of the myeloma protein MOPC 315. This protein has a molecular mass of 150,000, but enzymic digestion yields the Fv fragment of molecular mass 25,000 which still has the combining site intact, as judged by the affinity for dinitrophenyl haptens. Analysis of the e.s.r. spectra of a series of dinitrophenyl spin labelled haptens has allowed the dimensions, rigidity and polarity profile of the combining site to be determined. The combining site is a cleft of overall dimensions 1.1 nm x 0.9 nm x 0.6 nm which has considerable structural rigidity. One of these spin labels has also been used to perturb the n.m.r. spectrum of the Fv and using difference spectroscopy the 270 MHz proton n.m.r. spectrum of the amino acid residues in and around the combining site has been obtained. This spectrum contains only the equivalent of about 30 aromatic and 21 aliphatic protons. Comparison of this difference spectrum with that obtained using a diamagnetic analogue suggests that any conformational changes on hapten binding are mainly localized to the combining site. By the use of (n.m.r.) difference spectroscopy the protons of the three histidine residues in the Fv are observed to titrate with pH and have pKa values of about 8.1, 6.9 and 6.1. The histidine resonances with pKa values 6.9 and 6.1 alter slightly in the presence of haptens and also appear in the spin label difference spectrum, and must therefore be in or near to the combining site. These are assigned to His 102H and His 97L. The existence of lanthanide binding sites on the Fv, necessary for the mapping studies, has been demonstrated by measurements of Gd III water relaxation rates in Fv solutions and also by the changes in the Fv tryptophan fluorescence on addition of Gd III. At pH 5.5 there is one tight binding site for the lanthanides (KD approximately 80 muM) but in the presence of hapten this is weakened 10-20 fold with a reciprocal effect on the hapten binding. Measurements of the Gd III quenching of the e.s.r. spectrum of a spin labelled hapten bound to Fv indicate that the lanthanide site is ca. 1.5 nm from the nitroxide moiety.\n",
      "Molecule--receptor specificity. The specificity of binding between small molecules and macromolecular receptors may be studied by comparing theoretically calculated conformational potential energy surfaces of a series of chemically similar molecules which have a range of receptor binding energies and biological activities. In this way essential requirements for binding may be highlighted, including the necessity of the small molecule adopting, or passing through, conformations which are not at energy minima and not found either in the solid state or in aqueous solution. In particular the conformational demands of the adrenergic beta-receptor and histamine H1 receptor are considered.\n",
      "Enzyme substrate and inhibitor interactions. An enzyme is designed to bind most tightly to a substrate when it is in the transition state of the reaction which the enzyme catalyses. The consequent reduction of the activation energy of the reaction constitutes the catalytic mechanism. The energetic contributions of different features of the interaction can only be crudely assessed, but they are dominated by entropically driven effects. The binding site of trypsin orients the substrate so that the reacting groups are correctly placed for reaction to occur. Apart from two side chains which take part in chemical steps of the reaction, the enzyme behaves almost as a rigid body. The full binding interactions are only developed when the substrate is in an intermediate stage of the reaction. The tightly bound complexes of trypsin with protein trypsin inhibitors have proved amenable to structural analysis. Enzyme inhibitor interactions, which account for almost 80 kJ mol-1 of interaction energy, are known fairly accurately. The similarity of the two known trypsin inhibitor structures, close to the primary binding site, indicates a high specificity, even for this simple interaction. In cases where no large conformational changes occur the specificity of an enzyme should be predictable from accurate knowledge of its tertiary structure.\n",
      "The thermal transition of brain soluble proteins. Soluble rat brain proteins undergo a thermal reversible denaturation in the range of 20 degrees C -65 degrees C. The thermal transition as studied in 0.25 M sucrose solution, is associated with changes in the proteins ionization capacity by the lowering of the isoionic solution pHfrom a value of 6.95 at 20 degrees C to 6.55 at 65 degrees C. The apparent enthalpy change delta H at the transition temperature (t=50 degrees C) is about 34 Kcal, heat capacity delta Cp about 1.75 Kcal, and apparent entrophy change deltaS 100 e.u. The data suggest that the thermal transition is predominantly a two-state process. A prolonged keeping of the protein solution at the increased temperature produces a partial reversibility of thermal transitions by a lowering of 5-HT cations fixing on the protein molecule.\n",
      "Attenuation of the euphoriant and activating effects of d- and l-amphetamine by lithium carbonate treatment. Seven of nine depressed patients experienced a 4.3-fold increase in rated euphoria and activation following 30 mg d-amphetamine in a replicated dose, double blind study. d-Amphetamine was 2 to 2.3-fold more effective in producing activation, euphoria, and antidepressant effects than the same dose of l-amphetamine. Co-treatment with lithium carbonate produced a 60% (P less than 0.001) attenuation of the activation and euphoria responses to d-amphetamine. The responses to l-amphetamine were almost completely abolished by lithium. This study raises the possibility of lithium carbonate use as an adjunct in the treatment of amphetamine addiction.\n",
      "Some metabolic approaches to improving myocardial performance during cardiac hypoxia. Four possible metabolic approaches to improving cardiac function in the presence of myocardial hypoxia have been considered. 1. It appears that there is increasing evidence which suggests that free fatty acids are harmful to the ischemic heart. 2. Although it has been demonstrated that Krebs cycle intermediates can result in anaerobic energy formation by the mitochondria, and under certain extreme conditions can lead to improved performance of the heart, the potential for a physiologically important effect of this approach is probably limited. 3. The protection of the ischemic or hypoxic heart by alkalosis may be a feasible approach. The major beneficial effect appears to be exerted through more efficient conversion of energy that is already available to contractile performance rather than by increasing energy supply. 4. There appears to be some real potential for improving cardiac energy delivery via the glycolytic pathway. Calculations based on isolated rat heart studies indicate that, at 50% oxygenation, glycolytic ATP generation could totally correct for the deficit in mitochondrial ATP formation. Therefore, it is in the area of overcoming the inhibition of glycolytic ATP formation and tapping this potential metabolic pathway that energy delivery may be restored toward normal in the hypoxic and perhaps the borderline zone of underperfusion in the ischemic heart. The problem of the ischemic inhibition of glycolysis may partially be overcome by creating extracellular alkalosis, but this presumption will have to be tested.\n",
      "Factors influencing tolerance of cardiac muscle to hypoxia. The effects of isoproterenol, glucose, and pH on the responses of isolated rat cardiac muscle to hypoxia (95% N2, 5% CO2) were examined while the muscles were contracting isometrically 12 times a minute at 28 degrees C. In the presence of 5.5 mM glucose, 10(-5) M isoproterenol and alkaline pH (7.8) improved the performance of cardiac muscle during early hypoxia. This was followed by a premature decline in developed tension, and contracture appeared. Recovery of function following reoxygenation with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 after a 60-min period of hypoxia was poor. Acid pH (6.8) resulted in an early decline of mechanical activity during hypoxia; but contracture did not appear, and full recovery of developed tension was seen upon reoxygenation after 60 min of hypoxia. When 22 mM glucose was used as substrate, the early responses to hypoxia were not altered; but late performance was improved, contracture did not appear, and full recovery after 60 min of hypoxia was seen. If additional glucose was added to the bath after 30 min of hypoxia (concentration 22 mM), little effect on developed tension was evident; but contracture diminished and recovery after 60 min of hypoxia was improved. Addition of 22 mM glucose allowed isoproterenol to exert its inotropic effect in the absence of late deleterious changes. The data support the concept that factors tending to increase the utilization of limited stores of anaerobic substrate during hypoxia facilitate deterioration. By increasing exogenous glucose, the support of inotropic activity without late adverse effects appears possible, and recovery is improved upon reoxygenation.\n",
      "Effects of pH and pCO2 on performance of ischemic myocardium. Contractile performance of ischemic feline myocardium was evaluated under conditions of selective changes in perfusate in pH and pCO2. A substantial increase in myocardial performance was noted when the pCO2 was lowered at constant pH, and depression of performance was noted when the pCO2 was increased at constant pH. Perfusate acidosis at constant pCO2 resulted in depression of performance and decreased performance only after 20 min of exposure. Alkalosis did not increase performance and decreased performance transiently during mild ischemia. These studies suggest that performance of myocardium during ischemia is closely related to tissue pCO2 and is minimally related to the level of extracellular pH.\n",
      "Effects of inhalation anesthetics on cardiac function and metabolism in the intact dog. In healthy, closed-chest dogs, dose-dependent depression of ventricular function was produced by the anesthetics halothane, methoxyflurane, and fluroxene, as evidence by decreases in left venticular stroke volume, stroke work, dP/dt, and an increased enddiastolic pressure. Myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption decreased concomitantly and were correlated with aortic blood pressure decreases. There was no change in myocardial lactate extraction with halothane and methoxyflurane, suggesting that myocardial  oxygenation was adequate in spite of the decrease in blood flow. However, even with marked increases in arterial lactate concentration during fluroxene anesthesia, extraction did not chance and, in fact, tended to decrease. The hemodynamic effects of halothane and methoxyflurane are similar to those previously reported in man, but those of fluroxene are different. Consequently, clinical speculation from these results is not justified at this time.\n",
      "Tissue water and pH in experimental primary cardiomyopathy induced by isoproterenol in frog. Acute aneurysms and other morphologically defined cardiac lesions were produced in frogs by isoproterenol (IPR) as previously described. Samples from lesions verified in vivo and from macroscopically normal ventricular areas, together with samples from nontreated control animals, were analyzed for total water content, inulin space, pHe, and pHi by using DMO-14C and inulin-3H. Total cardiac tissue water content was increased in all types of lesions after IPR injection. The highest content was found in bulging, noncontractile aneurysms. Inulin space was enlarged in all heart muscle specimens from IPR-treated animals, including those without macroscopically visible lesions. Those specimens with aneurysms showed the greatest degree of enlargement. The (pHe-pHi) did not differ between injected and noninjected animals, and the noncontractile samples from aneurysms did not differ from other lesions and macroscopically intact areas. In IPR-injected animals, there was no difference in pHi between macroscopically damaged and nondamaged segments of ventricle wall. On comparing these animals to controls, however, a slight shift to the alkaline side for both pHi and pHe was observed. The (pHe-pHi) was higher in skeletal muscle than in heart muscle in both IPR-treated and nontreated animals. Tissue water increased in skeletal muscle after IPR injection, reflecting a change of intracellular water as inulin space was maintained.\n",
      "Normal arterial blood gases during experimental hypertriglyceridemia in the rat. The possible effect of high concentrations of plasma triglycerides on arterial oxygen tension was investigated in rats by infusion of lymph chylomicrons or a soybean oil emulsion (Intralipid). Mean triglyceride concentrations were raised from 130 to 1454 mg/100 ml without statistically significant change in arterial oxygen tension, oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide tension, or pH. The small reduction in arterial oxygen tension, content, or saturation observed in earlier studies may have been due to inadequate stabilization of fat emulsion then available for intravenous use. The present data suggest that high concentrations of plasma triglycerides produced by infusion of chylomicrons or Intralipid do not affect arterial blood gases in the normal rat.\n",
      "Diagnosis of liver diseases by laboratory results and discriminant analysis. Identification of best combinations of laboratory tests. Patients with different liver diseases were studied by discriminant analysis. Groups of patients classified mainly on the basis of liver biopsy findings showed functional differences which permitted a consistent reclassification by discriminant functions using laboratory results. Optimal combinations of laboratory tests for the separation of liver diseases were defined. Different combinations were found, dependent on the subsets of liver diseases studied.\n",
      "Survival of rats subjected to acute anemia at different levels of erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. An experimental procedure was worked out in which rats were subjected to an exchange of erythrocytes, followed by acute anemia by means of hemodilution. One group of rats received erythrocytes with a high concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), and the other group was given erythrocytes with a low DPG concentration. The survival rate was equal in the two groups. Irrespective of DPG concentration, the rats whose hemoglobin concentration reached the lowest level died. The rats that died were also more acidotic than the others. The results indicate that the hemoglobin concentration and the pH value were more important determinants for survival than the DPG concentrations.\n",
      "The influence of bacterial superinfection on the clinical course of influenza. Studies from the influenza epidemics in Stockholm during the winters 1969-70 and 1971-72. During two epidemics of influenza A infection in Stockholm 1969-72, 249 cases were selected for a study on the effect of bacterial superinfection. Bacterial involvement was demonstrated through cultures and serologic reactions. The occurrence of C-reactive protein in increased amount in serum was significantly more common in the group which had the strongest indication of bacterial infection. An increased duration of fever, and a higher incidence of pneumonia, leukocytosis and erythrocyte sedimentation rate over 50 mm/l h was also the rule in cases with bacterial involvement. During both epidemics the bacteria most often involved were pneumococci.\n",
      "Evaluation of the antibiotic effect of treatment of maxillary sinusitis. As the effect of antibiotic treatment of maxillary sinusitis has been questioned, the elimination of bacteria from sinus secretions was studied during antibiotic treatment. Penicillin V, azidocillin, tetracycline or doxycycline was administered to 54 patients with maxillary sinusitis. Samples of sinus secretion were aspirated both before treatment and 2-3 days after the onset of treatment. When the antibiotic concentration was below the upper limit of MIC for sensitivity group 1, bacterial growth was present in practically all samples. When the antibiotic concentration equalled or was above this limit, there was no bacterial growth in about half of the samples. A prerequisite for antibiotic effect--elimination of bacteria--is that the antibiotic concentration is well above the MIC of the bacteria at the site of infection. The choice between bactericidal or bacteriostatic antibiotics appeared unimportant. Bacterial survival in the maxillary sinus despite a high antibiotic concentration in the sinus illustrates that MIC values determined in the laboratory do not always mirror the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics in vivo.\n",
      "Roentgenological findings in cryptorchidism. Intravenous urography of 78 cryptorchid boys revealed no clinically significant upper urinary tract anomalies. Two boys had a rotated kidney and 2 others a double renal pelvis. One boy had previously been operated upon because of hydronephrosis. There thus appears to be no reason for routine intravenous urography of cryptorchid boys. Forty-two per cent of the boys had spina bifida occulta in the lumbar and sacral spine. One case of asymptomatic congenital cardiac disease was discovered at routine chest X-ray.\n",
      "Semen cahracteristics before and after ligation of the left internal spermatic veins in men with varicocele. The semen from 20 men with varicocele was studied before and after surgical correction of the varicocele. The effect on sperm quality was only marginal and could not explain the fairly high conception rate (20%) after operation. The recommendation that varicocele in men with long-term infertility should be eliminated by ligation of the internal spermatic veins is still justified despite the absence of positive effects on sperm quality.\n",
      "Plasma potassium and insulin during extracorporeal circulation using a glucose-containing pump prime. In order to investigate the possible relationship between a glucose-containing pump prime and changes in plasma potassium during extracorporeal circulation, determinations were made of blood glucose and plasma insulin, potassium, and magnesium in 18 subjects undergoing open-heart surgery. In 6 of the patients, the same parameters had been measured during a pre-operative glucose tolerance test. It was found that the elimination of glucose was considerably impaired during extracorporeal circulation, in spite of high insulin levels. During the first minutes of extracorporeal circulation, plasma potassium fell more than during the glucose tolerance test, in spite of comparable insulin levels. It is concluded that changes in plasma potassium during extracorporeal circulation do not reflect insulin activity to any noticeable extent.\n",
      "Construction and evaluation of a simple membrane oxygenator for small organ perfusion. A simple membrane oxygenator for isolated organ perfusion is described. The membrane employed consisted of an ordinary silicone rubber tubing, 2 mm internal diameter, 0.3 mm wall thickness, the length of the tubing varying according to the required gas transfer. When describing the capacity of the oxygenator, it was found that the maximum gas transfer rate per unit membrane surface was an inadequate measure, since this would vary with both flow rate through the oxygenator and the gas binding capacity of the perfusate. The following formula for the function describing the relation between maximally possible change in gas concentration in the perfusate (C), flow rate (F) and actual change in gas concentration in the perfusate (U) was proposed: U=C-e(-bF), b being a constant specific for the gas and the membrane. This formula was tested by a series of in vitro experiments and proved to give a valid description of the capacity of the oxygenator. It was also found that carbon dioxide was always more easily transferred than oxygen, so that oxygen transfer capcity was the limiting factor in the use of the oxygenator. To facilitate the construction of the right size membrane, a nomogram was constructed for oxygen transfer.\n",
      "The influence of arm ischaemia and arm hyperaemia on subclavian and vertebral artery blood flow in patients with occlusive disease of the subclavian artery and the brachiocephalic trunk. A peroperative study. A peroperative study of blood flow and flow direction was performed in series of patients with occlusive disease of the subclavian artery. Particular attention was focused on the flow variations caused by arm ischaemia and postischaemic hyperaemia and on the effect of injection of a vasodilator into the distal subclavian artery. The effect on blood flow and flow direction was measured with the aid of an electromagnetic flowmeter. During arm ischaemia induced by an inflated cuff on the arm, the subclavian flow diminished, as did the vertebral artery flow when it was retrograde. If the vertebral artery flow was anterograde, it increased during arm ischaemia. The postischaemic hyperaemia caused an increase of the subclavian flow and of reversed vertebral flow. If the vertebral flow was anterograde, it diminished during the postischaemic hyperaemia. Similar findings were obtained with intra-arterial injection of a vasodilator. The large amount of blood flow passing through the vertebral artery, as well as the flow variations caused by reactive arm hyperaemia, emphasize the role of this artery as a collateral vessel to the upper limb in cases of the subclavian steal phenomenon.\n",

Infrared spectra of time- and size-classified atmospheric particulate samples collected with a inertial impactor reveal the presence of acid sulfate in the submicrometer-sized fraction.

      "Specific effects of neurotransmitter antagonists on ganglion cells in rabbit retina. Directionally sensitive ganglion cells in rabbit retina lose their directional sensitivity when picrotoxin, an antagonist of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, is infused into the retinal blood supply. Strychnine, an antagonist of glycine, does not produce this effect. Other receptive field types are affected by strychnine but not picrotoxin. Inhibitory transmitters therefore have specific functions in information processing in the retina.\n",

Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was higher in mesenteric vessels, adrenal glands, and serum of 3-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats but lower in the locus coeruleus than it was in the control Wistar-Kyoto rats. The results support the concept that the nervous system is an important regulator of blood pressure.\n",

      "The mechanism of the inhibition of iron absorption by tea. Previous human studies have shown that drinking tea during meals significantly inhibits the absorption of both food iron and medicinal iron. This study provides evidence from experiments with rats that the tannins in the tea are responsible for the inhibition, probably by forming non-absorbable complexes with the iron within the intestinal lumen. The molar ratio of tannin: iron is dependent on the pH, being 1:1 at pH 2,0 2:1 at pH 5,5 and 3:1 at pH 8,0. Since tannins are present in many vegetable foods the formation of such complexes may be a factor in the poor availability for absorption of much food iron.\n",
      "An investigation into the hepatic cytochrome P-450 catalysed metabolism of the anaesthetic fluroxene (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl vinyl ether). The role of the different cytochromes P-450 in the metabolism of the anaesthetic agent fluroxene, and the mechanism of production of toxic effects seen after pre-treatment of the animals with pehnobarbital prior to anaesthesia, have been investigated. Male rats were anaesthetized with fluroxene, or with 2,2,2-trifluroethyl ethyl ether, or with ethyl vinyl ether in an attempt to ascertain the in vivo toxic effects of the three anaesthetic agents. The resultant hepatic histology is reported. A study of the binding and metabolism of fluroxene by isolated rat hepatic microsomes was also made. We conclude that it is elevated levels of cytochrome P-450 which potentiate the toxicity of fluroxene anaesthesia in phenobarbital treated animals and that cytochrome P-448 does not bind or metabolize fluroxene. The potential toxicity of the fluroxene molecule is considered to reside in the trifluoroethyl moiety, while the vinyl group of fluroxene appears to play a role in the observed liver damage.\n",
      "Direct revascularization of acute myocardial infarction by implantation of left internal mammary artery into infarcted left ventricular myocardium. This is a preliminary report. Clearly, the internal mammary artery implanted into the infarcted anterolateral portion of the wall of the left ventricle has been of help in decreasing the size of the infarction and in maintaining the life of the dogs and normal function six hours after a large left ventricular wall myocardial infarction had been created. More animals need to be studied at the end of six hours, eight hours, and ten hours after implantation. More studies are needed to learn if ligation of the coronary veins at the same time as the arteries is beneficial or not. Two internal mammary arteries may act better than one when implanted side by side into a 5 by 5 centimeter infarction. In man, both internal mammary arteries and the right gastroepiploic artery could be used to revascularize acute myocardial infarctions in the posterior and anterolateral parts of the left ventricle.\n",
      "Chronic anemia, wound healing, and red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Relationships between various types of chronic anemia, wound healing, and red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) were examined in rabbits. Wound tensile strength and energy absorption were not affected by chronic iron-deficiency anemia, the chronic hemolytic anemia caused by intravenous water infusion nor by chronic hemolytic anemia caused by intravenous water infusion nor by chronic phenylhydrazine-induced anemia. Red cell 2,3 DPG levels were increased in the anemia of iron deficiency and were normal in the rabbits with chronic phenylhydrazine-induced anemia at the time of wound excision but were low following phynylhydrazine injection. The results show that chronic anemia per se does not affect the tensile strength and energy adsorption of wound healing. The findings suggest that the wound healing process may differ in certain types of anemia.\n",
      "Effects of beta-adrenergic stimulating and blocking agents on the adrenaline response and adenyl cyclase activity of leukocyte in monkey and human being. Using the method in which leukocyte suspensions were incubated with NaF or metaproterenol at 30 degrees C for 15-30 min to allow them to convert 3H-ATP (10 muCi) to 3H-cyclic AMP, followed by separation of the formed 3H-cyclic AMP by common chromatography, the leukocyte adenyl cyclase activity of monkeys and human beings was measured with high reproducibility. The oral administration of metaproterenol increased the leukocyte adenyl cyclase activity which was stimulated by NaF and decreased the count of peripheral eosinophils in some of the monkeys. In the beta-adrenergic blockade of the monkey which was made by administration of propranolol, the leukocyte adenyl cyclase activity significantly decreased. The leukocyte adenyl cyclase from patients with coronary heart disease also decreased after oral medication with propranolol.\n",
      "Human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase B and C in chronic obstructive lung disease. The levels of carbonic anhydrase B and C isozymes in human red cells were determined using a quantitative immunological technique in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. A significant increase in the level of carbonic anhydrase B was observed in these patients, while the level of carbonic anhydrase C did not change substantially. Positive correlations were found between the level of carbonic anhydrase B and arterial CO2 tension and plasma HCO3 concentration. A negative correlation was observed between the levels of carbonic anhydrase B and blood pH. These findings suggest that the synthesis or degradation of carbonic anhydrase B isozyme is affected by arterial CO2 tension or plasma HC03 concentration. The clinical significance was also discussed in relation to these isozyme levels in red cell.\n",
      "Hemodynamic effects of aerosol propellants. II. Pulmonary circulation in the dog. The inhalation of trichlorofluoromethane (FC11), dichlorotetrafluoroethane (FC114) and dichlorodifluoromethane (FC12) caused a reduction in mean aortic blood pressure but only FC11 and FC114 caused a reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. The primary cause of the fall is a decrease in pulmonary blood flow. When blood flow to a lobe is kept constant and the adrenergic alpha receptors are blocked by injection of phentolamine, the inhalation of FC11 caused vasodilation. In the intact circulation, the vasodilation is masked by release of catecholamines which constrict the pulmonary blood vessels.\n",
      "Human placental delta5-3beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (delta5-3beta HSDH): intracellular distribution, kinetic properties, retroinhibition and influence of membrane delipidation. Delta5-3beta HSDH activity has been assayed either by spectrophotometric method or by use of radioactive substrates. The enzymatic activity is equally distributed between mitochondrial and microsomal fractions verified by electronic microscopy. The specific activity is comparable in both fractions, as well as the optimal pH and the Km for NAD and for the substrates. The delta5-3beta Hut optimal pH, specific activity and sensitivity to the inhibitory action of various steroids are different when C19 and C21 steroids are used as substrates. Estrogens and cyclic AMP have also an inhibitory action on the oxidation of C21 steroids. Treatment of microsomal or mitochondrial membranes with phospholipase A releases fatty acids (mainly arachidonic) and decreases the enzymatic activity. \"Adsorbtion\" of the fatty acids on bovine serum albumin partially reactivates the delta5-3beta HSDH.\n",
      "[Hydrolysis of insoluble collagen of bull bones by Streptomyces griseus crystalline protease]. Hydrolysis of collagen was studied in the bull bone tissues by the Str. griseus crystalline protease. The amount of collagen hydrolyzed by it composed 6.6% and 16% after 4-hour and 6-hour hydrolysis, respectively. When the enzyme:substrate ratio is 1:50 hydrolysis proceeds most intensively; with a decrease in the ratio up to 1:1000 the average amount of peptides increase from 2.6 up to 4 amino acidic residua, respectively. Under conditions of denaturated collagen hydrolysis the content of hydroxyproline in solution as compared with the native one increases; in this case the links with the presence of imino-acids are easier to split, the more resistant being those formed by hydroxyproline. Within the limit of 20-45 degrees C hydrolysis of protein intensifies with a temperature rise. Within the pH range of 5.0-11.0 the maximal amount of alpha- NH2-groups and hydroxyproline is observed at pH 8.5, the minimal--at PH 5.0. Hydroxyproline in the composition of peptides appears at the beginning of hydrolysis whereas the free one of enzymes of the longer effect 24 h after the beginning of the experiment composes 12.2% of its total content in the solved products. In the insoluble part of the substrate after 3-hour hydrolysis tyrosine composes less than 25% of its initial amount in protein whereas phenyl alanine--over 70%. After 6-hour hydrolysis the solved part of the system contains about 30% of alanine and 8.9 and 6% of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, respectively.\n",
      "Effect of heparin or saline dilution of blood on PCO2 and pH. The effect of different dilutions with heparin solutions or saline on blood PCO2, pH and standard bicarbonate was investigated. Blood was first equilibrated to give about 40 or 60 mmHg PCO2. The solutions were in equilibrium with room air. The effect on blood PCO2 etc. could be fully explained by the dilution with a medium having a much lower PCO2. Thus, correction of the heparin solution to pH 7.40 and PCO2 40 mmHg eliminated the effect on PCO2, pH and standard bicarbonate. With ordinary procedure for blood heparinization (about 2% dilution) the effect is practically negligible.\n",
      "[Specific p-nitrophenyl phosphatase of yeast Pichia guilliermondii]. The cells of yeast P. guilliermondii contain specific p-nitrophenyl phosphatase (pNPPase), the level of which depends on the cells supply with inorganic phosphorus. Partially purified enzyme is activated by ions Mg2+, Co2+ and somewhat weaker -- by ions Fe2+. With the presence of Mg2+ the enzyme activity is inhibited by ions Cd2+, Zn2+, f-, Be2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, MoO42-, Fe3+, Fe2+, inorganic phosphate as well as by EDTA. A mixture ions Be2+ and F- causes a complete inhibition of the activity. Ions K+ and Na+ inhibit to some extent the enzymic activity, ATP removes the inhibitory effect of monovalent cations. Km of pNPPase is equal to 3.3-10(-4) M, the molecular weight determined by the method of gelfiltration is 60 000. The enzyme is the most active at 50 degrees C and pH 9,5 PNPPase does not manifest the phosphotranspherase activity in tris-HC1-buffer.\n",
      "Diagnosis of renal tumor by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2). A urinary enzyme pattern and kidney tissue pattern were investigated simultaneously in 117 urologic patients. In contrast to all other renal disorders only the sixteen malignant tumors of the kidney showed a significant drop of gamma-GT in tumor tissue and urine. So far urinary enzymology has been used only as screening test. Measurement of gamma-GT in urine, however, permits the diagnosis of kidney tumors.\n",
      "Bilateral testicular seminoma in intra-abdominal testes. A seminoma of both intra-abdominal testes in a forty-five-year-old patient is reported. Discovery of the tumor was fortuitous during admission for upper lobe pneumonia. Of particular interest in this case is that seminoma was found in both undescended testes. Surgical extirpation of both degenerated testes along with prostatic utricle was performed. The patient refused radiotherapy.\n",
      "[Study of the amniotic fluid of sheep in the normal course of pregnancy and in abortion]. Cytologic, biochemical and immunoelectrophoretic studies were carried out of amniotic fluids in 100 ewes with normal pregnancy and 40 ewes that had miscarried. Each month of pregnancy a total of 20 and 8 animals of the two groups, respectively were studied. It was found that the biochemical and metabolic processes taking place in the fetus lead to changes in the amniotic fluids altering the pH value, the alkali reserve, the content of potassium, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase as well as their bactericidal activity. More characteristic changes linked with pregnancy were observed in the cell composition of the amniotic fluids. With advancing in age the increase in cell count was accompanied (staining with Nile blue sulfate) with a rise of the \"orange cell\" content. The amniotic fluids of ewes with normal pregnancy were found to contain proteins which precipitated with hyper immune sera against blood serum and kidney, heart, and placenta proteins. In ewes that had miscarried the pH values of the amniotic fluids dropped in the months when abortions took place: 7.36, 7.11, 6.90, 6.80 and 6.90, as against 7.41, 7.36, 7.28, 7.17 and 7.18, respectively. Along with pH the alkali reserve also dropped to 37.9 in the first month and 14.20 in the fifth month. In ewes that had miscarried in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th month these values were 18.90, 14.90, and 13.80 cu. cm, respectively. In cases of abortions the protein composition of the amniotic fluids showed higher levels of the alfa and beta globulins.\n",
      "[Adrenal-like Leydig cells (author's transl)]. Adrenal-like lipoid-rich Leydig cells, which could be found in a cryptorchid testis, were investigated by light and electronmicroscopy. There were nodular and diffuse proliferation of these adrenal-like cells in the interstitium of the testis. Electronmicroscopically these cells are fasciculated and characterized by large liposomes, many tubulovesicular mitochondria, and a large smooth endoplasmatic reticulum. But the presence of crystals of Reinke in these cells underlined their relationship to Leydig cells. The clinical history of this case is characterised by an extreme adipositas (167 kg) and high urinary estrogenexcretion. This excretion could be suppressed with dexamethasone and stimulated with HCG. After orchiectomy estrogen excretion decreased for 4 months and then increased again, after ACTH stimulation performed by reason of adrenal insufficiency. At this time there is no evidence of adrenal tumor; in the contralateral, scrotal testis, spermiogenesis and Leydig cells are without pathologic changes as revealed by biopsy.\n",
      "[Properties of partially purified ATP desaminase from Actinomyces N4 antibioticus]. Three active fractions of ATP desaminase from Actinomyces N4 of type Antibioticus were obtained by gel filtration through Sephadex G-200.

The enzyme studied could be used for preparation of ITP, IDP, IMP, inosine and hypoxantine.\n",
      "[Changes in the content of ribosomal RNA and the activity of ribosomal RNAase in the brain under natural physiological conditions]. Optimal activity of RNAase from brain ribosomal fraction was observed at pH 5.4 and pH 7.9. After alimentary and conditioned-alimentary stimulation content of rRNA was significantly increased in brain, but the RNAase activity was decreased more than two-fold. After conditioned-alimentary inhibition content of rRNA was slightly decreased as compared to experiments with alimentary and conditioned-alimentary stimulation, but it was distinctly higher than in control. As compared with alimentary stimulation in the conditioned-alimentary stimulation the RNAase activity was increased at pH 5.4 and decreased at pH 7.9.\n",
      "[Effect of the antibiotic D-cycloserine and its dimer on the activity of tyrosine aminotransferase in liver tissue of intact, adrenalectomized and hypophysectomized rats]. In a period of lowest day activity of tyrosine aminotransferase, within 6-8 days after bilatheral adrenalectomy, the enzyme activity was decreased by about 20% as compared with an adequate control. At the same time, within a day and seven days after hypophisectomy, in rat liver tissue the enzyme activity was increased, approximately two-fold as compared with the normal state. Within four hrs after intraperitoneal administration into intact fasting rats at a dose of 2-2.5 g per 1 kg of body weight D-cycloserine and its dimer caused an induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by 75% and 180%, respectively. Induction of the enzyme by D-cycloserine and its dimer was inhibited by actinomycin D; the phenomenon was not observed in adrenalectomized rats. Within a day after hypophisectomy D-cycloserine did not cause the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase in rat liver tissue; to the contrary, the dimer of D-cycloserine caused induction of the enzyme, comparable to the ACTH effect, in liver tissue of hypophisectomized rats.\n",
      "[Analysis of inhibition in pathways of NADP.H2 and NAD.H2 oxidation in liver tissue microsomes]. Microsomal complexes of electron transfer were resistant to typical inhibitors of mitochondrial pathway of electron transport. In oxidation of NADP.H2 there were at least three point of molecular O2 reduction: NADP.H2-specific flavoprotein, Fe2+ participating in reactions of peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and cytochrome P-450. Efficiency of cytochrome P-450 inhibitors could not be evaluated by polarography as in the pathway several sites of molecular O2 activation were observed. In oxidation of NADP.H2 estimation of the rate of electron transfer reactions was carried out by monitoring of velocity of O2 absorption in presence of EDTA (inhibitor of the reaction of peroxidation) because about 50% of the total oxygen were utilized only in the process where NADP.H2 was oxidized. NAD.H2 oxidation, inhibited with EDTA, was activated by addition of Ca2+.\n",

Single administration of hydrocortisone or insulin into rats (body weight 200 g) and also combined treatment of the animals with the hormones at large doses caused a distinct increase in activities of anode and cathode isoenzymes of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase in soluble fraction; total activity of the enzyme was also increased in mitochondria of rat liver tissue.\n",
      "[Changes in cerebrospinal fluid lactate and pyruvate levels during brain surgery under fluotane anesthesia]. The lactate and pyruvate content in the arterial blood and CSF of 24 patients operated on the brain under fluothane anesthesia with artificial ventilation of the lungs was measured. Towards the end of the operation and anesthesia a sizably elevated lactate level and accumulation of its excess in the blood were noted, these shifts having been more marked with hypocapnic ventilation of the lungs. An increased concentration of lactate and pyruvate in the cerebrospinal fluid was not attended by accumulation of lactate excess.\n",

      "[A pharmacologic analysis of preparatory mechanisms of stereotyped activity in dogs]. In dogs with elaborated rhythmic and mozaic stereotypes of secretory and motor situational conditioned reflexes specific features were revealed in the action of some neurotropic drugs (amizyl, amedine, diphacil, pediphene, chlorpromazine and sodium oxybutyrate) on preparatory (latent) conditions of excitation and inhibition, appearing in the stabilized systems of reflexes. Pharmacological analysis has pointed to the predominantly cholinergic nature of preparatory and trigger mechanisms of alimentary conditioned activity. The blockade of M-cholinoreceptors (by means of amizyl and amedine) weakens or eliminates the preparatory conditions appearing in a dynamic stereotype and disturbs the trigger reactions within three to ten days. A pediphene blockade of H-cholinoreceptors intensifies the preparatory states.\n",
      "[The distribution of benorylate in plasma, synovial fluid and synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis]. The authors report on the drug benorylate which is available in the Federal Republic under the name of Benortan (4-acetamidophenyl-2-acetoxybenzoat). Numerous examinations have shown that it is well tolerated by mouth and that it has beneficial clinical effects with few side effects. Benorylate is a neutral, fat-soluble, water-insoluble substance which upon absorption is almost completely hydrolyzed into salicylate and paracetamol. 6 patients with classical seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and with a highly active synovialitis of one or both knee joints not previously treated received 4 g of a 40% benorylate suspension orally twice daily over a period of 9-14 days. On different days at exactly determined times of drug administration blood, and on the day of synovectomy synovial fluid and synovial tissue, were taken and frozen to - 70 degrees C and subsequently examined as to the content of salicylate, paracetamol, and unchanged benorylate. The plasma levels of salicylate and paracetamol were generally distinctly higher than the concentrations of these metabolites in the synovial fluid. Benorylate which is practically not detectable in blood is found in the synovial tissue and is detectable in greatest quantities in the most inflamed synovial villi. Benorylate can probably penetrate into the synovial membrane like its metabolites salicylate and paracetamol; it remains, however, to be examined whether the metabolites are distributed differently in different synovial areas (active inflamed and unattacked synovial tissue, respectively) in the same way as benorylate per se.\n",
      "[In vitro effect of leukocytic and thymic histones and their fractions on the activity of the causative agent of meningopneumonia]. It was found in studying the antimeningococcus activity of the leukocytic and thymus histones and their fractions that both histones were capable of neutralizing in vitro the activity of the causative agent of meningopneumonia (MP). The neutralization effect was chiefly associated with the F3 fraction rich in arginine and depended on the duration of the histone fraction contact with the MP causative agent, the weight concentration of the histone and the pH of the incubation medium.\n",
      "[Immunological polyfunctionality of proteins and its meaning for the analysis of an allergen-active bacterial substrate]. It was shown with the aid of immunosorption of an allergen-active substrate of E. coli 020: K84 (No. 2-rII) that protein substances taking part in the phenomenon of cell hypersensitivity were active in the humoral immunity reactions. The allergenic and immunochemical activity served as functions of the same molecules of bacterial proteins, this substantiating the use of immunochemical analysis for the study of an allergen-active bacterial substrate. By protein denaturing it is possible to obtain immunochemical inert allergen-active preparations capable of detecting the cell hypersensitivity to crude bacterial proteins. The problem of immunological polyfunctionality of proteins is discussed from the aspect of nonhomogeneity of their antigenic determinant groups.\n",
      "[Some properties of the alpha-hemolysin produced by a hemolytic strain of E. coli]. It was found that alpha-hemolysin of E. coli P 678 HIy+ was maximally active against human erythrocytes at pH 6.5. The hemolytic activity is characterized in time by a distinct lag-phase and a phase of the greatest velocity of the reaction immediately following it. The duration of the lag-phase and also the rate of hemolysis depends on alpha-hemolysin concentration, whose increase is accompanied by a decrease of the lag-phase and acceleration of hemolysis. There is a definite limit below which the duration of the lag-phase remains unchanged with further increase of hemolysin concentration. There was noted a linear relationship between the amount of erythrocytes taken for the test and the rate of hemoglobin release and also a temperature activation of the hemolytic reaction.\n",

      "Affinity elution of pyruvate kinase from phosphocellulose. Pyruvate kinase from ascites tumour cells can be eluted from phosphocellulose by very low concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate and pyrophosphate, respectively. The appropriate limiting conditions for \"facilitated desorption\" of the enzyme from phosphocellulose by these ligands have been elaborated for achieving maximum selectivity and recovery in the process of its purification. This method has been designated as \"affinity elution chromatography\" owing to the specific interactions between a ligand as a constituent of the eluting medium with the adsorbed enzyme, which causes its selective desorption from the ion-exchanger. Affinity elution with phosphoenolpyruvate has been found to be very effective for preparation of the M-types of pyruvate kinase. A specific activity of 420 for an almost homogeneous preparation of pyruvate kinase from ascites tumour cells has maximally been obtained.\n",
      "[Influence of temperature on enzyme activity determination in serum : L-aspartate aminotransferase isoenzymes]. The influence of temperature on activity assays of the isoenzymes of L-aspartic aminotransferase in described. For this purpose, isolated human isoenzymes were added to inactivated serum. Half-saturation constants were determined at 17.8 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 37 degrees C, and the substrate saturation and pH curves were recorded. The cytoplasmatic (c) and mitochondrial (m) GOT showed temperature-dependent differences in the half-saturation constants for the substrates L-aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate. For both isoenzymes pH 7.4 is considered the optimum regardless of the temperature of measurement, and Tris-HCl is the optimal buffer. In the Arrhenius plot there is a bent at 27 degrees C for both isoenzymes. Thermal denaturation as a possible reason for this deviation from the linearity in the Arrhenius plot could be ruled out.\n",

      "[Modification of the adjuvans arthritis by carrageenin, compound 48/80, histamine- and serotonin antagonists, non-steroid antiphlogistics as well as protease inhibitors and their possible relations to inflammation mediators]. 1. Injections of carrageenin (1,25 mg/kg i.v.) from the 1st to the 3rd day and then each 2nd or 3rd day inhibited paw swelling in adjuvant arthritis of the rat during the time of treatment. Injections from the 11th to the 15th day were ineffective. The level of plasma kininogen was slightly decreased but the total complement serum level was significantly lowered. 2,5 and 3 mg carrageenin/kg respectively were toxic after repeated injections. After a single administration the levels of plasma kininogen and of total serum complement were decreased by 50% although paw swelling was not affected. 2. Pentosane polysulfoester (25 mg/kg i.v.) did not influence paw swelling despite daily administration from the 1st to the 17th day. Heparin (10 000 IE/kg i.v.) was likewise ineffective. 3. Single or repeated injections of compound 48/80 (0,125-0,5 mg/kg i.v.; 1-5 mg/kg i.p.; 3-6 mg/kg s.c.), reserpine (0,2 mg/kg i.p.), cyproheptadine (5 mg/kg i.v.), bromolysergic acid diethylamide (2 x 2 mg/kg i.v.) or metiamide (10 mg/kg i.v.) were without effect on paw swelling. Neither did compound 48/80 effect the complement serum level. 4. Daily administration of chloropromazine (4-10 mg/kg p.o.) or of promethazine (10-15 mg/kg s.c. or p.o.) inhibited paw swelling in the first phase of adjuvant arthritis but not in the second one. 5. The soybean trypsin inhibitor (15 mg/kg i.v.) inhibited paw swelling significantly up to the 4th day, the Kunitz inhibitor (25 000 E/kg i.v.) was ineffective. 6. The content of prostaglandin E of the inflamed paws was increased threefold in both phases of arthritis.

      "Properties of plasma membranes from granulation tissue with reference to extracellular matrix. Treatment with neuraminidase decreased the activity of Na+,K+-activated Mg2+-adenosine triphosphatase in plasma membranes isolated from experimental granulation tissue but not that of 5'-nucleotidase or leucine-beta-naphthylamidase. A temporary lowering of the pH of the plasma membrane suspension to 2-3 inactivated all three enzymes, which remained inactive after the pH had been readjusted to 7.4. Addition of dextran preparations to the membrane suspension decreased the activity of adenosine triphosphatase. Ethanol (0.4%) had a similar effect. These marker enzymes of plasma membranes were not affected by additions of hyaluronate, chondroitin sulfate, protein polysaccharide or soluble collagen. Serotonin stimulated the adenosine triphosphatase activity slightly. About 10-20% of the protein in the plasma membrane preparation was extracted with EDTA. This \"fuzzy coat\" fraction yielded a distinct gel-electrophoretic protein pattern. Hyaluronidase was not helpful in cleaving this surface layer from the plasma membranes.\n",

In a double-blind trial lasting 2 weeks, a new, long-acting antihistamine, Mequitazine, and a placebo, were compared. 115 allergic patients participated in this experiment (mequitazine n = 56, placebo n = 59). Therapeutic results and the effect on diurnal alertness were evaluated by means of a questionnaire filled in daily by the patients. Whether considering the day by day results or the results of the entire treatment period, statistically, Mequitazine (10 mg/24 hrs) is very significantly more active than the placebo. The daytime drowsiness induced by Mequitazine is statistically no greater than that induced by the placebo, whether analyzed on a day by day basis or over the entire treatment period (P = 0.23).

      "Influence of changes in arterial PCO2 on cerebral blood flow and cerebral energy state during hypothermia in the rat. In order to study the relationship between arterial PCO2 and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in hypothermia, the body temperature of artifically ventilated rats was decreased to 22 degreesC, and changes in CBF were evaluated from arteriovenous differences in oxygen content (AVDO2) at PaCO2 values of 15, 30, 40 and 60 mm Hg. The results were compared to those obtained at normal body temperature (37 degrees C) over the PaCO2 range 15-60 mm Hg. Separate experiments were performed to evaluate CBF and CMRO2 at 22 degrees C and a PaCO2 of 15 mm Hg, using an inert gas technique for CBF. The tissue contents of phosphocreatine, ATP, ADP, AMP and lactate were measured in hypothermic animals at PaCO2 values of 15, 30 and 60 mm Hg. The results showed that changes in CBF were of the same relative magnitude in hypothermia and normothermia when PaCO2 was increased from about 35 to about 60 mm Hg. However, with a decrease in PaCO2 the reduction in CBF was much more pronounced in hypothermia, and at PaCO2 15 Mm Hg CBF was less then 20% of the value measured in normothermic and normocapnic animals. The results of the metabolite measurements gave no evidence of tissue hypoxia in spite of the pronounced reduction in CBF. Although the results demonstrate that the brain of a hypothermic animal is protected against the harmful effects of a lowered CBF, it may not warrant recommending hyperventilation in clinical cases of hypothermia, especially not in patients with arteriosclerosis or cerebrovascular diseases.\n",

      "Reactions of the arterial blood pressure in changed haemodynamic conditions and under the effect of bilateral carotid occlusion. In order to throw light on the problems related to the magnitude and the possibility of maintaining pressor response in the case of bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO), acute experiments were carried out on heparinized cats in chloralose-urethane narcosis and spontaneous respiration. The perfusion pressure in a hind leg autoperfused with a roller pump with a constant flow and the arterial blood pressure were recorded electromanometrically. A study was made of the changes taking place under the effect of BCO in the normal animal, in animals in a haemorrhagic state, after pharmacological alpha-adrenergic blockade, haemorrhage after alpha-adrenergic blockade, retransfusion of blood + alpha-adrenergic blocking agent and after local application of 0.01 papaverine. It was established that some of the factors determining the haemodynamic state of the organism, such as: blood volume, arterial pressure, vascular resistance, cardiac output, etc., are of great significance for the realization of the pressor response to BCO, but the haemodynamic state of the animal before the occlusion and the interactions between the abovementioned factors are decisive for the form, magnitude and maintenance of the pressor response in BCO.\n",
      "On the mechanism of the relaxing adrenaline effect on cat jejunum. The effect of propranolol, phentolamine, papaverine, theophyline and Ca++, administered in different combinations of their threshold doses, on the relaxing effect of adrenaline was studied on an isolated segment of proximal jejunum of male cats. It was established that phentolamine weakened the relaxing effect of adrenaline, while propranolol had no effect on it. Papaverine potentiated the relaxinf effects of adrenaline both when administered alone and in combination with propranolol or with phentolamine. Theophylline weakened the relaxing effect of adfrenaline and of the combination phentolamine-adrenaline. Ca++ increased the smooth-muscle tone. The interpretation of the results obtained leads to the fundamental conclusions that the relaxing effect of adrenaline on cat jejunum is more alpha- than beta-adrenergically determined and that the system of the cyclic AMP participates in its realization. At the smae time, however, the possibility of participation of other mechanisms is not excluded. The smooth-muscle effect of papaverine and theophylline is not determined only by their inhibitory effect on phosphodiesterase.\n",
      "A method for the continuous study of net water transport in the feline small bowel. A new perfusion technique has been developed for the study of net water transport across the intestinal epithelium in vivo. The lumen of an isolated intestinal segment is steadily perfused with a solution of known composition in a closed perfusion system with a reservoir large enough to prevent recirculation. The intestinal segment may be enclosed in a plethysmorgraph. Changes in the perfused volume is recorded by a volume transducer coupled to the recirculating system via a T-tube. If no motility occurs, the changes of the perfusion volume reflects net water transport across the intestinal epithelium. A quantitative comparison of this technique with the convention polyethylene glycol method revealed no significant difference. The plethysmorgraphic method also makes it possible to quantify the net water absorption via lymph and blood.\n",
      "Effect of bulbar acidification on basal secretion of acid and gastrin in dog. Dogs were provided with mucosal septal pouches of the stomach and of the duodenal bulb. In some dogs a drainage gastric cannula was inserted into the most dependent portion of the stomach. In dogs which were found to secrete acid spontaneously during a control period at the start of each experiment, the bulbar puches were perfused with 0.1 M HC1 for 5-120 min. Bulbar acidification rapidly and profoundly reduced the basal acid output. In dogs which did not secrete acid spontaneously during the control periodbulbar pouches were perfused with 0.1 M HC1 for 1 h. Bulbar acidification did not significantly influence the plasma gastrin concentration and no acid was secreted from the Pavlov pouches following such acidification. The present results support the hypothesis that reduction of the intrabulbar pH may contribute to the reduction of acid secretion during interdigestive periods. The physiological significance of of mechanisms in the upper intestine which induce acid secretion following a reduction of the intraluminal pH is questioned.\n",
      "Differentiation of newly isolated strains of Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi by agglutination and precipitation reactions. Serological relationships between new isolates of Trypanosoma cruzi from a single locality have been examined by direct agglutination and immunodiffusion, and compared with established strains. The strains were divided into three groups according to the absorption properties of their precipitinogens. The three groups were defined by the same characteristics as those in which strains of wide-ranging provenance and long laboratory history have been placed by previous workers. A lack of correspondence between the antigenic constitutions of the groups as described here and as described previously was demonstrated using reference strains. Relatedness values were calculated from agglutination titres, which indicated a complex heterogeneity of antigens, and from which a scheme of relationships was drawn.\n",
      "Classification and biological distribution of histamine receptor sub-types. The distribution and classification of histamine receptors in mammalian and avian tissues have been summarized in Tables 1-4. It is evident that histamine receptors are present on a number of morphologically distinct cell types and the proportion of cells bearing H1- and H2-receptors varies not only with the species but also with the cell source. The pharmacological receptors mediating mepyramine-sensitive histamine responses have been defined as H1-receptors. Receptors mediating mepyramine-resistant, but burimamide or metiamide-sensitive histamine responses have been classified as H2-receptors. Histamine responses mediated via H2-receptors seem to involve the adenylcyclase system resulting in elevation of intracellular cyclic-AMP level, which is susceptible to burimamide blockade but insensitive to beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This mode of action of histamine involving H2-receptors and the adenyl cyclase system has been shown to stimulate the mammalian heart; promote gastric acid secretion; inhibit antigen-induced histamine release from leucocytes and inhibit lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. It can further be concluded that both H1- and H2-receptors are widely distributed throughout the animal body in the gastro-intestinal, reproductive, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, nervous system and on mast cells and blood leucocytes. In these tissues, histamine receptors play an important role in physiological, immunological and immunopathological processes. Interaction of histamine with both H1- and H2-receptors in varying proportions modulates the overall manifestation of cardiovascular and respiratory syndromes during certain immunopathological conditions (e.g. inflammation, allergy and anaphylaxis). Histamine receptors also appear to play and important role in the development of immuno-competence and immunity.\n",
      "Identification of T. brucei-subgroup strains isolated from game. Several T. brucei-subgroup strains isolated from game were investigated with the blood incubation infectivity test (BIIT) and in human volunteers. Original isolates and their clones derivatives were tested. In order to check the validity of the BIIT, volunteer tested clones were used under modified BIIT conditions. Inoculation of different trypanosome strains into volunteers yielded positive parasitaemia for original isolates from lion, hyaena, and Coke's hartebeest. Changing antibody titers during the course of infection in the volunteers were checked with the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFT). The BIIT WAs reliable (consistently positive) for cloned T. b. rhodesiense. When testing T. b. brucei, the BIIT results depended on the number of incubated parasites and on the parasitaemia peak number the tested trypanosomes derived from. It was further shown that the in vivo part of the BIIT is actually essential for the complete neutralization of T. b. brucei induced by the action of human plasma. Tests with trypanosomes originating from experimentally mixed T. b. rhodesiense and brucei infections gave inconsistent results. On the other hand, pure populations mixed in vitro-prior to incubation for BIIT-revealed results depending on the proportion of the 2 species: up to 20% T. b. rhodesiense gave negative, higher concentrations consistently positive results.\n",
      "Studies on malaria and responses of Anopheles balabacensis balabacensis and Anopheles minimus to DDT residual spraying in Thailand. Studies on malaria and on A. b. balabacensis and A. minimus responses to DDT spraying were conducted in a forested hilly area in northern Thailand. In a first phase, base-line data were collected from July 1970 to March 1972. In a second phase, the study area received five round of DDT spraying over a period of two years and at the same time all malaria infections received radical treatment. During this two-year period of field operations, entomological and epidemiological observations were continued. The studies carried out in the second phase, showed that malaria transmission decreased under the applied optimum anti-malarial measures but was not interrupted. Human ecology and population movement inside the forest, especially during the dry season, contributed to a great extent to this result. The transmission occurring in the early part of the monsoon season clearly indicates the importance of the timing of DDT spraying. A. b. balabacensis appeared to be transmitting malaria all the year round in the deep forest but only in the monsoon season in the forest fringe. The vectorial capacity of both vectors was estimated separately for indoor and outdoor populations. The pre-spraying values obtained for A. b. balabacensis were much higher thaan for A. minimus. After DDT spraying A. b. balabacensis showed a decrease in vectorial capacity estimated at 31.5 times for the indoor population and 18 times for the outdoor population. A. minimus, on the other hand, showed a much smaller decrease, estimated at 6.8 and 1.9 times for the indoor and outdoor populations respectively.\n",
      "[Ecological study of Ixodes ricinus (Linné, 1758) (Acarina, Ixodoides) in southeastern France]. Ixodes ricinus (LINNE, 1758) is being surveyed in the northern Alp and the Jura mountains. This species, quite often found in the mesophilous forests of the hills, preferably takes root in the forest clusters, where there is a mull type mild humus often covered with an abundant litter. Such plant layers maintain a high degree of moisture, which beneficially affects this species. Examinations performed for three years in a southern Jura's resort allow for securing a preliminary approximation as regards the seasonal population variations.\n",
      "The micro-organisms of tsetse flies. Micro-organisms from tsetse fly mycetomes were maintained in culture, where they were more pleomorphic than in the mycetomes, but were in some cases very similar to those observed in ovaries by other authors. Agglutination tests on the cultured forms indicated in affinity to Rickettsia. They were sensitive to antibiotics introduced by feeding flies on hosts treated with Ampicillin; this reduced the longevity and fecundity of the tsetse flies and appeared to disturb normal digestion of bloodmeals.\n",
      "The histopathology of experimental disease produced in mice infected with Trypanosoma vivax. An acute form of trypanosomiasis (course of disease 4 to 8 days) was produced in mice experimentally infected with a strain of T. vivax. The features of the disease were: a parasitemia which appeared to increase exponentially from 23.8 to 243.6 times 10(6) trypanosomes per ml within the last 24 hours of the disease; anaemia was not severe in the disease in mice; the basic histological lesion was generalized fibrin thrombus formation in the blood vessels of the heart, lung, spleen and brain; trypanosome enboli were present in the brain, spleen and liver of infected mice. The disease in mice could prove a useful model in studies of the pathogenesis of acute trypanosomiasis and also in studies in the mechanism of generalized intravascular coagulation.\n",
      "Lipase and unspecific esterase activity in the fat body of Aedes aegypti L. In the fat body of Aedes aegypti a very high unspecific esterase activity and a low lipolytic activity was found. The electrophoretic isozyme patterns of the unspecific esterases show only few changes in the different physiological stages. The activity of the unspecific esterases as well as of the lipase is especially high in young sugar fed and in blood fed mosquitoes which points to special energy requirements in these stages. The role of the unspecific esterases is discussed.\n",
      "Effect of adsorbents on IgM and IgG measles antibodies. Sera from rabbits immunized with L-16 measles virus absorded with monkey blood cells; kaolin and blood cells; and MnCl2 and heparin were examined in haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralization tests. Kaolin and MnCl2 adsorbed primarily HI IgM antibodies from the early immunization period. The adsorbents used had no influence on HI and neutralization IgG antibodies. Human convalescent serum gave similar results, i.e. only IgG antibodies were found and they were not affected by kaolin and MnCl2 with heparin.\n",
      "Correlation between molecular size and interferon- inducing activity of poly I:C. Electron microscopy showed that commerical poly I: C consisted of molecules varying in length from less than 0.05 nm to more than 5 nm and also in morphology . To clarify the relationship between its molecular size and interferon-inducing activity, poly I: C was sonicated or fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the molecular length distribution and interferon-inducing activity of each preparation was determined in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that (1) poly I : C molecules 0.1-0.3 nm long were the most effective for interferon induction; (2) sonication of poly I : C reduced its molecular length and also the interferon-inducing activity, the degree of reduction varying in different fractions; and (3) the interferon-inducing activity of poly I: C of 0.1-0.3 nm obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was higher than that poly I: C of corresponding length prepared by sonication.\n",
      "Distribution of Lednice (Yaba 1) virus in the chick embryo. Distribution of Lednice (Yaba 1) virus antigen (LVA) was followed by immunofluorescene (IF) in chick embryos inoculated into the yolk sacs. Positive fluorescence of LVA was observed in neurons and neuroblasts of the developing brain, spinal cord and spinal ganglia as well as in skeletal muscles, heart muscle, vascular endothelium and lung mesenchyma. In the yolk sac, foci of specific fluorescence were occasionally seen in endothelium cells of vessels and in islands of extraembryonic haematopoesis. At sites corresponding to the occurrence of LVA, extensive oedema was accompanied by extravazation of erythrocytes and accumulation of white blood cells. The nature of tissues in which the virus replicates was discussed from the point of view of LVA distribution and the morphological lesions observed.\n",
      "Serological differences between some isolates of bean yellow mosaic virus. The degree of serological relatedness of three isolates of bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) was studied. One common antigenic group (m) was demonstrated in all 3 isolates. In addition, another antigenic group (a) was demonstrated in the isolate FvM1. This group was absent from the isolates TpM3 and TpM11, in which the antigenic group n was found. Antisera to the 3 isolates contained the corresponding antibody groups. The antibody group (M) shared by all 3 BYMV isolates was present in the FvM1 antiserum in a level only a little higher than the second antibody group (A). Antisera to TpM3 and TpM11 isolates showed only a low titre of M antibody, while the second antibody group (N) reached titres from 512 to 1024. Cross-absorption tests revealed serological identity of both isolates of the \"necrotic type\" (TpM3 and TpM11) and allowed to estimate the degree of their serological relatedness to representatives of the \"mosaic type\" isolates of BYMV (FvM1).\n",

Changes in the biological properties of the vaccine strain E of Rickettsia prowazeki occurred upon cultivation of A1 (human amnion) cells infected with this strain. In the course of passages of these cells the antigenic activity and virulence of the rickettsia increased. The changes were observed in 10 out of 22 cell cultures examined: in 6 cultures there was an increase in the antigenic activity and in 4 both in the antigenic activity and in virulence.

      "Characterization of Nigerian strains of West Nile virus by plaque formation. Seven strains of West nile virus isolated in Nigeria were investigated for their ability to form plaques in monkey kidney cell monolayers. Five strains antigenically related to one another produced plaques of about the same size 3 to 4 days after the addition of the overlay medium. The two other strains closely related to each other produced no plaques. Their inability to produce plaques was regarded as a significant characteristic of the intratypic group to which the two strains belong.\n",

      "On the problem of oncogene of tumour viruses. The approach to the problem of oncogenesis of tumorigenic viruses is compared and analyzed from the position of the Altshtein-Vogt hypothesis and from that of the general theory of oncogenesis advanced by the present author. In contrast to the hypothesis of Altshtein-Vogt dealing mainly with the problem of oncogene origin, the general theory of oncogenesis not only defines concretely the origin of the oncogene and the essence of its product, but also makes it possible to understand why, when and how integration of the oncogene with the genome of the cell leads to the transformation of the cell into a benign cell and when into a malignant tumour cell. An analysis of the essence of the \"oncogene position effect\" from this standpoint shows that an integration, similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity, of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral stable (life-long) immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by \"slow\" viruses.\n",
      "Electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic drugs. Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants. Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine). Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease. Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.\n",
      "Nutrition education in the medical school curriculum: a proposal for action: a curriculum design. Nutrition has been traditionally taught in medical schools with emphasis on clinical management of disease states with modified diets. However, the science of nutrition can no longer be considered only in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of nutritional deficiency diseases. Prevention of disease-care rather than cure-must be emphasized. Using the nutrition concepts that evolved from the 1972 Williamsburg Conference encompassing the science and the sociology of nutrition, the author offers a proposal for action-a sequential nutrition curriculum design for years, I, II, and III of undergraduate medical education based on the experiences of the Nutrition Division, Department of Community Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine-City University of New York.\n",

Thirty-four patients with life-threatening childhood status asthmaticus were treated with intravenous isoproterenol infusions. Twenty-seven responded favorably; seven failed to respond and underwent mechanical ventilation. Intravenously administered isoporterenol was a useful therapeutic adjunct in the treatment of these severe attacks. Complications in these cases were rare, but cardiac arrhythmia, rebound bronchospasm, and acute mobilization of secretions need to be considered. Further evaluation of the efficacy of intravenous infusions of isoproterenol in status asthmaticus would be valuable.\n",

      "Rapid infusion of sodium bicarbonate and albumin into high-risk premature infants soon after birth: a controlled, prospective trial. We conducted a controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and salt-poor albumin into high-risk, premature infants in the first 2 hours of life. Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.\n",
      "Effect of pH on ionic exchange and function in rat and rabbit myocardium. The effects of pH variation on ionic exchange and mechanical function were studied in the arterially perfused rat and rabbit septa. The pH and PCO2 of the control perfusate were 7.40 and 39 mmHg, respectively. In the rabbit septum a metabolic acidosis (pH equals 6.82, PCO2 equals 39 mmHg) caused a loss of 16% of control tension in 12 min. Na+ and K+ exchange were unaltered. A comparable respiratory acidosis (pH equals 6.81, PCO2 equals 159 mmHg) caused a 51% loss of tension in 2 min. Na+ exchange was unaltered but K+ efflux fell from 8.9 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SE) to 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt per min (P less than 0.001, n equals 10). A net gain of K+ of 16.9 +/- 1.7 (n equals 14) mmol/kg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in K+ influx relative to efflux over 15 min. The net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rabbit septum. These results suggest that the net uptake of K+, which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization, and the changes of contractility are controlled by the H+ ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion. Changes of contractility are not related to the net uptake of K+.\n",
      "Acid-base balance in amphibian gastric mucosa. It has been established that H+ secretion can be maintained in frog stomach in the absence of exogenous CO2 by using a nutrient bathing fluid containing 25 mM H2PO4 (pH approximately equal to 4.5) or by lowering the pH of a nonbuffered nutrient solution to about 3.0-3.6. Exogenous CO2 in the presence of these nutrient solutions uniformly caused a marked decrease in H+ secretion, PD, adn short-circuit current (Isc) and an increase in transmucosal resistance (R). Elevation of nutrient [k+] to 83 mM reduced R significantly but transiently without change in H+ when nutrient pH less than 5.0, whereas R returned to base line and H+ increased when nutrient pH greater than 5.0. Acidification of the nutrient medium in the presence of exogenous CO2 results in inhibition of the secretory pump, probably by decreasing intracellular pH, and also interferes with conductance at the nutrient membrane. Removal of exogenous CO2 from standard bicarbonate nutrient solution reduced by 50% the H+, PD, and Isc without change in R; K+-free nutrient solutions reverse these changes in Isc and PD but not in H+. The dropping PD and rising R induced by K+-free nutrient solutions in 5% CO2 - 95% O2 are returned toward normal by 100% O2. Our findings support an important role for exogenous CO2 in maintaining normal acid-base balance in frog mucosa by acting as an acidifying agent.\n",
      "Effect of sodium nitrate loading on electrolyte transport by the renal tubule. Effects of sodium nitrate were compared with sodium chloride loading on transport of electrolytes by the nephron. Maximal levels of free water clearance/clomerular filtration rate (CH2O/GFR) averaged 8.4% with nitrate loading and 14.4% with saline loading. Since ethacrynic acid and chlorothiazide exert their major natriuretic effect in the distal nephron, the increment in Na ad Cl reabsorbed beyond the proximal tubule. The administration of these agents resulted in an increase in fractional sodium excretion (CNa/GFR) of 21.1%, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) of 1,126 mueq/min, and urinary chloride excretion (UClV) of 848 mueq/min during nitrate loading compared with an increase in CNa/GFR of 37.6%, UNaV of 2,362 mueq/min, and UClV of 2,397 mueq/min during saline loading. The smaller diuretic-induced increment in Na and Cl excretion in the nitrate studies suggests, as do the hydrated studies, that less Cl and Na are reabsorbed in the distal nephron during nitrate than saline loading. At every level of UNaV, fractional bicarbonate reabsorption was higher, urine pH was lower, and urinary potassium excretion (UKV) was higher in the nitrate studies. Thus, compared with saline loading, sodium nitrate decreases chloride and sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. The higher hydrogen and potassium secretion in the nitrate studies may be consequent to the decreased ability of the distal nephron to reabsorb chloride.\n",
      "Coronary vascular and myocardial responses to carotid body stimulation in the dog. Coronary vascular and myocardial responses to selective hypoxic and/or hypercapnic carotid chemoreceptor stimulation were investigated in constantly ventilated, pentobarbital or urethan-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Bilaterally isolated carotid chemoreceptors were perfused with autologous blood of varying O2 and CO2 tensions via an extracorporeal lung circuit. Systemic gas tensions were unchanged. Effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation on coronary vascular resistance, left ventricular dP/dt, and strain-gauge arch output were studied at natural coronary blood flow with the chest closed and during constant-flow perfusion of the left common coronary artery with the chest open. Carotid chemoreceptor stimulation slightly increased left ventricular dP/dt and slightly decreased the strain-gauge arch output, while markedly increasing systemic pressure. Coronary blood flow increased; however, coronary vascular resistance wa.as not affected. These studies show that local carotid body stimulation increases coronary blood flow but has little effect on the myocardium. The increase in coronary blood flow results mainly from an increase in systemic arterial pressure. Thus these data provide little evidence for increased sympathetic activity of the heart during local stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors with hypoxic and hypercapnic blood.\n",
      "Oxygenation of frog gastric mucosa in vitro. We have recently shown that 5% CO2/95% O2 in the serosal bathing solution, with 100% O2 in the mucosal solution, results in CO2-diffusion limitation of acid secretion in bullfrog gastric mucosa. Changing to 10% CO2/90% 02 on both surfaces doubles the acid secretory rate. We calculate that, were the rate of oxygen consumption to increase significantly as a result of secretory stimulation, the tissue would now be oxygen limited. This prediction is tested by raising the P02 by increasing the total pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. Since no change in acid secretory rate or potential difference was observed upon changing from PO2 = 0.9 to PO2 = 1.9 atm, we conclude that the tissue is not O2 limited at normal pressure. Decreasing PO2 below 0.9 atm, by contrast, decreases the acid secretory rate and raises both PD and resistance. We infer that the rate of oxygen consumption did not rise significantly when acid secretion was increased by supplying sufficient CO2.\n",
      "Mechanisms of disposal of acid and alkali in rabbit duodenum. Stripped duodenal mucosa of rabbits was mounted in Ussing chambers containing a Ringer solution gassed with 100% O2. The disappearance of acid or alkali from the mucosal solution of short-circuited tissue was measured with a pH stat while the serosal pH was kept at 7.4. The duodenum rapidly disposed of both acid and alkali; neither property was altered by gassing with N2 while iodoacetate was in the perfusing solutions. Prevention of release of CO2 from the mucosal chamber obliterated the early rapid phase of acid disposal by the mucosa while a similar maneuver in the serosal chamber increased the appearance of serosal acid without altering the rate of acid disposal. Gut sacs of rabbit duodenum in vitro and in vivo showed a positive correlation between acid disposal and the rate of luminal CO2 production. While acid disposal progressively decreased with time for the in vitro gut sacs, the in vivo gut sac showed no fatigue in this respect. Luminal acidification in the Ussing chamber was associated with a profound reduction in short-circuit current (Isc), partially reversible by elevation of the mucosal pH but not by luminal glucose.

The serious long-term complications of maintenance antipsychotic therapy led the authors to undertake a critical review of outpatient withdrawal studies. Key findings included the following: 1) for a least 40% of outpatient schizophrenics, drugs seem to be essential for survival in the community; 2) the majority of patients who relapse after drug withdrawal recompensate fairly rapidly upon reinstitution of antipsychotic drug therapy; 3) placebo survivors seem to function as well as drug survivors--thus the benefit of maintenance drug therapy appears to be prevention of relapse; and 4) some cases of early relapse after drug withdrawal may be due to dyskinesia rather than psychotic decompensation. The authors urge clinicians to evaluate each patient on maintenance antipsychotic therapy in terms of feasibility of drug withdrawal and offer practical guidelines for withdrawal and subsequent management.\n",
      "Task delegation to physician extenders--some comparisons. This study uses a task delegation questionnaire to compare 1973 physician extender practices in seven primary care-oriented sites with a physician attitude survey made in 1969. One additional site using no physician extenders was included as a control. The study involves both major types of physician extenders (physician assistants and nurse practitioners) in ambulatory practices with at least one year of experience in using such personnel. With minor exceptions, actual task delegation patterns conform with the 1969 attitudes of physicians as to which tasks \"could and should\" be delegated to physician extenders.\n",
      "Chest roentgenography as a window to the diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis. The chest roentgenographic findings in Takayasu's arteritis include widening of the ascending aorta, contour irregularities of the descending aorta, arotic calcifications, pulmonary arterial changes, rib notching, and hilar lymphadenopathy. The single most important diagnostic sign is a segmental calcification outlining a localized or diffuse narrowing of the aorta. The other signs may be suspicious or suggestive, but the diagnostic accuracy increases when several findings are present simultaneously.\n",
      "Evaluation of the Nissen antireflux procedure by esophageal manometry and twenty-four hour pH monitoring. Fifteen normal volunteers without symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and sixteen patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux unresponsive to medical management and having endoscopic esophagitis had esophageal manometry and twenty-four hour pH monitoring of the distal esophagus. The symptomatic patients underwent a Nissen antireflux procedure and were restudied at four months. After surgery, patients had less reflux, a higher sphincteric pressure, and an equal amount of sphincter within the abdomen as did asymptomatic control subjects.\n",
      "[Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone during anaesthesia and operative stress and beta-adrenergic blockade (author's transl)]. In 21 patients undergoing ear operations associated with minimal bleeding plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were studied before and during surgical procedure, and in the postoperative state. Studies were performed in two groups, one without (n=9) and one with beta-adrenergic blockade by Practolol (n=12). Plasma renin activity increased significantly during halothane anaesthesia alone whereas the surgical manipulations did not further influence mean values significantly. Thus, it seems to be established that anaesthesia per se influences renin secretion. On the other hand Practolol does not show an inhibiting effect. The plasma renin increase following anaesthesia is due to the hemodynamic including renal hemodynamic, changes as well as to activation of the sympatho-adrenal system. Changes in plasma aldosterone are variable. For the greater part of patients with beta-adrenergic blockade an increase during the operative procedure was found. However, in some patients especially in the control group, plasma aldosterone was unchanged or decreased in spite of increasing renin values. Significantly lower plasma potassium concentration in these cases seems to indicate the important contributing role of potassium for the short-term regulation of aldosterone secretion. Plasma sodium concentration remained unchanged for the periods studied.\n",
      "[Surgical criteria for reoperation in abdominal surgery]. Analysis of the surgical criteria for reintervention in Abdominal Surgery led to the accentuation of a certain number of pictures of occlusion, general infectious syndromes, postoperative peritonitis, gastro-intestinal fistula and hemorrhagic syndrome. In all cases, the clinical examination can be misleading in particular in the case of peritonitis, and the history and non-surgical criteria must be strongly borne in mind.\n",
      "[Nephrologic criteria for reoperation (in the framework of abdominal surgery)]. 38 cases of abdominal surgery in acute renal failure, checked anatomically by reintervention or autopsy, were analyzed. The authors emphasize the frequency of the state of shock (2/3 of the cases) and the misleading nature of local signs. They stress the value of routinely checking creatinine clearance in the preoperative check-up in order to screen for latent renal failure.\n",

In summary, 40 p. 100 of 104 reinterventions carried out in 71 patients from the Resuscitation sector were decided upon in the absence of surgical and nephrological criteria. The authors emphasize the value of the infectious syndrome (74 p. 100 of the cases), of water and electrolyte disorders (60 p. 100 of the cases), and of hypercatabolism (83 p. 100 of the cases).\n",
      "[Preparation of the patient for reoperation].

      "[Anesthesia in reoperations in abdominal surgery]. Fifty one patients from different surgical units, hence anesthetized by different anaesthesists, underwent reinterventions in abdominal surgery. The indications for the first intervention essentially involved the supra-mesocolic region of the abdomen (62 out of 100 cases). The operative risk during the first intervention was on the average 18 pour cent. The protocol of the first anaesthesia which was known in 42 cases, was of the narco-ataralgestic type. The date of the return to the operation table varied from 1 to 60 days. The state of the patients was in general catastrophic (organic renal failure, acute respiratory failure). Here again the anaesthesia was of the narco-ataralgesic type but the choice of drugs varied depending on the patients' state. However non significant difference was noted in the average hourly drug consumption between the two interventions. Apart from one circulatory arrest during induction, in one patient with hemorrhagic shock, no death was attributable to the anesthetic technique. The authors, using these findings, attempt to pick out a practical line of behaviour.\n",
      "[Peroperative resuscitation in abdominal reoperations]. Resuscitation of these patients during operation is the only the logical continuation of their preparation. The authors therefore take up the preceding points while emphasizing: - checking vascular filling, by central venous pressure and hourly diuresis; - the necessity for a supply of carbohydrates, which is even more indispensable when the subjects were submitted to parenteral hyperalimentation previously; - the advantages of performing arterial blood gases in order to check artificial ventilation.\n",

The authors analyzed a series of 100 patients who had undergone a total of 143 reinterventions and found respiratory manifestations in 86 cases. They emphasized the frequency of functional respiratory failure and studied the course of different clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters. The second part is concerned with the physiopathological mechanisms, recalling the main causes of postoperative hypoxemia. Finally the therapeutic chapter is centered on the chronology and modalities of artificial ventilation.\n",

Analysis of the problems with infection in a series of 104 reinterventions, enables one to accentuate the importance of infestation from intraperitoneal foci (70 p. 100 of the cases). Extra-peritoneal entry pathways are difficult to prove. Septicemia is found in one out of every three cases. In certain cases, preventive treatment of the extra-peritoneal entry pathways must be opposed to the effectiveness of the surgical act in the eradication of septic foci.\n",
      "[Nutrition in the surgical patient with complications]. Parenteral feeding in complicated abdominal surgery has been a definite therapeutic progress. However the authors emphasize the divergent attitudes concerning the amounts of nitrogen which should be supplied as well as the variations in the calories-nitrogen ratio.

Out of 1,500 laparotomies carried out between january 1970 and december 1973, 49 patients, i.e. 3.2 p. 100 underwent 61 reinterventions: one out of three patients died. Almost 60 p. 100 of these patients who had undergone operations had essentially parietal complications.

      "[Respiratory signs of surgical complications after abdominal operations]. The authors present 29 cases of post-operative respiratory complications in abdominal surgery in subjects without any past history of respiratory disorders. They stress the diagnostic value of these cases of acute respiratory failure shown in a third of the cases of surgical complications.\n",
      "[Medico-surgical evaluation of 71 reoperations in abdominal surgery]. The authors thoroughly checked 71 reinterventions in abdominal surgery. They again found the importance of the factor of infection, respiratory, complications and oligoanuria.

The authors compared three groups of subjects: - the first group (11 patients) : re-operated for post-operative peritonitis; - the second group (6 patients) : re-operated for evisceration without any underlying lesion; - the third group (8 patients) : non-reoperated, complicated abdominal surgery. Study of the different laboratory parameters helped to identify a number of changes which could plead in favor of reintervention, in the group of peritonitis. Among these modifications, the progressive fall in the urinary Na/K ratio and the negativity of the nitrogen balance appear to play a privileged role.\n",

      "[Demythification of acupunctural anesthesia]. The so-called method of acupuncture anesthesia uses a series of techniques: selection of patients, psychotherapy, premedication, adjuvants (morphinomimetics, local anesthetics), choice of points (very varied) whose specificity has not been demonstrated, mechanical or electrical stimulation (with very differents depending on the \"schools\". The effects of these procedures are inconstant. They are slowly established. At best, they are manifested by a hypo-esthesia which is more or less wide-spread and is not accompanied by any \"anti-reflex\" protection. The action of the organism's different functions is not known in detail. There are no statistical studies in the strict sense of the term, in man. It can be roughly estimated that out of 100 surgical patients chosen, about 30 undergo the intervention in acceptable conditions in the western world. The cases, although nothing is concealed in Hanoï as well as in Peking, are difficult, and should only be handled by experienced anesthetists-resuscitators, with knowledge of acupuncture. Certain of the method's advantages only appear in comparison with bad \"chemical\" anesthesia (atoxicity, simplicity, economy), others are practically investions (anallergic effects, anti-infections, anti-shock) or at least abuse of language. The disadvantages apart from the inconstancy of effectiveness, the absence of \"protection\", the duration of induction, consist of lack of standardization of techniques, difficulties of animal experiments and the lack of rational explanation of the mechanism of action.\n",
      "[Study of the effects of Alfatesin on cerebral blood flow in cats]. The cerebral haemodynamic effects of CT 1341 also called Alfatesin, an anaesthetic steroid, were studied in the cat by means of the Xenon 133 isotopic clearance method to measure the cerebral blood flow. The injection or intravenous drip of Alfatesin in animals whose arterio PCO2 was kept unchanged induced a cerebral blood flow diminution, the importance of which was proportional to the injected dose. The cerebral blood flow fall was partly due to a cerebral arterio vasoconstriction evidenced by direct observation of the cortex vessels and by a diminution of the intracranial presure. During a deep anaesthesia induced by Alfatesin with recurrent burst suppression, there was a loss of cerebral blood flow autoregulation while the CO2 cerebral vascular reactivity was maintained. This last result accounts for the increase in cerebral blood flow parallel to the hypercapnia that could be observed among animals breathing freely.\n",
      "[Effects of Alfatesin on total cerebral blood flow in humans]. The total cerebral blood flow was measured by the Xe 133 in 9 patients, before and during a pure Alfatesine induced anaesthesia. With a perfusion flow of 0,04 ml/kg/mn, the total flow underwent a mean fall of 38 p. 100 that was linked neither to any systemic pressure variations nor to variations of the PaCO2. This fall was linked to a cerebral arterio vasoconstriction as it was evidenced by arteriographic images.\n",
      "[Study of pressor drops during continuous peridural analgesia in gerontologic surgery]. A statistical study bearing upon othe fall of blood pressure concomitant with the setting of peridural anaesthesia was carried out upon an homogeneous series of patients over 75 belonging to groups III and IV of the A S A classification for interventions seating below the IXth metamere. From this study, it seems to follow that: - for starting maximum arterial tensions over 180 mm/Hg, pressure falls are virtually constant in absolute value; - the most important variations in pressure falls are to be found in abdominal surgery; - the lowest figure in blood pressure which accompanies the achievement of surgical analgesia takes place about the 24 th minute whatever the type of surgery can be; - no significant link can be evidence between the importance of the fall in blood pressure and the consumption of the mixture required for surgical analgesia.\n",
      "[Harzard of chronic exposure to halothane for operating room personnel]. This study shows that the staff working in an operating room is repeatedly being exposed to appreciable doses of halothane vapours. A continuous measurement of the concentrations in the ambient air gave results ranging from 5 to 30 ppm. Summits from 50 to 70 ppm were noted. The inhaling of halothane was evidenced by the presence of brominated metabolites in the urine of the staff. A mean 14,59 mg/l was found with women anaesthesists. Therefore it is quite possible that the halothane spread in the air should be held responsible for the discomfort felt in particular by anaesthesists. To prevent this risk of chronic intoxication by those vapours, there ought to be a device permitting either to evacuate them outside or to collect them while regenerating the polluted air through an active carbon filter if one has not got at one's disposal an airing system offering over 20 renewals of fresh air per hour. The fitting up of a permanent control device equipped with warning light and bell is also justified.\n",

      "[Helicopters and medical first aid units. Role of Medical First Aid Unit 94]. For the transport of injured and sick patients, the helicopter (even the mono-turbine type) offers greater advantages when compared to land vehicles: - more comfort (less vibrations, accelerations and decelerations); - a greater speed, that is to say a 61 p. 100 gain of time upon the distance and a gain from 29 up to 44 p. 100 upon the total amount of time taken up by each transport. This gain in time enables valuable specialised medical teams to be more available: - more precise time-tables than by land which namely makes it easier to receive the patients. The drawbacks are linked with the risks which are not nonexistent but rather less serious than by land. The drawbacks also depend upon the weather-conditions (although this factor does not matter much in our area), upon nuisances such as the noise (which is more important but far more transitory than by ambulance) and chiefly upon the cost of air-transport. In fact, the mean cost of a medical land transport amounts roughly to one thousand Francs, a quarter of which only does represent the actual cost of medical aid. For a similar transport, the helicopter comes to a 47 mns flight. There are several ways of making good use of a helicopter. Practical problems have been solved. The \"SAMU 94\" experience goes back to 1973 and includes over 500 transports by helicopter essentially with the help of the teams and the helicopters belonging to the Paris Base (Civil Protection and the Fire-Brigade). For flights over urban areas, it is to be desired in the future that only twin-turbine helicopters should be used.\n",
      "[Clinical and therapeutic problems posed by hangings. Apropos of 67 cases]. Starting from a collection of 67 cases of hanging taken over by the Anesthesia Resuscitation Department belonging to Reims Hospital University Centre, the authors report their clinical observations and make an analytical confrontation of this type of accident according to various criteria such as: - the initial physical condition of the victims; - the evolution of the symptoms; - the various medical treatments used. The immediate consequences of miscarried hangings lead to a physio-pathological argument dealing mainly with the neurological and breathing manifestations. The elements of this argument enable the writers to back up certain therapeutic orientations among which hyperbaric oxygen therapy and early prescription of which seems to be wished for in the most severe forms of hanging.\n",

The authors report 4 observations of severe involvement induced by sub-clavian catheterization: - 2 catheter-embolisms; - 1 venous thrombosis and one hydrothoraxx.

It is a matter of eraly oligoanuria (starting beween the 2nd and the 4th day). Its severity depends on the lesions involved : prolonged cardio-vascular collapse - cranio-encephalic lesion. The renal insufficiency does not seem typical of fat embolism. It must be essentially linked to a cardio-vascular collapse and/or to a disseminated intra-vascular coagulation.\n",
      "[Effects of nasogastric intubation on respiratory resistance and work in newborn and premature infants]. The nasal resistance participates for almost 50 p. 100 in the resistance of airways (RVA) of the new-borns whose respiration is mainly nasal. The possibility of an oral respiration in case of partial or total occlusion of nasal way is almost null. In order to determinate the effects of a naso-gastric suction of the RVA 10 normal infants (3 prematures, 7 new-born babies) were studied by plethysmographia. The presence of the suction brought a systematic and significant increase of RVA (the coefficient of transformation = 1,318 +/- 0,21 p is less than 0,001). In the nine infants for whom the resistant work (WR) was estimated is increased proportionaly to the increase of RVA (deltaRVA) (coef. of transformation = 1,44 +/- 0,44, p is less than 0,001). However the proportional increase of WR is not systematic superior for 3 prematures and 1 new-born baby and similar in one case. These variations can be explained by various adjustments of the V. The increase of work imposed by the presence of a naso-gastric suction cannot be underestimated in particular for the prematures.\n",
      "[Treatment of severe forms of idiopathic respiratory distress in newborn infants using constant negative perithoracic pressure]. 49 children with a severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome were treated by continuous negative pressure ranging from 5 cm of water to a negative pressure of 13 cm of water around the thorax. The partial pressure of oxygen rose significantly in the majority of cases, and the alveolo-arterial gradient also significantly diminished by more than 100 mm of mercury. 29 children were treated by this method alone, but in 20 other children owing to the failure of constant negative pressure, respiratory assistance either by intermittent pressure ventilation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation was associated. On the whole 35 out of 49 children survived. The complications which were met with are analyzed. Continuous negative pressure seems to be a safe and effective method for improving oxygenation in the idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome.\n",

PAH clearance was carried out in 12 newborns, hospitalized in the infantile resuscitation unit for respiratory distress. 6 of these children weighed less than 2.5 kg, 4 had hyaline membrane disease, 6 had either amniotic abnormalities or transitory tachypnea, 2 were surgical patients: one right diaphragmatic hernia, one post-operative respiratory complication after intervention for neonatal occlusion. In 9 cases the newborn was under controled artificial ventilation associated with PEEP at 5 to 7 cm of water. In all of the cases, the hemodynamic, metabolic and blood gas conditions were normal. A control series of 11 newnorn was carried out in a pediatric unit, the clearance was done without urine samples, the rough value of the figures found varied from 5.5 ml per minute to 30 ml per minute in the respiratory distress series and 16 to 62 ml per minute in the control series. The analysis of these results in rendered difficult by the juxtaposition of several factors: Choice of a reference criterion: body surface area, PAH space, patient's weight theoretical weight of the kidneys. The factor of prematurity. The problem of the date of the investigation in comparison with the date of birth.\n",
      "[Transport of \"high-risk\" newborn infants. (Apropos of 159 emergency calls by the SAMU 94-Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente-Emergency Health Service)]. Analysis of our experience confirms in the domain of the newborn the fundamental notion of the Emergency medical call. The EMC has two objectives: 1--Emergency treatment before the patient is moved, and the correction of failing vital functions by a medical team skilled in problems of neonates. 2--Transportation of the neonate in a stable condition, to the Intensive Care unit. The quality of such transportation depends closely upon the quality of the medical care given and upon organisation. It can only be carried out in the context of a system coordinated by a \"coordinating physician\" (e.g. SAMU 94). This coordinating physician has responsibility for logistics, telephone coordination, and application of the call procedure as rapidly as possible. From a logistical point of view, only coordination between:--SAMU-SMUR;--Medical team of the Intensive care unit;--Requesting service make possible the provision and quality of continuous supplies of oxygen, warmth, sugar - all under aseptic conditions, indispensable to the quality of survival of the neonate. In addition, we feel it essential--that the delay before the call is answered be as brief as possible;--that the call should be dealt with by a mixed team, including at least one physician experienced in neonatal problems;--that the choice of vehicle used for transportation should be better adapted to the situation. This choice is the responsibility of the coordinating physician, who should base his decisions on two fundamental requirements:--rapidity of dealing with the call;--personal safety of those involved. This without losing sight of--Prevention of perinatal problems lies part with the detection of high risk pregnancies, with the aim of arranging delivery in specialised \"mother and baby\" centres where close collaboration between obstetrician and paediatrician is assured.--The development of transportation of the \"high-risk\" neonate, which is so costly in manpower and equipment, depends closely upon general concepts of health care in France, which should be aimed at:--the prevention of prematury;--the detection of high risk pregnancies;--the development of mother and baby centres.\n",

On arrival, from the mean values, the temperature was 25.2 degrees, the pH 7.28, the pO2 112, the blood sugar 1.53 g.Three practical conclusions must be drawn: reserve high risk deliveries for specialized centers, when the degree of emergency compells delivery in a badly equipped center, contact the SAMU from the beginning of labour, render the actions carried out by the transporting doctor even more rigorous and controled, which implies an organized SMUR which is well equipped and trained.\n",
      "[Vascular and infectious enteropathy in newborn infants. Reflections on pathogeny; clinical and therapeutic deductions. Apropos of 45 cases]. Necrotizing enterocolitis of the new-born has an anatomical definition: lesions discovered during surgery or on post-mortem examination. Progress in neanatal shock reveals facts already known in the adult and in experimental medicine: concept of preferential and circulatory by-pass. A considerable decrease in blood flow is seen in the latter during shock; this shock is sometimes not important. Mesenteric circulation is the best example. This syndrome should therefore be included in the major vascular changes of neonatal period. Vascular and infectious enteropathy is a broader term which seems more appropriate because of aetiological and therapeutic implications. The aetiology should be considered as a sum of several factors varying from one patient to another (multifactorial disease). The circulatory component remains very important. Its severity depends on whether or not it is treated. Four notions should be defined: -- Census of population of subjects with \"high risk\" of vascular and infectious enteropathy (score trial); -- Isolation of clinical pictures corresponding to a medical or surgical stage; Grouping of elements for immediate and long term prognosis; -- Grouping of elements for immediate and long term prognosis; -- Proposal of preventive treatment to the \"high risk\" patients (surgery; continuons parenteral and enteral feeding are intientionally left out in this paper). The interest of this concept of the disease is to eradicate severe forms as in the neonatal idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome where a similar concept was adopted.\n",

Respect of these rules in diaphragmatic hernias saved 12 lives out of 23; in oesophageal atresias, 16 survived out of 16 cases classified as good cases, and the total survival rate was 73%.\n",
      "[Congenital cardiopathies appearing during the neonatal period. The view points of the cardiologist, the hemodynamics specialist, the surgeon, and the anesthetist]. The best chances of survival for a new-born depend on the following factors: the possibility of clinical and haemodynamic diagnosis of the malformation, adequate reanimation and surgery. All this must be carried out as early as possible. Although catheterization is very risky it should be complete and as fast as possible, under monitoring of ventilation and haemodynamies. Reanimation is very important before, during and after surgery; it should be more preventive than curative. Very often, surgery is only palliative at this age. Taking into account progress in surgical techniques, the authors report their experience in anaesthesia and ressuscitation of 100 patients under 10 days old. They were all operated on in Laennec in Professor MATHEY's department but only some of them were catheterized there.\n",
      "[Leukomalacia and subsequent brain status in relation to intensive neonatal care]. Leucomalacia or white matter necrosis is one of the major aspects of neonatal encephalopathies, especially in the premature baby. These necroses are found mainly in the deep periventricular white matter of the \"semi-oval centre\". Characteristically, they are ischaemic and their anatomical and histological progress is rapid: coagulation necrosis with rapid axonal fragmentation followed by polymorphic cellular reaction with glial cells and macrophages. Regeneration in the minor forms consists of glyosis process in severe forms; multiple cavities appear in a few weeks. Physiopathogenic hypotheses put forward are related to: 1 -- the very anatomic aite: special tissue and terminal arteries, 2 -- onset of myelinization process, 3 -- associated clinical and biological lesions such as hypoxia, acidosis and hypotention. These lesions are symptom-free during the neonatal period. One of us suggested in 1962 that these could be the anatomical basis of spastic monoplegia or diplegia (LITTLE's disease). All motor cerebral sequelae have disappeared since 10 years. This is particularly significant mainly in the case of spastic diplegia of the former premature baby under 2500 g. This decrease coincides with improvement in neonatal care, especially correction of hypoxia, acidosis and cardiovascular collapse. These findings seem to support the pathogenic hypotheses.\n",
      "[Neonatal listeriosis (based on 43 cases)]. Using results in 43 cases from two neonatal units (Paris-Tours), the authors emphasize the essential facts concerning neonatal listeriosis. 1 -- Incidence: -- of an infectious maternal disease (32 cases out of 43), -- of permaturity (60% of cases), -- and of foetal distress (72%). 2 -- Clinical study: Early neonatal infectious are the only forms seen; clinical signs appear before the first day (40 out of 42). These is septicaemia with mainly respiratory signs (olypnoea, laboured breathing). Their presence and clinical history should incite to take swabs of the orifices and carry out blood culture. The new-born are given double antibiotherapy (penicline and aninoside or kanamycine and gentalline) while waiting for laboratory reports. This routine treatment based on maternal past history and on mild clinical signs at this stage has improved the prognosis of these septicaemias (16 deaths out of 43 children).\n",
      "[Appearance of coagulation disorders in the non-healthy newborn infant]. Coagulation abnormalities are particularly frequent in neonatal pathology and justify exploration of hemostasis in the newborn. First of all we established a profile of coagulation in the newborn using our own results and data from the literature. Contrasting with a deficit in numerous factors (II - VII - IX - X - XI - and XII), overall coagulation is normal, or even increased. The fibrinolytic system is characterized by a low plasminogen level but the activity of this system is transitorily increased. Then we recall the known syndromes: avitaminosis K, constitutional deficits in the coagulation factors, isolated thrombopenia, disseminated intravascular clotting. However numerous problems persist. Abnormalities in the clotting factors are frequently difficult to interpret. Correlation between the clinical and laboratory pictures does not always exist. We emphasize the necessity for preventive measures.\n",

However, sometimes and most of all, in \"high risk\" cases, this infant needs a correct surveillance before and after the delivery in order to prevent morbidity and especially perinatal morbidity. Our actual knowledge, derived from the fantastic progress of Perinatalogy, demonstrates that, in order to assure the wanted end of the pregnancy, the only assistance of the delivery at hospital by a qualified obstetrician is not enough. It is necessary to have a continuous surveillance at the beginning of the pregnancy and during the pregnancy and a correct attention at the mother - foetus binomial during the labor and the delivery. That will permit the discovery of pre- para and post-natal factors, to undertake the prevention and to lower the number of perinatal mortality.\n",

The increasing use of medications during pregnancy and labour leads to the question of their true effectiveness and the absence of harmful effects, for both mother and foetus. Study of the action of medications given to the pregnant woman requires clinical trials with precise methodology including, as an essential stage, the definition of an experimental protocol. Random distribution of the subjects to the various groups and statistical analysis of the results based upon objective criteria are essential. No study of the action of a medication as far as mother and foetus should be undertaken without prior parmacological and pharmacokinetic trials.\n",
      "[Drug interference and the role of anesthesia in such interference]. This report considers interference between medications for, on the one hand, drugs given during pregnancy, and, on the other hand, drugs given to the pregnant women and anaesthetic agents. Consideration is given to progestational agents, oxytocics, beta-mimetics, corticosteroids, insulin, hypotensive agents, diuretics and psychiatric drugs. For each case of interference, an attempt is made to provide practical data, with particular respect to those combinations frequently prescribed by obstetricians, e.g. the combination of the beta-mimetics and corticosteroids with the aim of preventing impending premature onset of labour and to ensure foetal pulmonary maturation; the combination of insulin and corticosteroids given to diabetics with the aim of preventing hyaline membrane disease; the combination of corticosteroids with anti-histamines in the treatment of rhesus disease; the association of oxytocics with large quantities of intravenous fluid in the case of post-partum haemorrhage and hypontensive medication combinations and the problems which may result with emergency anaesthesis.\n",
      "[Drug heritage of the newborn infant]. The medicamental heritage of the new-born baby is a reality that we are more and more realizing. During intra-uterine life, the foetus is placed under different maternal influences that the new-born baby is done an \"old\" and unsafe one who can present, as early as his birth, modifications of his own metabolism. To know if this heritage is really a dotation or an empoisoned gift, is an important question that we are going to study in light of experimental data and constatations of clinical pharmacology.\n",
      "[Influence on the fetus of drugs taken during pregnancy]. The use of drugs during pregnancy is very common; some substances can provoke in the foetus troubles and anatomical or functional disorders which may be detected either at birth or later on. Then it is necessary the physicians restrict the prescription of therapeutical agents for and only for well-knowned indications. The education of people in regard of this subject is also necessary about drugs used during pregnancy without medical advices.\n",
      "[Evaluation of fetal maturity at birth]. It is very important to evaluate the degree of maturity of a new-born infant in order: - to appreciate the chronological age when the date of the last period is unknown or doubtful, - to compare the degree of maturation with the weight and size of the infant, in regard of estimating the intra-uterine growth and detecting early a lateness or advance of this growth.\n",
      "[Severe respiratory distress with stubborn hypoxemia in newborn infants whose mothers had had placenta previa]. The study of 16 newborn of birthweight less than or equal to 2,200 g characterized by a common point: the presence of PLACENTA PRAEVIA IN THE MOTHER, enabled us to come to grips with the severe respiratory distress that these newborn can have. From the clinical standpoint: there is always early respiratory distress. From the radiological standpoint: by far the most dominant pathology was interstitial edema, giving rise to a WET LUNG. From the biochemical standpoint: the blood gases were characterized in a certain number of cases by hypoxemia which was refractory to the usual forms of treatment. From the mechanical standpoint: measurements carried out in 4 patients confirmed the extraordinary fall in these patients' compliance. The clinical, radiological, blood gas and mechanical analysis enabled one to differenciate 2 main types of indications for artificial ventilation: -- acute hypoxemia, -- the idea of an increased need for oxygen. In these 2 types of indications for artificial ventilation, it was apparent that the treatment of choice is constant positive pressure which may or may not be combined with intermittent positive pressure. With this treatment technique, none of the patients progressed to massive atelectasis. It can be said that with the advent of techniques of ventilation by high pressure combining IPP with CPP, one has definitively eliminated from this pathological picture, the principal cause of death: --anoxia due to massive alveolar collapse.\n",
      "[Primary management of labor using neuroleptic analgesia]. Within the limits granted, neuroleptanalgesia constitutes a very interesting technique in the major part of management of labour. In particular it has the advantage of preserving maternal consciousness. On the other hand, it allows analgesia of rather long duration, which renders early management of labour possible while still respecting its physiology. The institution of this technique demands the presence at the parturients bedside, not only of the obstetrician and the medwife but also that of a qualified anesthetist. As in all cases of major management of labour it engages the responsability of the obstetrical team which undertakes it and this is even more so, the earlier it is started. To us its indications seem comparable with those of Gamma OH: the early management of labour however has the advantage over the latter of preserving maternal consciouness. Moreover it proved to be particularly interesting in the management of breech presentations. But if its properties are an advantage in the indications which we have just mentioned, they can constitute an invonvenience and restrain its use under different circumstances: its slowness of induction, the absence of narcosis which limits the effect on cervical resistance means that one prefers the Toulouse method using pentothal for the management of labour after 7 centimeters of dilatation. In conclusion, it seems important to us to state that neuroleptanalgesia is not the ideal method for management of labour any more than is thiopental or Gamma-OH. Other techniques merit being studied. Their study must obey strict rules in order to specify the risks and therefore the indications and limits. It should cover different fields which are, pharmacology, the objective assessment, by quantitative criteria, of the effects on uterine contraction, on the mother's clinical and biological state as well as that of the fetus in utero, then that of the child in the first hours of live and up to the first years of his development.\n",
      "[Drugs most frequently used during pregnancy and labor and their effects]. It is rather difficult to draw up a list of the drugs most frequently used during pregnancy, and to specify their action on the mother, the uterus ans the fetus bearing in mind the differences between them. This difficulty results in particular from the high number of drugs owing to: the frequency of prescriptions and selfmedication in the pregnant woman who suffers from numerous disorders, and the possibility of a pathology associated with the pregnancy or a pathology due to the pregnancy itself thereby defining the \"high risk\" pregnancy. On this background already modified by pregnancy, under the hold of numerous drugs, an anesthetic can be necessary in addition during labour or delivery, the frequency of which can be estimated as being approximately 20 per cent. It is not possible to study all therapeutic agents in a single communication. One can only evoke the influence of the most currently used drugs; analgesics, antibiotics, diuretics, sleeping tablets, anti-hypertensives and those aimed at the neuropsychiatric system (anti-depression agents, neuroleptics, tranquillizers) which are so frequently used at present. Finally, during labour the number of parturients who receive no drugs is rare: ocytocic and anti-spasmodic agents can also interfere with an anesthetic. All of these ideas which are more and more difficult to acquire are important to know. In fact the person in charge of the delivery must prescribe as little drugs as possible (in order to avoid multiple drug interference which is rather difficult to predict) knowing the possible action of drugs on the fetus (in order to allow best adaptation to life in our atmosphere after delivery) and foreseeing the possible necessity for an anesthetic. In his turn, the anesthetist should have a good knowledge of obstetrical physiology and pathology and the drugs capable of being used during pregnancy and labour in order to be able to choose the best adapted anesthetic. This emphasized the importance of a well integrated obstetrico-anesthetic team in which each member knows the problems of the other, with the aim of being the least possible noxious for the mother, and the future newborn, the fetus. This also emphasizes the necessity for anesthetists attached to the ostetrical unit, knowing like the obstetrician the histories of those women with \"high risk\" pregnancies. Obstetrical anesthetics cannot be improvised.\n",
      "[Important physiological considerations in artificial respiration and reanimation of newborn infants]. The methods used for ventilation of the neonate shold be based upon consideration of the physiological changes which occure in the lungs and circulation at birth of the normal infant. Three important changes must be taken into consideration. The first is the formation of a residual volume of alveolar gas, the second the resorption of pulmonary fluid and the third a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, upon which is dependent the change from foetal circulation to that of the neonate. To begin insufflation of foetal lungs it is necessary to use a pressure of between 20 and 30 cm H2O. After the first insufflation, a good deal of air remains in the lungs, even during expiration, as long as pulmonary \"surfactant\" is present. In the absence of the latter, residual pressure at the end of expiration is necessary in order to avoid the lung emptying itself of air. The resorption of pulmonary liquid from the alveolar spaces into the blood is dependent upon a change in the permeability of the alveolar epithelium, which renders possible the rapid passage of water via the channels which open, probably between the epithelial cells, and this change is dependent upon an expansion of the lungs by a pressure of between 35 and 40 cm H2O. Dilatation of the pulmonary vessels depends in part upon an increase in partial pressure of oxygen and a fall in carbon dioxide in the environment of the pulmonary arterioles, and in part upon mechanical changes brought about by the movements of ventilatation.\n",
      "[Spectrofluorometric determination of a new beta-blocking agent, acebutolol in blood and urine]. The authors describe a simple method of spectrofluorimetric estimation of acebutolol, applicable to blood and urine, sufficiently sensitive to obtain therapeutic concentrations. After administration of a 200 mg dose by mouth, one may observe a maximal plasma concentration 3 hours later, with average values of 1.02 +/- 0.20 mg/liter. The principle of the estimation is based on acid hydrolysis of the product, then condensation of the liberated amine with nitroso-1 naphtol-2 to give a fluorescent derivative (stimulation 460 nm, emission 545 nm).\n",
      "[Determination of the activity of serum ornithine carbamoyltranferase : working conditions in a veronal-acetate medium]. Ornithine carbamyl transferase activity was determined by estimation of the citrulline formed during the reaction. Citrulline is estimated by diacetylmonoxime in the presence of thiosemicarbazide. The conditions of enzyme analysis were then studied in buffer veronal-acetate medium at 37 degrees C. The optimum pH for activity depended on the ornithine concentration, but was independent of carbamyl-phosphate concentration. At pH 7.8, ornithine at concentrations higher than 1.6 mM inhibited enzyme activity, ornithine Km was 0.208 mM and that of carbamyl-phosphate was 1.92 mM. The incubation time for determination of OCT activity was 15 minutes. Citrulline production was proportional to the enzyme concentration up to activities of 180 units/l. Serum urea was destroyed by a urease of high quality, so that the formation of citrulline in the control reagents was minimal. Reference values, determined on a hospital population, without liver, heart or pulmonary disease, lay between 4.7 +/- 2.3 units/l. The coefficient of variation of the technique, determined on a pool of serum of moderate activity was 8 units/l i.e. 5.1 per cent.\n",
      "Comparison of anileridine and pethidine in preventing pain responses during nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia. The analgesic potency of anileridine and pethidine was compared in 28 patients by measuring their effect on withdrawal movements caused by pinching of the skin or by surgery during N2O + O2 anaesthesia. It appeared that anileridine is 3.5 to 4 times as potent as pethidine on a weight basis. In equianalgesic doses the incidence of side effects was equal after both drugs.\n",
      "Effects of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol in angina pectoris. A subacute study with exercise tests. The effects of the cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol, were evaluated under double-blind conditions in eighteen patients with angina pectoris. During an introductory run-in period of eight weeks, a placebo was given single-blindly. Thereafter two double-blind crossover periods each of four weeks followed, either 20 mg metroprolol or placebo being given t.i.d. Metoprolol gave a significant reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption. The patients' subjective assessments of their daily angina pectoris symptoms also showed a significant improvement compared with the placebo. At the end of each period, a standardized exercise test was performed. In comparison with placebo, metoprolol gave a significant increase of total work performed until the appearance of 1 mm ST-segment depression and until the end of exercise. The heart rate was significantly reduced at rest and during exercise. The blood pressure was significantly reduced only during exercise. None of the patients reported any severe unwanted effects. The complaints reported were mild to moderate, and the frequency during metoprolol treatment was even lower than during placebo treatment. No signs or symptoms of cardiac failure were seen in any of these patients on any occasion. It is concluded that 20 mg metoprolol t.i.d. is of benefit in the treatment of angina pectoris but further benefit might be obtained with higher doses.\n",
      "[Effect of the phosphorus concentration on novobiocin formation by the producer Act. spheroides]. According to the literature data biosynthesis of novobiocin by Act. spheroides unlike other antibiotics does not practically depend on the phosphorus levels in the medium. In the present paper it is shown that production of novobiocin in natural media is sensitive to the concentration of mineral phosphorus in the medium. The optimal concentration of phosphorus for biosynthesis of novobiocin is almost within the same ranges as that for biosynthesis of streptomycin, tetracyclines and oleandomycin.\n",
      "[Microbiological study of gentamiycin]. Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.\n",
      "[Use of lincomycin, methicillin and ristomycin in the nutrient media for isolating pathogenic intestinal microorganisms]. Elective-differentiating solid nutrient media for simultaneous isolation of Vibrioes, Salmonella and Shigella were developed.

The medium was lincomycin and the bile salts may be prepared in a dry form.\n",
      "[Characteristics of the oxidative metabolism in strains with varying levels of fucidin biosynthesis]. Oxidative capacity of the fusidin-producing strains with various biosynthetic activity was studied comparatively. The studies showed that by their capacity to oxidize pyruvate and some metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (acetate, succinate, malate) the strains were arranged in the order reverse to their antibiotic activity. Such regularity was observed during the whole fermentation process and was most pronounced by the 3rd and 4th days (beginning of the idiophase). The rate of glucose oxidation was higher in more active strains. The same regularity was noted in the 2nd phase of the strain development associated with beginning of fusidin biosynthesis. In the 1st phase (the 1st and 2nd days) the strains almost did not differ by their capacity to oxidize glucose. By oxidation of phosphorylated ethers of carbohydrates (glucose-6-phosphate and fructoso-6-phosphate) the strains did not differ. Various fusidin-producing strains oxidized NAD-N and NADP-N approximately with the same rate. It is supposed that mutations leading to increased antibiotic production are associated with changes in acetate metabolism in the direction of more intensive biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds, potential precursors of the fusidin molecule.\n",
      "Lactulose therapy in Shigella carrier state and acute dysentery. Antibiotic-resistant shigella are increasingly prevalent. Lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide, was investigated as an alternative therapy for shigella infection on the hypothesis that the short-chain fatty acids (inhibitory to shigella) resulting from metabolism of lactulose by normal colonic flora would diminish shigella excretion. A long-term antibiotic-refractory carrier (large bowel) excreting 10(4) to 10(7)Shigella sonnei/g of feces was given two courses of lactulose (of 24 and 16 days duration). During lactulose therapy, excretion of shigella was greatly diminished (24-day course) or suppressed below detectable levels (16-day course), but returned to pretreatment levels upon discontinuation of lactulose. The volunteers who developed induced shigellosis during an efficacy test of oral Shigella flexneri 2a vaccine were randomly given oral ampicillin, lactulose, or placebo in double-blind fashion. Daily rectal cultures were taken. After 4 days of therapy, cultures were still positive in four out of four men on lactulose, three of three on placebo and none of three on ampicillin. Mean stool pH of men receiving lactulose (6.1) was significantly lower than those getting ampicillin (7.4), P &lt; 0.01, or placebo (7.0), P &lt; 0.05. Only in the lactulose group was mean stool pH during therapy significantly decreased compared with the level off therapy (6.1 versus 7.1), P &lt; 0.02. Lactulose shows promise for the treatment of shigella carriers but appears ineffective in treatment of acute shigellosis.\n",
      "Antimicrobial effect of simple lipids and the effect of pH and positive ions. Various branched fatty acids, particularly those of iso-configuration, have been shown to possess fungistatic and bacteriostatic properties. On the basis of their swelling effect on hyphae of Fusarium roseum it was suggested that this is due to an increase in the permeability of the plasma membrane. The solubilization of fatty acids in membranes should be expected to be influenced by the degree of dissociation and the presence of counter ions. Therefore, the effects of pH and K(+), Na(+), and Ca(2+) ions were studied. It is demonstrated that the presence of the univalent ions, Na(+) and K(+), markedly enhances the fungistatic effect of iso-tetradecanoic acid, whereas the opposite effect is noted for the divalent ion, Ca(2+). The effects are particularly pronounced at high pH. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect obtained from the combination of fatty acid and tetramethylthiuramdisulfide is significantly enhanced in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2% KCl.\n",
      "Regulation of citrate synthase activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Citrate synthase activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined by a radioactive assay procedure and the reaction product, 14C-citric acid, was identified by chromatographic techniques. ATP, d-ATP, GTP and NADH were most inhibitory to the citrate synthase invitro. The activity was inhibited to a lesser extent by ADP, UTP, and NADP whereas, AMP and CTP were much less inhibitory. NADH, like NAD, glutamic acid, glutamine, arginine, ornithine, proline, aspartic acid and alpha-ketoglutarate exhibited no inhibition. These results have been discussed in the light of the role of citrate synthase for the energy metabolism and glutamic acid biosynthesis.\n",
      "Role of acetate metabolism in sporulation of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis. Several aspects of the role of acetate metabolism in the sporulation of Saccaromyces carlsbergensis were investigated. Experiments in which the development of the respiratory system was either stimulated by growth on sugars to which the cells have to adapt, or inhibited by chloramphenicol suggested a correlation between respiratory development and sporulation. In cells in which the respiratory system has been repressed during growth, mitobhondrial protein synthesis and derepression are prerequisites for sporulation. When derepression is complete, sporulation no longer depends on mitochondrial protein synthesis. Incorporation experiments with acetate showed that this compound is an important source of intermediates for biosynthetic processes that occur during sporulation. Its incorporation into macromolecular fractions is tightly coupled to sporutlation.\n",
      "Bacterial and fungal growth in total parenteral nutrition solutions,. The most serious complication of prolonged intravenous infusion of hypertonic dextrose and amino acids is infection. Frequently, the etiology is fungal rather than bacterial. Previous authors have suggested that bacterial survival and growth in the solutions is suppressed by (a) high dextrose concentration, (b) high osmolality, or (c) low pH. This paper presents evidence that proposals (a) and (b) are untenable and (c) is only partly responsible. We call attention to the presence of a factor that is antibacterial but not antifungal; namely, a high concentration of glycine.\n",
      "New medium for isolating iron-oxidizing and heterotrophic acidophilic bacteria from acid mine drainage. A new solid medium is described for growing iron and heterotrophic bacteria from acid mine drainage (AMD). Examination of AMD from five states revealed several kinds of colonies of iron-oxidizing bacteria: (i) smooth, (ii) smooth with secondary growth sectors or branching, (iii) star-shaped, (iv) radiating lobe, and (v) flat-rough. All AMD samples yielded whitish colonies that could not use ferrous iron, sulfur, or hydrogen, nor could they grow on nutrient agar, brain heart infusion agar, or Trypticase soy agar. Glucose and sucrose supported growth if the sugar-salts medium was at pH 3.0. The new iron medium has several advantages over others: (i) easy preparation, (ii) rapid growth, (iii) larger colonies, (iv) differentiation of colony morphology, and (v) detection of a new group of heterotrophic acidophilic bacteria.\n",
      "Effect of initial pH on aflatoxin production. The effect of initial pH on aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus NRRL 2999 was examined in a semisynthetic medium. Maximal growth, aflatoxin production, and aflatoxin production per unit of growth occurred at initial pH levels of 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 respectively. Initial pH levels less than pH 6.0 favored production of the B toxins, whereas levels greater than pH 6.0 favored production of the G toxins.\n",
      "High-temperature production of protein-enriched feed from cassava by fungi. A simple, nonaseptic, low-cast process for the conversion of cassava, a starchy tropical root crop, into microbial protein for use as animal feed was sought. Screening tests culminated in the isolation of a thermotolerant, amylase-producing mold, designated I-21, which was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus. The optimum pH for protein synthesis was 3-5, but the optimum temperature was less than the desired temperature (larger than or equal to 45 C) required for a nonaseptic fermentation. A. fumigatus I-21 and its asporogenous mutant I-21A grew equally well in a medium prepared from whole cassava roots with a mean protein doubling time at 45 C and pH 3.5 of 3.5 h. In batch culture, approximately 4% carbohydrate, supplied as whole cassava, could be feremented in 20 h, giving a final yield of 24 g of dry product, containing 36.9% crude protein, per liter. The conversion of carbohydrate used to crude protein was 22.1%. When determined as amino acids, the protein content of the product, which contained cassava bark and other unfermented residues, was 27.1%. With urea as the nitrogen source, no pH control was necessary. Preliminary data indicated that medium prepared from whole cassava roots was inhibitory to the mold unless the cassava pulp was heated to 70 C immediately after being ground. Heating to 70 C was required to gelatinize the starch and permit its complete utilization.\n",
      "Removal of algae from Florida lakes by magnetic filtration. Magnetic filtration was used for the removal of algal populations present in five lakes located in the vicinity of Gainesville, Fla. It was found that the use of this technique enabled a good removal (94%) of algal cells from three lakes where the pH was around 7. The other two lakes, with a higher pH, displayed a lower removal. However, the treatment was greatly improved by lowering the pH from 9.5 to 6.5.\n",
      "Factors influencing detection and enumeration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by most-probable-number and membrane filtration techniques. Most-probable-number (MPN) and membrane filtration (mF) techniques were evaluated with respect to selectivity, sensitivity, and efficiency in recovering Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in hospital fluids and extramural water environments. Known numbers of cells of a naturally occurring strain of P. aeruginosa maintained in distilled water or cells subcultured on Standard Methods agar were added to test samples containing various types and levels of background microbial contamiants. Environmental samples containing unknown numbers of P. aeruginosa strains also were tested. Asparagine and acetamide broths were employed as presumptive media in MPN tests, and mPA and Pseudosel agars were used in mF assays. Statistical analyses of data showed the superiority and comparability of the asparagine-MPN and mPA-mF systems. Greater precision and accuracy were consistently obtained in either assay technique by the use of naturally occurring cells as test organisms. The type of filter and nature of diluents employed, as well as pH of assay media, were found to greatly influence both recovery and developemnt of characteristic colonial morphology in the mPA-mF system.\n",
      "Heat resistance of ileal loop reactive Bacillus cereus strains isolated from commercially canned food. Sporeformers isolated from a commercially canned food were identified as Bacillus cereus, lactose-positive variants. The thermal resistance of spore crops produced from each of two representative cultures was determined in 0.067 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The D121.1 values for one isolate were approximately 0.03 min (z = 9.9C), whereas the D121.1 values for the other isolate were 2.35 min (z = 7.9 C). Thermal inactivation results for heat-stressed isolates from each strain showed no significant alteration in heat resistance from that of the two parent spore crops. Both isolates were reactive when injected into the ligated rabbit ileum.\n",
      "Kinetics of a bacterial culture growth: validity of the affinity rule in biological systems. The kinetic study of a process is usually performed by measuring a convenient intensive property, P, as a function of time. The \"affinity rule\" states that, when a given process takes place under different external constraints (e.g., different temperatures, pressures, pH values, etc.), the various P versus time curves are related by an affinity transformation parallel to the time axis: in other words the P versus log time curves are parallel and can be superimposed by translation. The validity of the rule has been extensively tested in chemical and physiochemical processes, but there is no evidence as yet that it extends to biological systems. The present paper shows that the rule is indeed valid for the kinetics of growth of an Escherichia coli culture at various temperatures and pH values. More extended experiments are necessary to prove or disprove the general validity of the rule in biological systems, but its practical interest is evident: whenever it is valid it will be possible, from a very small number of measurements, to predict the complete behavior of the system in a number of various external conditions\n",
      "Beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol in treatment of hay fever in children. Eighteen children suffering from hay fever were treated with intra-nasal beclomethasone dipropionate (400 mug/day) and an identical placebo aerosol in a double-blind cross-over trial. 17 of the children preferred the intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate, one had no preference, none preferred the placebo. The effect on the nasal symptoms was impressive. Symptom scores decreased, on average, to 12% and the number of antihistamine tablets taken to 18% of the pretreatment amount. Some beneficial effect on eye symptoms was also discernible, possibly due to an indirect influence from the nasal mucosa via the nasolacrimal reflex. Adrenal function was not affected. It was concluded that 400 mug beclomethasone dipropionate given intranasally daily for some weeks is an effective and safe treatment for hay fever in children.\n",
      "The influence of oxyhemoglobin affinity on tissue oxygen consumption. In an intact animal or patient, any shift in oxyhemoglobin affinity is inevitably associated with concurrent fluctuation in numerous other determinants of oxygen delivery. For this reason, the influence of hemoglobin affinity for oxygen on tissue oxygen consumption has been incompletely evaluated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of oxyhemoglobin affinity as the sole variable of oxygen delivery in an isolated perfused canine hindlimb. A membrane lung system which allowed precise control of blood flow, temperature, arterial oxygen content and arterial pH was established. Twelve isolated canine hindlimbs were alternatively perfused with autologous stored (left-shifted)  and fresh (right-shifted) blood in paralled perfusion systems. The 2,3-DPG concentrations, P50 and oxygen consumptions were significantly different in the two paralled perfusion systems. A decreased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen appeared to permit increased oxygen off-loading at the tissue level.\n",
      "The relationship between muscle surface pH and oxygen transport. The relationship between muscle surface pH (pHM) and the arterial-venous oxygen content difference (AVO2D) was studied in 4 patients undergoing reconstructive arterial surgery and in 6 patients undergoing acute normovolemic hemodilution. There was a consistent inverse relation between pHM in the ischemic lower extremity and the femoral AVO2D before, during and after aortic clamping. There was also an inverse relation between AVO2D and pHM during hemodilution. These data confirm that pHM is a reliable indicator of tissue perfusion and correlates with the AVO2D.\n",
      "Sodium nitroprusside as a coronary vasodilator in man: a comparison of the effects of sodium nitroprusside and papaverine hydrochloride on aortocoronary saphenous vein graft flow. Blood flow in aortocoronary saphenous vein grafts was studied in response to intragraft injection of sodium nitroprusside and papaverine hydrochloride. Following injection of 50 mug of sodium nitroprusside, mean graft flow increased from 40.1 +/- 4.5 to 81.3 +/- 8.5 ml per minute. Administration of 30 mg of papaverine hydrochloride caused mean graft flow to rise from 35.4 +/- 3.9 to 70 +/- 7.9 ml per minute. Sodium nitroprusside increases aortocoronary graft flow, the doubling effect of 50 mug of the drug being of the same order of magnitude as that induced by 30 mg of papaverine hydrochloride.\n",
      "Comparative evaluation of a new disposable rotating membrane oxygenator with bubble oxygenator. The comparative in vivo performance of adult-size bubble and rotating membrane oxygenators was evaluated during closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass for six hours in two groups of dogs. The results show that the rotating membrane oxygenator is efficient in oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer with minimal trauma to blood, while platelet destruction and hemolysis were marked with the bubble oxygenator. Cerebral, cardiac, and respiratory complications were frequent with the bubble oxygenator and absent with the membrane oxygenator.\n",
      "Adrenergic drug-receptor interaction in the presence of strontium (Sr++) in mammalian myocardium. The specificity of Ca++ for the interaction of beta adrenergic agonists with their receptors in rabbit right atrial muscle was evaluated. This was accomplished by substituting Ca++ by an equimolar concentration of Sr++. Dose-response curves which demonstrate the effect of norepinephrine and isoproterenol on the rate of electrical activity in the presence of Ca++ or Sr++ were made. In addition, the antagonistic action of propranolol (1 X 10(-7) M) in a Ca++-containing or Sr++-containing medium was determined. The results clearly demonstrate that Sr++ can effectively substitute for Ca++ in maintaining electrical and mechanical activity in cardiac muscle. Also, norepinephrine and isoproterenol can increase the rate of electrical activity in a Ca++ or Sr++-containing medium. This effect of these beta agonists is mediated through the beta-receptors since propranolol effectively blocked their action. It appears that Ca++ per se is not required for beta agonist or antagonist-receptor interaction in cardiac muscle. The results are discussed in relation to the dependency on extracellular Ca++ for beta agonists to cause a change in the rate of electrical activity after receptor occupancy.\n",
      "Effects of isoprenaline and phenylephrine on plasma potassium: role of the liver. A dog liver preparation in situ was used. Intravenous infusion of isoprenaline caused a decrease of plasma potassium levels, which was preceded, in some of the animals infused with higher doses, by a rise in plasma potassium. Propranolol abolished both these effects of isoprenaline, whereas phentolamine was devoided of effects. Liver potassium was not affected by isoprenaline infusions. Phenylephrine caused release of potassium from the liver; this effect was blocked by phentolamine, but not by propranolol. Combination of phenylephrine and isoprenaline induced a super-additive hyperkalemia. Analysis of these results led to the conclusion that the rise in plasma potassium due to phenylephrine might reflect a direct kalemotropic effect and an indirect hypoxemic effect. Isoprenaline seems to increase the hypoxemia caused by phenylephrine by opening the intrahepatic vascular shunts.\n",
      "Benzodiazepines and amphetamine on avoidance behaviour in mice. Six benzodiazepine derivatives, given alone or in combination with amphetamine, were tested in mice subjected to five 100-trial avoidance sessions in the shuttle-box. All derivatives, execpt bromazepam, showed some facilitating effects on avoidance responding when given alone. Facilitation was particularly evident following the administration of chlordiazepoxide (2.5 mg/kg), medazepam (10 mg/kg) and nitrazepam (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg). Favourable effects were obtained by combining each benzodiazepine compound with amphetamine. The levels of avoidance respinses were usually higher under benzodiazepine-amphetamine combinations than under benzodiazepines alone.\n",
      "[Age related effects of furosemide in the rat]. Furosemide (6 mg/kg i.p.) increases the renal excretion of water, osmotic active substances, sodium and chloride in 5 to 33 day old rats more than in adults. The dose-response-relations are the same in rats of all age groups: 6 mg/kg of furosemide i.p. are very effective, an increase in dose to 30-60 mg/kg i.p. is not followed by a significantly higher efficacy. The increase in the renal excretion of potassium, hydrogen ions, ammonium and hydrogen carbonate by furosemide is also small in young rats.\n",
      "The effect of sulfhydryl reagents on the heart rate and coronary flow of the isolated perfused guinea-pig heart. The action of a number of compounds able to react with thiols was tested on guinea-pig hearts perfused at constant pressure. The SH reagents used were NaNO2, oxidized glutathione, cystamine, diamide, 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, nitroglycerol, sodium nitroferricyanide and HgCl2. 6,6'-Dithiodinicotinic acid, an SH reagent that does not penetrate the cell, produced no effect. All the other SH reagents produced an increase in coronary flow. All except oxidized glutathione and nitroglycerol increased the heart rate. The increase in heart rate and oxygen consumption could be completely blocked by dichloroisoproterenol; the increase in coronary flow was not affected. Difluorodinitrobenzene, diamide, cystamine and NaNO2 significantly decreased the acid-soluble thiol content of the heart. For these compounds, there was a significant correlation between the decrease in coronary flow and the decrease in thiols. We conclude that in the isolated heart, most SH reagents, if used at the appropriate concentration, will increase the heart rate, probably by relaasing catecholamines. They will also decrease the coronary resistance, probably by a direct effect on the coronary vessels.\n",
      "Metabolic inhibition and adrenoceptor interconversion. The adrenergic receptor responses of isolated strips of iris dilator muscle from rabbits were studied. An alpha agonist, norepinephrine and a beta agonist, isoprenaline, were used to assess adrenergic sensitivity before and after pretreatment of tissues with metabolic inhibitors at 22, 29 and 37 degrees C. The metabolic inhibitors used were iodoacetic acid and dinitrophenol. Temperature change altered adrenoceptor sensitivity in the same manner before and after metabolic inhibition. Iodoacetic acid (10.4 mug/ml) pretreatment increased both alpha and beta responses. Dinitrophenol (1.8 mug/ml) pretreatment increased alpha and decreased beta responsiveness. The results obtained indicate that some metabolic process altered by dinitrophenol may be involved in this adrenoceptor interconversion seen when temperature is changed. This supports the theory that local environment determines the drug sensitivity (alpha or beta) of a single adrenergic receptor.\n",
      "The influence of temperature increase, elevation of extracellular h+-concentration, and of triiodothyronine on the actions of phenylephrine, histamine, and beta-sympathomimetic drugs on rabbit aortic strips. In the isolated preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta, the affinities of the vasoconstrictor agents phenylephrine and histamine, as well as of the vasodilator beta-sympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline, fenoterol (TH 1165a), terbutaline, and salbutamol under the conditions of temperature increase, triiodothyronine and decrease of extracellular pH were investigated. It was observed that (1) a temperature increase from 25 degrees to 42 degrees C significantly indreased the maximal tension evoked by histamine, whereas that induced by the alpha-sympathomimetic drug phenylephrine was not altered significantly; the maximal relaxation caused by beta-sympathomimetic drugs either at 25 degrees or at 42 degrees C did not differ from one another; (2) the affinities of histamine, phenylephrine and of the beta-sympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline, fenoterol, terbutaline, and salbutamol each were comparable at either 25 degrees or 42 degrees C; the rank order of efficacy of the beta-sympathomimetic drugs is isoprenaline greater than fenoterol greater than salbutamol greater than terbutaline; (3) a decrease of the pH from 7.37 to 7.15 diminished the affinities of histamine and of the beta sympathomimetic drugs whereas that of the alpha-adrenergic drug phenylephrine was not altered. A further decrease of the pH to 6.8 diminished additionally the affinity of histamine and of isoprenaline, and especially that of the other beta-sympathomimetic drugs to such an extent that in the latter case complete dose-response curves could not be determined any more; (4) pretreatment of the animals with 0.4 mg/kg of triiodothyronine (T3) for two days, which strongly depressed the tension induced by either histamine or phenylephrine, did not alter the affinity of both drugs; T3 in vitro (10(-6) M) only diminished the affinity of histamine but left that of phenylephrine unaltered; pretreatment for two days with 0.2 mg/kg of T3 yielded a significant diminution of the pD2-values for two beta-sympathomimetic drugs investigated, namely isoprenaline and fenoterol; also the administration of T3 in vitro in a final concentration of 10(-6) M resulted in a diminution of the affinity of both beta-sympathomimetic drugs; (5) the results obtained show that also on the aorta beta-adrenoceptor stimulants are dependent on the metabolic state while alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants are not.\n",
      "Influence of pH on the contractor effect of convulsant barbiturate on frog lung. Pentobarbial, thiopental and the convulsant 5-ethyl-5-(2-cyclohexylideneëthyl) barbituric acid (CHEB) were tested for contractor effect on the isolated lung of the fullfrog at pH 7.0 (7% CO2 and 20 mM HCO3-) and pH 8.4 (0.3% CO2 and 20mM HCO3-). CHEB was a potent contractor, thiopental a feeble contractor, and pentobarbital lacked contractor effect. The contractor potencies of both CHEB and thiopental were greater at the more acid pH. The potencies of formally charged agonists such as acetylcholine and K+ were not altered by the pH differences employed in these experiments. The pKa of CHEB was found to be 8.18 at 15 degrees C and 8.03 at 27 degrees C. Calculation of concentration-effect relationships of ionized and nonionized CHEB showed that only the nonionized CHEB was responsible for the contractor effect.\n",
      "Action of six commonly used benzodiazepines on isolated guinea-pig ileum preparation. The spasmolytic activity of six commonly used benzodiazepines was investigated on isolated guinea-pig ileum preparation. All six substances proved to be non-competitive antagonists of carbachol and barium chloride, the pD'2 values ranging between 3.23 and 4.37 in the presence of either agonist. The significance of these findings is discussed.\n",
      "Electrical events associated with the action of nicotine at the adrenergic nerve terminal. Nicotine perfused through the coronary circulation of the isolated atropinized cat heart elicits antidromic activity in the cardiac sympathetic nerves. The pattern of discharge varies in a complex fashion with dose. At low concentrations, activity may last up to 10 min, whereas at high doses the antidromic response may last only a few seconds. Sympathetic transmitter is released into the perfusion fluid. There is dissociation between the amount of transmitter that overflows from the heart and the total antidromic activity with increasing dose of nicotine. With smaller doses of nicotine, the magnitude of the antidromic activity probably indicates the level of depolarization of the nerve terminal. Injection of greater doses of nicotine causes still greater transmitter release but not the generation of antidromic impulses, due presumably to persistent depolarization below a critical level. During the nicotine infusion and immediately afterwards, the antidromic response to acetylcholine and the effector responses associated with the adrenergic transmitter release by acetylcholine and sympathetic nerve stimulation were blocked. The rates of recovery of these responses were similar with a half-time of 4 to 5 min. Although the antidromic response to KCl was blocked during the nicotine infusion, it recovered more rapidly. Within 1-1.5 min, the antidromic response to KCl tended to exceed control levels. It is proposed that nicotine causes a prolonged depolarization of the membrane of the adrenergic nerve terminal. The site of action of nicotine, the basis of its prolonged action, and the interrelationship of this depolarization with transmitter release and intracellular uptake are discussed.\n",
      "Positive inotropic effect of insulin on rabbit auricle in vitro. Water soluble pig insulin (4 x 10(-8) to 4 x 10(-7) g/ml) produced a marked and long-lasting increase in the contractile force of the rabbit auricle in vitro. Once the maximum effect for a given insulin concentration had been reached, addition of more insulin did not produce any further increase in inotropic effect. Insulin was without effect in reserpinized animals. Inhibition of cardiac beta-receptors by propranolol suppressed the positive inotropic effect of insulin. These findings support the hypothesis that insulin releases catecholamines from the myocardium.\n",
      "Ionic basis for intracellular 14C-nicotine accumulation in slices from different rat brain areas. The effects of ionic alterations on the accumulation, distribution and movements of 14C-nicotine in slices from rat brain striatum, hypothalamus, cortex and cerebellum were studied. The uptake of 14C-nicotone is not dependent upon Na+ present in the incubation fluid because a K+-substituted (O-Na+) solution increased the 14C-nicotine tissue space, a tris-substituted (O-Na+) solution decreased the 14C-nicotine tissue space and a sucrose-substituted (O-Na+) solution did not change the amount of 14C-nicotine taken up when compared to the 14C-nicotine tissue space obtained in a normal incubation solution. However, all three Na+-free solutions elicited a sustained decrease in 14C-nicotine efflux. The increase in 14C-nicotine space produced in a K+-substituted (O-Na+) solution was present primarily in the slower component of a two-component washout, whereas the decrease produced in a tris-substituted (O-Na+) solution produced an equal percentage decrease in the size of both components. Most of the observed effects could be attributed to a linear relationship between the logarithm of the intracellular K+ concentration and the 14C-nicotine tissue space. In conclusion, it appears that there is an intracellular binding site for nicotine and that the degree of binding is dependent upon the concentration of K+.\n",
      "Mechanism of the antidiuretic effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation in man. Beta-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol hydrochloride in animals causes an antidiuresis similar to antidiuretic hormone. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether isoproterenol inhibits water diuresis in man. Seven young male volunteers were studied during water diuresis in three phases: (1) water-loading, (2) water-loading plus isoproterenol, and (3) water-loading plus isoproterenol plus propranolol hydrochloride. Antidiuresis occurred 20 minutes following isoproterenol infusion (0.03mug to 0.06mug/kg/min) from a mean of 19.4 to 2.0 ml/min. We found that antidiuresis is due to the hormonal (antidiuretic hormone) and nonhormonal changes (decreased glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow). These in turn are due to the cardiovascular effects of the drug.\n",
      "Renal acidification in sickle cell trait. Nine sickle cell trait and nine control subjects underwent six-hour ammonium chloride acid loading. Maximal urine osmolality and renal hemodynamics were studied separately. Base line arterial pH, carbon dioxide pressure (Pco2), and [HCO3] were normal and comparable in the two groups. After ammonium chloride loading, urine pH decreased to 5.3 or less in all, and maximal excretion of ammonium and titratable and net acid was comparable as was urine minus blood Pco2 after bicarbonate loading. The ammonium chloride acidosis caused a small decrease in red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels but no alteration in oxygen pressure at 50% saturation at pH 7.4, sickling, or adverse effects. Control and sickle cell trait subjects had comparable renal hemodynamics but maximal urine osmolality was lower in sickle-cell trait subjects. Adults with sickle cell trait have diminished renal concentrating ability and normal renal acidification and hemodynamics.\n",
      "Therapeutic implications of gentamicin accumulation in severly diseased kidneys. We evaluated the influence of severe disease in human kidneys (12 patients) on gentamicin sulfate accumulation characteristics in such tissue and compared the results with intrarenal tissue concentration data derived from the study of healthy dogs (54 kidneys) during variation in hydration and urinary pH. Our results indicate that, in the management of pyelonephritis complicating preexisting renal disease, if the minimal inhibitory gentamicin concentration for an infecting organism is greater than the usual therapeutic an nontoxic serum levels of the compound, then it may be appropriate to use alternate antibiotics that demonstrate lesser reduction in tissue drug accumulation in diseased kidneys.\n",
      "The influence of pH on the growth and stability of transmissible gastroenteritis virus in vitro. The influence of pH on the growth of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in adult pig thyroid cell culture, and on the stability of the virus was studied. At pH 7.2 and 100 fold higher than those at pH 8.0. The adsorption, penetration and uncoating steps of the viral replicative cycle were shown to be unaffected by pH variation. Synthesis of TGEV RNA during the first 12 hours post infection was found to be unaffected by pH variation between the range 6.5-8.0. After 12 hours breakdown of this RNA appeared to occur in cultures held at pH 7.2 and 8.0 but not at pH 6.5. When incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours the virus infectivity was found to be least affected by pH 6.5 but when kept at 4 degrees C for the same length of time, the virus infectivity remained constant between pH 5.0 and pH 8.0.\n",
      "The influence of physicochemical factors on the thermal inactivation of murine interferon. The degradation of biological activity of virus-induced murine interferon was determined in linear nonisothermal and multiple isothermal tests. The stabilizing effect of pH during heating on interferon in solution was greatest at low pH, such that pH 2 greater than pH 5 greater than pH 7 greater than or equal to pH 9; freeze-dried preparations of interferon were also more heat-stable at acid pH than at neutral pH. Heat stability was a function of the H+-ion concentration rather than the ionic composition of the buffer; interferon solutions containing monovalent cations with different ionic radii had similar heat stability. A change in the H+ ion concentration was a critical event during the cooling of heated interferon: a shift in the direction of acidity contributed to stability whereas a shift towards alkalinity led to inactivation. The rate of cooling of heated interferon significantly influenced its residual activity. Rapid cooling and sudden freezing decreased the residual activities of interferons at pH 2 and 9 more than \"normal\" cooling, an effect not observed at pH 7. Interferon heated to 80degree C could not be reactivated at 40degree C or 55degree C. Interferon of higher apparent molecular weight was more heat-stable than that with lower apparent molecular weight. It is postulated that the physicochemical alterations in the aqueous environment significantly affecting the stability of interferon operate by producing changes in the size and/or conformation of interferon molecules. A model is proposed that relates thermal inactivation to different possible molecular states of interferon.\n",
      "Isoelectric focusing of herpes simplex virus. Herpes simplex virus was inserted into a preformed stable pH gradient and electrofocused for about one hour. Dextran was used as the density gradient forming agent. Virions banded at pH 4.9+/-0.1 and nucleocapsids at 4.1+/-0.05. About 10-20 per cent of infective virus was recovered.\n",
      "Effect of pH on the growth and cytopathogenicity of avian infectious bronchitis virus in chick kidney cells. The growth of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chick kidney cells at different pH values in the range 6.0-9.0 demonstrated that although the virus was released at a much faster rate at the higher pH values the titre tended to drop more quickly. At the acid pH values the virus was released more slowly but reached a maximum titre similar to that at the higher pH values and showed only minimum reduction in infectivity up to 49 hours post inoculation. The stability of virus in tissue culture medium was shown to be directly related to pH 6.0-8.0, being more stable at the acid pH values. The degree of cytopathogenicity induced in chick kidney cells following infection with IBV was directly related to the pH at which the cells were incubated, occurring earlier and more extensively in cells at the higher pH values. Cell macromolecule synthesis in chick kidney cells was inhibited following infection with IBV and was apparently due to cell damage and death.\n",

      "Effect of prednisolone and salicyclic acid on ionic fluxes across the human stomach. We compared ionic fluxes across human gastric mucosa after instillation of test solutions of isotonic hydrochloric acid alone or containing salicylic acid, or prednisolone or both. Prednisolone produced no alteration in fluxes of H+ and Na+ ions compared with controls. Salicyclic acid induced a significant net loss of H+ ions and gain of Na+ ions indicating alteration of the gastric mucosal barrier. Combined salicyclic acid plus prednisolone produced no increase in permeability of gastric mucosa to H+ and Na+ ions or to salicylic acid itself. Prednisolone was not appreciably absorbed from the stomach while salicylic acid was well absorbed. Combination of salicylic acid and prednisolone did not increase absorption of either drug. Neither salicylic acid nor prednisolone solutions alone or combined caused an increase in pepsin output over that due to 160 mM HCl. Salicylic acid resulted in a significant fall in potential difference compared to control while prednisolone produced no change in the one subject studied. In acute studies in man prednisolone is not absorbed from the stomach, does not itself affect the gastric mucosal barrier nor pepsin output nor does it enhance the absorption of or effect of salicylic acid on gastric ionic fluxes or pepsin output.\n",
      "Effects of altering monoamine metabolism on the adrenocortical response to hypoxia. Anesthetized dogs, which had been prepared with lumboadrenal vein cannulae, were intravenously infused with monoamine axidase (alphaETA), tryptophan hydroxylase (pCPA) or tyrosine hydroxylase (alphaMT) inhibitors 30 min prior to exposure to 10% oxygen at ground level. These studies were designed to ascertain the role of the neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine, in the adrenocortical response to hypoxia. In normoxic animals, alphaETA decreased basal cortisol secretion and increased systolic pressure, whereas pCPA and alphaMT were essentially without afffect on these parameters. All inhibitors prevented the rise in cortisol secretion usually observed in hypoxic dogs. Alpha ETA appeared to inhibit the adrenocortical response to hypoxia as a result of its potent pressore activity, while pCPA and alphaMT inhibited cortisol secretion by interfering with the synthesis of serotonin and norepinephrine, respictively. These data suggest that substances which alter the content and/or turnover of brain monoamines abolish the hypoxic rise in cortisol secretion and thus would lower the resistance of the animal to this stressor.\n",
      "Calcitonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in rat renal tubular membranes. 1. Renal tubular membranes from rat kidneys were prepared, and adenylate cyclase activity was measured under basal conditions, after stimulation by NaF or salmon calcitonin. Apparent Km value of the enzyme for hormone-linked receptor was close to 1 x 10(-8) M. 2. The system was sensitive to temperature and pH. pH was found to act both on affinity for salmon calcitonin-linked receptor and maximum stimulation, suggesting an effect of pH on hormone-receptor binding and on a subsequent step. 3. KCl was without effect areas whereas CoCl and CaCl2 above 100 muM and MnCl2 above 1 muM inhibited F- -and salmon calcitonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase activities. The Ca2+ inhibition of the response reflected a fall in maximum stimulation and not a loss of affinity of salmon calcitonin-linked receptor for the enzyme. 4. The measurement of salmon calcitonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity as a function of ATP concentration showed that the hormone increases the maximum velocity of the adenylate cyclase. GTP, ITP and XTP at 200 muM did not modify basal, salmon calcitonin- and parathyroid hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase activities. 5. Basal, salmon calcitonin- and F- -sensitive adenylate cyclase activities decreased at Mg2+ concentrations below 10 mM. High concentrations of Mg2+ (100 mM) led to an inhibition of the F- -stimulated enzyme. 6. Salmon calcitonin-linked receptor had a greater affinity for adenylate cyclase than human or porcine calcitonin-linked receptors. There was no additive effect of these three calcitonin peptides whereas parathyroid hormone added to salmon calcitonin increased adenylate cyclase activity, thus showing that both hormones bound to different membrane receptors. Human calcitonin fragments had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. 7. Salmon calcitonin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity decreased with the preincubation time. This was due to progressive degradation of the hormone and not to the rate of binding to membrane receptors.\n",
      "Stabilization of rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase by tetracycline. Rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase was purified 200-fold and an antiserum raised against it in rabbits. 2. Hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase activity was increased fourfold by tyrosine, twofold by tetracycline, 2.5-fold by cortisone 21-acetate and ninefold by a combination of tyrosine and cortisol administered intraperitoneally to rats. 3. Radioimmunoassay with 14C-labelled tyrosine aminotransferase, in conjunction with rabbit antiserum against the enzyme, revealed that cortisol stimulates the synthesis of the enzyme de novo, but that tetracycline has no such effect. 4. Incubation of rat liver homogenates with purified tyrosine aminotransferase in vitro leads to a rapid inactivation of the enzyme, which tetracycline partially inhibits. 5. The inactivation is brought about by intact lysosomes, and the addition of 10mM-cysteine increases the rate of enzyme inactivation, which is further markedly increased by 10mM-Mg2+ and 10mM-ATP. Here again tetracycline partially inhibits the decay rate, leading to the inference that the increase of tyrosine aminotransferase activity in vivo by tetracycline is brought about by the latter inhibiting the lysosomal catheptic action.\n",
      "Factors regulating amino acid release from extrasplanchnic tissues in the rat. Interactions of alanine and glutamine. 1. Factors regulating the release of alanine and glutamine in vivo were investigated in starved rats by removing the liver from the circulation and monitoring blood metabolite changes for 30 min. 2. Alanine and glutamine were the predominant amino acids released into the circulation in this preparation. 3. Dichloroacetate, an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase, inhibited net alanine release: it also interfered with the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine. 4. L-Cycloserine, an inhibitor of alanine aminotransferase, decreased alanine accumulation by 80% after functional hepatectomy, whereas methionine sulphoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, decreased glutamine accumulation by the same amount. 5. It was concluded that: (a) the alanine aminotransferase and the glutamine synthetase pathways respectively were responsible for 80% of the alanine and glutamine released into the circulation by the extrasplanchnic tissues, and extrahepatic proteolysis could account for a maximum of 20%; (b) alanine formation by the peripheral tissues was dependent on availability of pyruvate and not of glutamate; (c) glutamate availability could influence glutamine formation subject, possibly, to renal control.\n",
      "Amino acids attached to transfer ribonucleic acid in vivo. 1. tRNA was extracted from rabbit liver by both the phenol and diethyl pyrocarbonate methods under conditions preventing deacylation of the amino acids attached in vivo. 2. After deacylation 12 amino acids were determined by gas-liquid chromatography, by using the flame-ionization and nitrogen-sensitive thermionic detectors. 3. Comparison of the distribution of 12 amino acids attached to tRNA with those contained in total tissue protein and in the free pool showed little correlation. 4. Results for the enzymic charging assay for tRNA in vitro did not correlate satisfactorily with the analysis of amino acids attached to tRNA in vivo. Marked differences were ntoed in comparison made between our own and other published results.\n",

      "A comparative study between a chondroitinase B and a chondroitinase AC from Flavobacterium heparinum: Isolation of a chondroitinase AC-susceptible dodecasaccharide from chondroitin sulphate B. A chondroitinase that degrades only chondroitin sulphate B was isolated from Flavobacterium heparinum, and separated from a constitutive chondroitinase AC also present in extracts of F. heparinum. The enzyme acts only on chondroitin sulphate B, producing oligo- and tetra-saccharides, plus an unsaturated 4-sulphated disaccharide (deltaDi-4S). The oligosaccharide fraction (mol. wt. 3000) is susceptible to chondroitinase AC, producing mainly deltaDi-4S. The chondroitinase B is distinguished from chondroitinase AC by several properties, such as the effect of certain metal ions, temperature for optimal activity, and susceptibility to increasing salt concentrations. The enzyme is induced in F. heparinum by all the chondroitin sulphates, as well as by the disaccharides prepared from the chondroitins. The mechanism of induction of the enzyme and the structure of chondroitin sulphate B are discussed in relation to these results.\n",
      "Subtilopeptidase A isoenzyme system. Interaction with serum components and its importance for quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. A method was developed which involved electroimmunoassay and crossed immunoelectrophoresis of subtilopeptidase A (EC 3.4.21.14). Initial trials with unfractionated antiserum were not successful and interaction of the enzyme with non-immunoglobulin serum components were shown to be the cause of the failures. Quantitative immunoelectrophoresis was possible when purified immunoglobulins were used. A pH of 6.5 (lower than the usual pH 8.6) was necessary to obtain a proper baseline definition. Subtilopeptidase A was confirmed as a multiple isoenzyme system. Qualitative inter-batch variations were detected. Di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate inhibition altered the electrophoretic pattern, but no loss of antigenic determinants was observed.\n",
      "Fructose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase from rabbit muscle. Effect of pH on the rate of formation and on the equilibrium concentration of the carbanion intermediate. The rate of oxidation of ferricyanide of the aldolase-dihydroxyacetone phosphate complex was measured under different conditions. The following conclusions are drawn. 1. In the cleavage of fructose diphosphate, catalysed by native aldolase, the steady-state concentration of the enzyme-dihydroxyacetone phosphate carbanion intermediate represents less than 6% of the total enzyme-substrate intermediates. 2. Fructose diphosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate compete for the four catalytic sites on aldolase, the binding of fructose diphosphate being about twice as tight. 3. The equilibrium concentration of the carbanion intermediate formed by reaction of carboxypeptidase-treated aldolase with dihydroxyacetone phosphate is independent of pH between 5.0 and 9.0. The rates of fromation of the carbanion intermediate and of the reverse reaction are, however, concomitantly increased by increasing pH between 5.0 and 6.5.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of a collagenase extracted from rabbit tumours. A collagenase was purified from homogenates of V2 ascites-cell carcinoma growing in rabbit muscle. (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography, and affinity chromatography (by using the CB7 CNBr) cleavage fragment of alpha 1(I) collagen linked to agarose) gave a 268000-fold purification and a sevenfold increase in total enzyme units recovered. The specific activity, defined as mumol of collagen in solution cleaved/h per mg of enzyme at 35 degrees C, WAS 1.74.2. The collagenase had a broad pH optimum from pH7.0 to 9.5, and a mol.wt. of between 33000 and 35000. It was inhibited by dithiothreitol, L-cysteine, D-penicillamine, EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, and by both rabbit and human serum. 3. Removal of cations by a chelating resin (Chelex 100) produced as inactive enzyme that could be reactiviated by the addition of Ca2+ ions at concentrations as low as 1muM. Other bivalent cations were not effective. 4. The purified collagenase cleaved peptides alpha2 and alpha1-CB7 (denatured polypeptides of collagen) at 37 degrees C at one site only. [alpha1 (I)]2alpha2 and [alpha1(III)]3 collagens in solution were cleaved at the same site approximately five times more rapidly than [alpha1 (II)]3. 5. An inhibitor of the enzyme in the tumour extracts, which was dissociable from the enzyme at the (NH4) 2SO4 precipitation step of purification, had a mol. wt. of between 40000 and 50000 but was distinct from the alpha1 trypsin inhibitor. 6. Studies with zonal density-gradient centrifugation suggested that the enzyme was bound to fibrillar substrate (collagen) extracellularly, but that it was not associated with enzymes originating in cell mitochondria, microsomal preparations or lysosomes.\n",
      "Inhibition of leucocytic lysosomal enzymes by glycosaminoglycans in vitro. 1. A lysosomal fraction was separated by density-gradient centrifugation from a highly purified human polymorphonuclear leucocyte suspension. 2. Some 23 different lysosomal enzymes were assayed for activity in the presence of various concentrations of glycosaminoglycans. 3. The 21 acid hydrolases assayed were strongly inhibited to different degrees by low (0-12 mmol/l) concentrations of glycosaminoglycans in a pH-dependent manner. Thus inhibitions were stronger below pH4.5, with activity returning to control values at about pH5.0. 4. On a molar basis, the inhibitory activity for the several glycosaminoglycans studied was: heparin greater than chondroitin sulphate greater than hyaluronic acid. 5. Once the glycosaminoglycan-acid hydrolase complex was formed, it was partially dissociated by slight elevations in the pH of the incubation medium, by increasing the ionic strength of the incubation medium, or by adding several cationic proteins (e.g. histone, protamine). 6. As leucocytic lysosomes contain large amounts of chondroitin sulphate, and have a strongly acid intragranular pH, we suggest that glycosaminoglycans may modify lysosomal function through the formation of complexes with lysosomal enzymes, by inhibiting the digestive activity of the acid hydrolases when the intralysosomal pH is below their pI.\n",
      "Circulating levels of prolactin in human breast cancer. Serum prolactin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassays in 98 patients with established carcinoma of breast, 12 patients with cystic mastitis and 10 patients with gynaecomastia and compared with that of age matched normal control women. The serum prolactin levels in the patients with breast cancer, gynaecomastia or cystic mastitis were observed to be similar to that in normal women. It was interesting to note that the levels of prolactin in the luteal phase of the cycle were higher than that in the early follicular phase in normal women.\n",
      "Effect of aflatoxin B1 on pyridine nucleotides and NADP linked dehydrogenases. The effect of a single interaperitoneal injection (6 mg/kg body weight) of aflatoxin B1 in propylene glycol on pyridine nucleotides and NDP linked dehydrogenases was studied 24 h after administration of the toxin. The liver showed a decrease in total proteins and pyridine nucleotides though levels of NADP and NADPH remained unchanged. Levels of NAD and NADH were decreased. The activities of hepatic of hwpRIX of hepatic malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) were not altered though ICDH showed an increase when expressed on protein basis. However, there was a significance decrease in the activity of combined HMP dehydrogenases. Adipose tissue showed increased activities of the HMP dehydrogenasess.\n",
      "Esterase activity of zinc neutral proteases. The hydrolysis of a series of depsipeptides demonstrates that the zinc neutral endopeptidases of bacteria are active esterases. Esters such as BzGly-OPhe-Ala, BzGly-OLeu-Ala, and FA-Gly-OLeu-NH2 are hydrolyzed at rates three- to eightfold slower than are their exact peptide analogues, when hydrolyzed by thermolysin, Bacillus subtilis neutral protease and the neutral protease from Aeromonas proteolytica. Ester hydrolysis by zinc neutral proteases follows the characteristic preference for hydrophobic amino acids adjacent to the site of cleavage, discerned from the hydrolysis of peptide substrates. Removal of zinc from thermolysin abolishes the esterase activity of the native enzyme. Among the metals examined, only Co2+ and Zn2+ restore esterase activity to any significant extent, Co2+ restoring 50% and Zn2+ 100% of the native thermolysin activity. The hydrolysis of esters and peptides by thermolysin does not differ with respect to either the binding or catalytic steps. Substrate specificity, pH-rate profiles, inhibitor, and deuterium isotope effects are identical for both types of substrates.\n",
      "The binding of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to citrate synthase of Escherichia coli K12. Citrate synthase from Escherichia coli enhances the fluorescence of its allosteric inhibitor, NADH, and shifts the peak of emission of the coenzyme from 457 to 428 nm. These effects have been used to measure the binding of NADH to this enzyme under various conditions. The dissociation constant for the NADH-citrate synthase complex is about 0.28 muM at pH 6.2, but increases toward alkaline pH as if binding depends on protonation of a group with a pKa of about 7.05. Over the pH range 6.2-8.7, the number of binding sites decreases from about 0.65 to about 0.25 per citrate synthase subunit. The midpoint of this transition is at about pH 7.7, and it may be one reflection of the partial depolymerization of the enzyme which is known to occur in this pH range. A gel filtration method has been used to verify that the fluorescence enhancement technique accurately reveals all of the NADH molecules bound to the enzyme in the concentration range of interest. NAD+ and NADP+ were weak competitive inhibitors of NADH binding at pH 7.8 (Ki values greater than 1 mM), but stronger inhibition was shown by 5'-AMP and 3'-AMP, with Ki values of 83 +/- 5 and 65 +/- 4 muM, respectively. Acetyl-CoA, one of the substrates, and KCl, an activator, also inhibit the binding in a weakly cooperative manner. All of these effects are consistent with kinetic observations on this system. We interpret our results in terms of two types of binding site for nucleotides on citrate synthase: an active site which binds acetyl-CoA, the substrate, or its analogue 3'-AMP; and an allosteric site which binds NADH or its analogue 5'-AMP and has a lesser affinity for other nicotinamide adenine dinucloetides. When the active site is occupied, we propose that NADH cannot bind to the allosteric site, but 5'-AMP can; conversely, when NADH is the in the allosteric site, the active site cannot be occupied. In addition to these two classes of sites, there must be points for interaction with KCl and other salts. Oxaloacetate, the second substrate, and alpha-ketoglutarate, an inhibitor whose mode of action is believed to be allosteric, have no effect on NADH binding to citrate synthase at pH 7.8. When NADH is bound to citrate synthase, it quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the enzyme. The amount of quenching is proportional to the amount of NADH bound, at least up to a binding ratio of 0.50 NADH per enzyme subunit. This amount of binding leads to the quenching of 53 +/- 5% of the enzyme fluorescence, which means that one NADH molecule can quench all the intrinsic fluorescence of the subunit to which it binds.\n",
      "The structure of the covalent adduct formed by the interaction of 3-dimethylamino-1-propyne and the flavine of mitochondrial amine oxidase. 3-Dimethylamino-1-propyne irreversibly inactivates mitochondrial monoamine oxidase from bovine liver. The inactivation results in the loss of absorption in the 450-500-nm region of the flavine spectrum and a concomitant increase in absorbance at 410 nm. For the enzyme-bound adduct epsilon410 = 28000. The spectral properties of the adduct of the liver enzyme with 3-dimethylamino-1-propyne are similar to those observed when the pig kidney enzyme is inactivated with pargyline (Chuang et al. (1974), J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2381). From a proteolytic digest of the enzyme inactivated with labeled inhibitor a flavine peptide has been isolated which contains 1 mol of inactivator/mol of flavine. The chemical and spectral properties of the adduct are those of compounds containing the structure --N--CH==CH--CH==N+ less than. It was concluded that the flavine-inhibtor adduct is a N-5 substituted dihydroflavine and its structure has been determined.\n",
      "The absolute configuration of the amino acids in delta-(alpha-aminoadipyl)cysteinylvaline from Penicillium chrysogenum. Radioactive carbon-14 L-alpha-aminoadipic acid, L-cysteine, or L-valine were readily incorporated into the intracellular tripeptide, delta-(alpha-aminoadipyl)cysteinylvaline (ACV), by washed starved cells of Penicillium chrysogenum. The labeled ACV in each case was oxidized with performic acid and isolated as its corresponding sulfonic acid derivative. After acid hydrolysis, the configuration of the component acids was determined by L- and D-amino acid oxidases, which showed the tripeptide (ACV) from P. chrysogenum to be delta-(L-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine.\n",
      "Chromatin-bound protease: degradation of chromosomal proteins under chromatin dissociation conditions. A chromatin-bound protease, active in 2 M NaCl-5 M urea or 5 M urea alone, was demonstrated in rat liver, kidney, testes, brain, rabbit bone marrow, chicken reticulocyte, and Ehrlich ascites chromatin. Chicken erythrocyte chromatin did not possess any detectable proteolytic activity in salt and urea. The proteolytic activity of rat liver chromatin in salt and urea was found to be independent of the methods of chromatin preparation. The protease can be inhibited by the serine specific reagents phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate and the alkylating reagent, carbobenzoxyphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, in the presence of organic solvents at 1 mM concentration. The inhibitions of chromatin-bound protease in rat liver by these compounds are irreversible. On the other hand, carbobenzoxyphenylalanine and p-nitrophenyl acetate were shown to be reversible inhibitors of rat liver chromatin-bound protease. The application of these inhibitors during the dissociation of chromatin by salt and urea may be useful to researchers interested in purifying various chromosomal proteins or to those researchers doing reconstitution studies with labile chromatins.\n",
      "ATPase of Escherichia coli: purification, dissociation, and reconstitution of the active complex from the isolated subunits. A simple procedure for the purification of Mg2+-stimulated ATPase of Escherichia coli by fractionation with poly(ethylene glycols) and gel filtration is described. The enzyme restores ATPase-linked reactions to membrane preparations lacking these activities. Five different polypeptides (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon) are observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. Freezing in salt solutions splits the enzyme complex into subunits which do not possess any catalytic activity. The presence of different subunits is confirmed by electrophoretic and immunological methods. The active enzyme complex can be reconstituted by decreasing the ionic strength in the dissociated sample. Temperature, pH, protein concentration, and the presence of substrate are each important determinants of the rate and extent of reconstitution. The dissociated enzyme has been separated by ion-exchange chromatography into two major fragments. Fragment IA has a molecular weight of about 100000 and contains the alpha, gamma, and epsilon polypeptides. The minor fragment, IB, has about the same molecular weight but contains, besides alpha, gamma, and epsilon, the delta polypeptide. Fragment II, with a molecular weight of about 52000, appears to be identical with the beta polypeptide. ATPase activity can be reconstituted from fragments IA and II, whereas the capacity of the ATPase to drive energy-dependent processes in depleted membrane vesicles is only restored after incubation of these two fractions with fraction IB, which contains the delta subunit.\n",
      "Conformation of gonadotropin releasing hormone. The conformation of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (Gn-RH), whose primary sequence is pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-GlyNH2, and of several of its structural analogues has been studied by circular dichroism, optical rotatory dispersion, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The effects of pH, guanidine, and temperature on fluorescence emission have also been examined. Titration data demonstrate that the histidine and tyrosine residues are free of any mutual interactions. The similarity of emission spectra in water and in guanidine hydrochloride solutions precludes significant interactions between the fluorescent groups and other residues. Neither the temperature nor the pH profiles of the emission intensities of either tyrosine or tryptophan reveal any fixed secondary structure in Gn-RH. Both the extent of alkaline quenching and the distance of 10-11 A calculated from Förster energy transfer theory are in accord with a randomly coiled structure with only one residue between tyrosine and tryptophan. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectrum and optical rotatory dispersion do not exhibit any contributions from peptide bonds in an ordered structure, although there is a perturbation of the peptide absorption region due to overlapping bands from side-chain chromophores. Gn-RH, therefore, appears to behave as a random coil polypeptide in water devoid of any intrachain residue interactions. This nonordered structure in Gn-RH and the lack of any significant differences in the physical-chemical properties of the hormone analogues indicate that a predetermined solution conformation is not required for biological activity. In contrast to its behavior in water, Gn-RH in trifluoroethanol exhibits a conformational transition, with the formation of a beta structure. Differences in conformational changes exhibited by several analogues in trifluoroethanol may be relevant to their relative biological activities at the receptor site.\n",
      "Low and high pH form of cadmium carbonic anhydrase determined by nuclear quadrupole interaction. The pH dependence of the nuclear quadrupole interaction between the excited 247-keV state in 111Cd bound to the active site in human carbonic anhydrase B and the nearest protein surroundings has been studied by means of the nuclear spectroscopic technique of perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays. The enzyme has been studied in the pH region 5.6-11.0 at 22 and -196 degrees C. The results show that the Cd enzyme changes from one form at low pH to another form at high pH both at 22 and -196 degrees C. The pK of the transition is 8.9 +/- 0.2 at -196 degrees C and close to 9 at 22 degrees C. Parallel to this transformation, the esterase activity of the Cd enzyme for the hydration of p-nitrophenyl acetate exhibits a pH dependency with a pH of 9.1 +/- 0.2. The sulfonamide inhibitor acetazolamide completely inhibits this activity of the Cd enzyme. The quadrupole interaction parameters for the Cd enzyme are not significantly different at -196 degrees C from those obtained at 22 degrees C. A measurement at 0 degrees C pH 5.7 shows, however, a form different from those at 22 degrees C pH 5.6 and -196 degrees C pH 5.7. The change in the quadrupole interaction with pH is, in a simple model, consistent with an ionization of a metal-bound water molecule.\n",
      "Oxidation-reduction properties of Chromatium vinosum high potential iron-sulfur protein. The oxidation-reduction properties of the high potential iron-sulfur protein (HIPIP) from Chromatium vinosum have been investigated. Both equilibrium and kinetic measurements demonstrate electron transport by HIPIP is pH independent in the pH range 7-11. The kinetics of reduction (potassium ferrocyanide, SO2, S2O42-, sodium ascorbate, and Rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome c2) and oxidation (potassium ferricyanide and Rhodospirillium rubrum cytochrome c2) of HIPIP are reported. Based on the data obtained with different reactants and the influence of ionic strength, pH, and temperature on the kinetics of oxidation and reduction, a number of conclusions can be drawn. (1) HIPIP undergoes rapid outer-sphere electron transfer with no evidence of kinetic complexity and no indication of complex formation with various reactants. (2) The site of oxidation of reduced HIPIP has an apparent negative charge while the site of reduction of oxidized HIPIP is uncharged. (3) HIPIP appears to interact with a physiological reactant (R. rubrum cytochrome c2) at the same site as nonphysiological oxidants or reductants suggesting single minimum energy pathways for the oxidation and reduction processes. (4) Based on a comparison of the rates of oxidation and reduction with different reactants, it appears that steric restrictions and differences in oxidation-reduction potential are less important than electrostatic attraction and/or repulsion in determining the absolute rate constants. (5) The thermodynamic activation parameters indicate that both oxidation and reduction by the iron hexacyanides are driven entropically with the enthalpic terms making no contribution to HIPIP oxidation and a small contribution to HIPIP reduction. Based on the data reported here and available structural and physical-chemical information, possible mechanisms of the oxidation and reduction of HIPIP are discussed and their relative merits analyzed. The more likely mechanisms include electron transfer via a tyrosine residue, electron transfer through a nonaqueous media to the iron-sulfur chromophore, and direct interaction between the iron-sulfur chromophore and the different oxidants and reductants.\n",
      "Isolation, chemical, and physical properties of alpha-1-antitrypsin. A method of isolation of alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha-1-AT) in good yield from normal human plasma is described. A key step was affinity chromatography employing an antiserum which had been depleted of alpha-1-AT antibodies. The final preparations were homogeneous by immunological and physicochemical criteria. The specific activity of the purified alpha-1-AT was 0.363 mg of active bovine trypsin inhibited per 1.0 mg of inhibitor. Polyacrylamide gel patterns at both alkaline and acid pH of highly pure preparations frequently, but not invariably, showed multiple hands. Molecular weight studies by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation in aqueous buffer and in 6 M guanidine as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggest that alpha-1-AT is a single polypeptide chain having a molecular weight of 49,500. Other physical and chemical properties of the inhibitor are described. A limited N-terminal sequence (Glu-Asp-Pro-Gln-Gly-Asx-Ala-Ala) was obtained. It was found that alpha-1-AT easily forms polymers and higher aggregates when exposed to denaturing agents such as 8 M urea and 6 M guanidine. The results suggest that aggregation is determined by both covalent and noncovalent forces.\n",
      "Purification and properties of the thermostable acid protease of Penicillium duponti. An acid protease produced by the thermophilic fungus Penicillium duponti K 1014 has been purified by consecutive ion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography, and crystallized from aqueous acetone solution. The purified endopeptidase gave a symmetrical schlieren peak by sedimentation velocity, and was found to be homogeneous upon disc gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5. The enzyme was most active at pH 2.5 against milk casein and showed high thermostability. An isoelectric point of 3.81 was found by isoelectric focusing. A minimum molecular weight of 41 590 was calculated from the amino acid composition, adopting an arginine content of one residue per mole of enzyme. This minimum molecular weight is in good agreement with the value of 41 000 previously found by gel permeation (Hashimoto, H., Iwaasa, T., and Yokotsuka, T. (1973), Appl. Microbiol. 25, 578). Besides the thermostability, the purified P. duponti protease differs from other well-characterized acid proteases in that it contains carbohydrate, 4.33% expressed as glucose. The enzyme was not affected by p-bromophenacyl bromide, but was completely inactivated by alpha-diazo-p-bromoacetophenone, diazoacetyl-DL-norleucine methyl ester, and diazoacetylglycine ethyl ester, in the presence of Cu2+. The complete inactivation of the protease by diazoacetyl-DL-norleucine methyl ester resulted in the specific incorporation of 1 mol of norleucine/mol of enzyme. On the basis of similar behavior of other acid proteases toward this inactivator, the results suggest the presence at the active site of an unusually reactive carboxyl group, involved in the catalytic function. The naturally occurring pepsin inhibitor of Streptomyces naniwaensis [Murao, S., and Satoi, S. (1970), Agric. Biol. Chem. 34, 1265] inhibited also the protease, at a threefold molar excess with respect to the enzyme.\n",
      "Biosynthesis of bacterial glycogen. Purification and properties of the Escherichia coli B ADPglucose:1,4-alpha-D-glucan 4-alpha-glucosyltransferase. The Escherichia coli B glycogen synthase has been purified to apparent homogeneity with the use of a 4-aminobutyl-Sepharose column. Two fractions of the enzyme were obtained: glycogen synthase I with a specific activity of 380 mumol mg-1 and devoid of branching enzyme activity and glycogen synthase II having a specific activity of 505 mumol mg-1 and containing branching enzyme activity which was 0.1% of the activity observed for the glycogen synthase. Only one protein band was found in disc gel electrophoresis for each glycogen synthase fraction and they were coincident with glycogen synthase activity. One major protein band and one very faint protein band which hardly moved into the gel were observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the glycogen synthase fractions. The subunit molecular weight of the major protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of both glycogen synthase fractions was determined to be 49 000 +/- 2 000. The molecular weights of the native enzymes were determined by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Glycogen synthase I had a molecular weight of 93 000 while glycogen synthase II had a molecular weight of 200 000. On standing at 4 degrees C or at -85 degrees C both enzymes transform into species having molecular weights of 98 000, 135 000, and 185 000. Thus active forms of the E. coli B glycogen synthase can exist as dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the subunit. The enzyme was shown to catalyze transfer of glucose from ADPglucose to maltose and to higher oligosaccharides of the maltodextrin series but not to glucose. 1,5-Gluconolactone was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the glycogen synthase reaction. The glycogen synthase reaction was shown to be reversible. Formation of labeled ADPglucose occurred from either [14C]ADP or [14C]glycogen. The ratio of ADP to ADPglucose at equilibrium at 37 degrees C was determined and was found to vary threefold in the pH range of 5.27-6.82. From these data the ratio of ADP2- to ADPglucose at equilibrium was determined to be 45.8 +/- 4.5. Assuming that deltaF degrees of the hydrolysis of the alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage is -4.0 kcal the deltaF degrees of hydrolysis of the glucosidic linkage in ADPglucose is -6.3 kcal.\n",
      "Bovine procarboxypeptidase A: kinetics of peptide and ester hydrolysis. Bovine procarboxypeptidase A exhibits intrinsic hydrolytic activity toward haloacyl amino acids (Behnke and Vallee, 1972), as well as toward conventional peptide and ester substrates for carboxypeptidase A (Bezzone, 1974; Uren and Neurath, 1974). The kinetics of hydrolysis of a series of such substrates by native procarboxypeptidase has now been examined in detail in order to ascertain the extent to which the binding and catalytic sites of carboxypeptidase preexist inthe zymogen. Distinct differences in the substrate binding sites of the zymogen compared with the enzyme are apparent from their respective kinetic profiles as well as from the effects of modifiers on their activities. Substrate activation with the dipeptides BzGly-L-Phe and CbzGly-L-Phe, well known for carboxypeptidase, is exhibited also by the zymogen, but the corresponding substrate inhibition by CbzGly-L-Phe and BzGly-Ophe is absent. Moreover, the substrate inhibition of carboxypeptidase by CbzGlyGly-L-Phe and BzGly-Ophe is replaced by substrate activation in the zymogen...\n",
      "Ionic influences on the phase transition of dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine. The ionization and phase behavior of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine have been investigated under a variety of condtions by several different methods. As measured by turbidity changes, the temperature of the crystal-liquid crystal phase transition of this lipid is influenced by pH  and mono- and divalent cation concentrations. The pH-transition temperature curve is congruent with the curve relating temperature to the degree of ionization of the carboxyl group of the crystalline form. The transition temperature falls from an upper plateau of 72 degrees C at low pH values, where the carboxyl group is fully protonated, to a lower plateau of 55 degrees C at high pH values, where this group is fully ionized. The apparent pK (pH at 50% ionization) of the crystalline form shifts from 6.0 to 4.6 to 3.7 with an increase of NaCl concentration from 10(-3) to 0.1 to l.0 M, respectively. These observations are in accord with a simple theoretical analysis that utilizes diffuse double layer theory and the influence of surface potential on surface concentration of protons. In qualitative terms, an increase in electrolyte concentration reduces the surface potential, the result of which is a diminution of the surface-bulk pH difference and a lowering of the apparent pK. Assuming an area of 50 A2/molecule, the intrinsic pKa (apparent pK corrected for surface pH) of the carboxyl group is 2.7. A 1000-fold change of NaCl concentration produces a very large change in surface potential without influencing the transition temperature of the ionized form of the lipid.\n",
      "Light scattering from suspensions of membrane fragments derived from sonication of beef heart mitochondria. The intensity of light scattering from suspensions of membrane fragments prepared by sonication of beef heart mitochondria in the presence of EDTA at alkaline pH (ESMP) was determined at 45, 90, and 135 degrees with light of wavelength 546 nm. The dissymmetry ratio Z = I45 degrees c/I135 degrees c, where I45 degrees c and I135 degrees c are the scattering intensities at 45 and 135 degrees extrapolated to zero particle concentration and corrected for reflectance effects, was used to calculate particle size from the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye theory. An average particle diameter D of 184-190 nm was obtained, within the range of particle diameter 50-300 nm determined previously by electron microscopy. This average diameter determined by light scattering is a useful parameter for characterization of ESMP particle size. We propose the term: light scattering average particle diameter, DLS, for this parameter. The refractive index of ESMP was determined to be 1.443 by measurement of scattering intensity in buffer solutions of varying sucrose concentration. The value of Z was independent of sucrose concentration in this determination, showing that the particles are osmotically inactive toward sucrose. The values of average particle diameter DLS and of refractive index fall within the range of validity of the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye theory, for which light scattering changes are attributable solely to dimension change, rather than to change in particle refractive index. Uptake of water accompanying energy-linked salt uptake in ESMP was calculated from light scattering changes to be 0.18 mul of H2O/mg of protein, compared with 0.49 mul of H2O/mg of protein measured by dextran inaccessibility. Measurement of light scattering changes provides a rapid and sensitive method for determining volume changes of ESMP. The magnitude of the volume change observed during energy-linked water and salt uptake and the initial degree of hydration suggests that ESMP are analogous to polyelectrolyte gels with regard to sorption of strong electrolytes and that the Donnan formulation for ion exchange equilibria may be usefully applied to these processes in ESMP.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of two alkaline ribonucleases from calf serum. Treatment of calf serum at 60 degrees C and pH 3.5 followed by chromatography on carboxymethyl (CM) cellulose resulted in the separation of two major peaks of alkaline RNAse activity. One was eluted from CM-cellulose at 0.075 M KCl with an overall purification of 5400-fold and the other was eluted at 0.25 M KCl with a 6700-fold purification. The RNAse eluted from CM-cellulose at 0.075 M KCl was almost completely inhibited by anti-RNAse A serum and by the endogenous RNAse inhibitor and a 33% inhibition was observed in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2. This enzyme seems to be similar or identical to RNAse A. The other RNAse, eluted from CM-cellulose at 0.25 M KCl was not inhibited by anti-RNAse A or 5 mM MgCl2 and was much less sensitive to the endogenous inhibitor. Both enzymes degraded RNA endonucleolytically and the nucleoside monophosphates obtained after partial hydrolysis of RNA by the two serum RNAases were primarily 2'- or 3' -CMP and 2'- or 3' -UMP. Poly(A), native DNA and denatured DNA were degraded slowly or not at all. The RNAase A-like enzyme degraded poly(C) at a significantly faster rate, and poly(U) at a slower rate, than RNA. However, the other serum RNAase was more active with poly(U) than with RNA and almost inactive with poly(C) as the substrate.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of the brush border fraction from newborn rat renal proximal tubule cells. A renal brush border fraction was isolated from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats, and its morphological and enzymatic characteristics were studied in comparison to that from the adult. Definite microvillar structures are seen by electron microscopy, and border preparations from the newborn are enriched in known marker enzymes. Though morphological development is more advanced and enzyme specific activities are greater in the adult, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of membrane proteins reveals no significant change in pattern with increasing age. These studies suggest that the brush border of the proximal tubule cell is present at birth as a significantly developed structure.\n",
      "Glial fibrillary acidic protein from bovine and rat brain. Degradation in tissues and homogenates. Compared with human material glial fibrillary acidic protein isolated from bovine, rat and mouse brain was remarkably homogeneous and migrated as a single band at 54 000 mol. wt. on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The protein was extremely susceptible to proteolysis and lower molecular weight components were invariably isolated together with the major species when the brain was not rapidly frozen. Further degradation of the 54 000 mol wt. polypeptide in bovine tissues incubated at 24 degrees C resulted in preparations essentially identical to those previously isolated from human autopsy material and separating into a series of immunologically active polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 54 000 to approximately 40 500. The gel band pattern obtained after progressively longer periods of autolysis suggested that small fragments were cleaved from the original polypeptide in successive steps of degradation. As in human brain, the lower molecular weight products in the 45 000-40 500 range were more resistant to proteolysis and still present after prolonged periods of tissue autolysis. The effect of the pH and of proteinase inhibitors on degradation was studied in homogenates of bovine brain stem incubated at 37 degrees C. At pH 8.0 PROTEOLYSIS OF The glial fibrillary acidic protein followed essentially the same pattern as in tissue. Cleavage of the major species was not prevented by the addition of proteinase inhibitors. At pH 6.0 and 6.5 a different type of degradation was observed, with rapid breakdown of the protein and loss of immunological activity. Increased solubility in buffer solutions was another effect of autolysis. Compared with cerebral cortex and brain stem, where most of the protein was water soluble, only a small fraction was extracted with buffer from bovine white matter. However, the solubility markedly increased following incubation and comparable amounts were extracted in buffer and in 6 M urea.\n",
      "Studies on the binding of haemoglobin by haptoglobin using electrofocusing and gradient electrophoresis. 1. Gel electrofocusing followed by gel gradient electrophoresis separated the haptoglobins and their complexes with haemoglobin into characteristic two-dimensional patterns of protein bands. 2. Molecular weights of 107 000, 139 000 and 168 000 were obtained for the three bands seen after a purified preparation of haptoglobin type 1 was partially saturated with haemoglobin. This indicated that free haptoglobin, the intermediate haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex containing one half-haemoglobin and the saturated complex with two half-haemoglobins were present. 3. The three proteins showed considerable microheterogeneity and gave a number of isoelectric points in the pH ranges 4.58-4.77, 5.20-5.40 and 5.74-5.93, free haptoglobin type 1 being the lowest group. These ranges were all 0.15-0.30pH units lower if other values were taken for the isoelectric points of markers used to calibrate the pH gradient. 4. All three proteins were present over a wide range of haemoglobin concentrations, from 0.5% to 92% of that required for saturation. This would be expected if both binding sites have similar affinities for haemoglobin.\n",
      "Cytochrome P450cam and its complexes. Mössbauer parameters of the heme iron. Mössbauer spectroscopy has been used to study the heme iron in various states of cytochrome P450cam from the camphor-hydroxylating system of the bacterium Pseudomonas putida. Native, camphor-free P450cam contains low-spin ferric iron, part of which (approx. 50-70%) is converted to the high-spin ferric state upon addition of camphor. The Mössbauer spectra of the camphor-free enzyme (S equals 1/2) and of the high-spin component (S equals 5/2) of the camphor complex have been successfully simulated using a model based on crystal-field theory and simple convalency considerations. The native low-spin ferric state of P450cam forms a complex with 2-phenylimidazole, with small changes in the g values and Mössbauer spectra. These changes can be accounted for consistently in the crystal-field model referred to above. The addition of putidaredoxin to the camphor-complexed, oxidized P450cam decreases the intensity of the high-spin component and changes its quadrupole splitting. The reduced form of P450cam contrins high-spin ferrous iron, both in the presence and absence of camphor. The complex of reduced P450cam with molecular oxygen is diamagnetic and has a combination of quadrupole splitting and isomer shift that is unusual for a ferrous complex, but strongly resembles that of oxyhemoglobin. These results are compatible with the bound superoxide, Fe3+-O-2, model proposed for oxyhemoglobin (Weiss, J. J. (1964) Nature 202, 83-84). Reduced P450cam and its complexes, oxyP450cam-CO, are all found to be analogous in some respects to the corresponding hemoglobin complexes.\n",
      "Cross partition and determination of net charge of the isoenzymes of enolase. Enolase from bakers' yeast was separated into three isoenzymes by countercurrent distribution. The isoenzymes were partitioned in aqueous polymer two-phase systems containing positively charged trimethylamino poly(ethylene glycol) or negatively charged poly(ethylene glycol) sulphonate. The plots of the partition coefficient of each isoenzyme versus pH in the two biphasic systems intersect at pH equal to the isoelectric point. From slopes of the plots, the net charge of the isoenzymes at pH 6.57 was determined to be +2, -3, and -8 respectively.\n",
      "Avoidance of strongly chaotropic eluents for immunoaffinity chromatography by chemical modification of immobilized ligand. The need for chaotropic eluents in immunoaffinity chromatography is a consequence of the high affinities of antibodies towards their antigens. This affinity is decreased and elution of antiglucagon antibodies from a column of immobilized glucagon can be achieved under mild conditions when the steric complementarity to the antibody binding site is perturbed by selective chemical modification of the hormone. The effects of reaction with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, tetranitromethane and hydrogen peroxide have been studied. Conversely, treatment of immobilized antibodies with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide facilitates the elution of glucagon during immunoaffinity chromatography. The general implications of these results are discussed.\n",
      "Release and activation of a particulate bound acid phosphatase from Tetrahymena pyriformis. A sedimentable form of acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) from Tetrahymena pyriformis was found to be solubilized by Triton X-100. The total enzyme activity in the insoluble cell fraction increased almost 200% upon solubilization with Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40. Removal of membrane lipids and Triton X-100 from the particulate wash solution with a chloroform extraction resulted in non-specific enzyme-protein aggregation which was reversible upon addition of Triton X-100. The results indicate that this acid phosphatase is an integral membrane protein. The pH optima for this particulate bound acid phosphatase was 3.5 with o-carboxyphenyl phosphate and 4.0 with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrates. The Km values of each substrate were 3.1 and 0.031 mM, respectively.\n",
      "Partial purification and characterization of post-proline cleaving enzyme: enzymatic inactivation of neurohypophyseal hormones by kidney preparations of various species. The inactivation of the neurohypophyseal hormones arginine vasopressin and oxytocin, both 14C-labelled in the C-terminal glycine residue, by enzymes present in kidney homogenates of various species has been investigated, and some of the enzymes responsible have been partially purified and characterized. The Leu-Gly peptide bond of oxytocin is generally most effectively cleaved by kidney homogenates, although with certain species enzymic activity hydrolyzing the Pro-Leu bond is significant. Degradation of arginine vasopressin is slower than oxytocin in all species studied, and appears to occur by a different overall mechanism since cleavage of the Pro-Arg bond is more significant than hydrolysis of the Arg-Gly bond. The enzyme releasing glycinamide from oxytocin and the \"Post-Proline Cleaving Enzyme\", which releases C-terminal dipeptide from oxytocin and arginine vasopressin, were partially purified from lamb kidney by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography. The two enzymes are shown to be separate entities with different pH profiles. The prolyl peptidase activity released the C-terminal dipeptides from oxytocin and arginine vasopressin at similar rates and was inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, 1,10-phenanthroline, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone, Co2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+, but significantly enhanced by dithiothreitol. The prolyl peptidase preparation cleaves proline-containing peptide substrates at the Pro-X bond. The rate of cleavage is dependent on the nature of residue X and with the conditions used there is no cleavage when X equals Pro; however, cleavage occurs when X is a D isomer: [Mpr1, D-Arg8] vasopressin is inactivated at a rate similar to [Mpr1, Arg8]- and [Mpr1, Lys8] vasopressin, suggesting that the known prolonged biological action of [Mpr1, D-Arg8] vasopressin is not due to resistance to the prolyl peptidase. In all characteristics tested the lamb kidney prolyl peptidase was identical to the post-proline cleaving enzyme isolated earlier from human uterus. In vivo experiments in the cat suggested that both the glycinamide-releasing enzyme and post-proline cleaving enzyme are present and effective in inactivating neurohypophyseal hormones in the intact animal.\n",
      "Adenosine phosphyorylase activity as distinct from inosine-guanosine phosphorylase activity in Sarcoma 180 cells and rat liver. Adenosine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.-) activity present in Sarcoma 180 cells grown in culture and in rat liver, is shown to be distinct from inosine-guanosine phosphorylase by several criteria: (a) treatment of Sarcoma 180 cell extract with p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited the two activities to a different extent, (b) adenine selectively protected the adenosine phosphorylase activity of Sarcoma 180 and rat liver extract against heat inactivation, while hypoxanthine selectively protected inosine-guanosine phosphorylase activity, (c) at nearly saturating substrate concentrations and using Sarcoma 180 extract, the rates of ribosylation of a mixture of adenine + hypoxanthine or adenine + guanine, but not of hypoxanthine + guanine, were found to be almost equal to the sum of their individual rates as measured separately, (d) inosine selectively inhibited the ribosylation of hypoxanthine and guanine catalysed by Sarcoma 180 and rat liver extract while 2-chloroadenosine selectively inhibited the ribosylation of adenine and N6-furfuryladenine, (e) pH vs. activity curves were similar with hypoxanthine or guanine as the substrate but they were markedly different from the curve with adenine as the substrate. The potential role of adenosine phosphorylase activity in vivo is discussed.\n",
      "Purification and properties of an alpha-amylase inhibitor from wheat. Four inhibitors of alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) were separated from an alcohol extract of wheat by ion-exchange chromatography on DE52-cellulose. One inhibitor, which showed the greatest specificity for human salivary amylase relative to human pancreatic amylase, has been purified by the following steps: (a) alcohol fractionation (60--90%) of water extract (b) ion-exchange chromatography on QAE-Sephadex A-50; (c) re-chromatography on DE52-cellulose and (d) gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. The purified inhibitor is 100 times more specific for human salivary amylase than for human pancreatic amylase. It shows an electrophoretic mobility of 0.2 on disc gel electrophoresis and a molecular weight of about 21 000. This inhibitor contributes about 16% to the total salivary amylase inhibiting power of the wheat extract.\n",
      "Purification and specificity of prolyl dipeptidase from bovine kidney. Prolyl dipeptidase (iminodipeptidase, L-prolyl-amino acid hydrolase, EC 3.4.13.8) was purified 180-fold from bovine kidney. The enzyme which was obtained in a 10% yield was completely separated from a number of known kidney peptidases including an enzyme of very similar substrate specificity, proline aminopeptidase (L-prolyl-peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.11.5). The specific activity of the enzyme with L-prolylglycine as substrate is 1600 units of activity per mg protein. Optimum activity of the enzyme is at pH 8.75 and the molecular weight on gel filtration was estimated to be 100 000. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is pH 4.25. Studies of substrate specificity showed that the enzyme preferentially hydrolyzes dipeptides and dipeptidyl amides with L-proline or hydroxy-L-proline at the N-terminus. Longer chain substrates with N-terminal proline were not hydrolyzed.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of beta-glucosidase from the cytosol of rat kidney cortex. A procedure is described for the preparation of extensively purified beta-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) from the cytosol fraction of rat kidney. The specific activity of the beta-glucosidase in the high speed supernatant (100 000 X g, 90 min) fraction of rat kidney homogenate is 700-fold greater than that in the same fraction from heart, skeletal muscle, lung, spleen, brain or liver. beta-Glucosidase activity co-chromatographs with beta-D-galactosidase, beta-D-fucosidase, alpha-L-arabinosidase and beta-D-xylosidase activities through the last four column steps of the purification and their specific activities are 0.26, 0.39, 0.028 and 0.017 relative to that of beta-glucosidase, respectively. The specific activity of the apparently homogeneous beta-glucosidase is 115 000 nmol of glucose released from 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside per mg protein per h. All five glycosidase activities possess similar pH dependency (pH optimum, 6--7) and heat lability, and co-migrate on polyacrylamide disc gels at pH 8.9 (RF, 0.67). beta-Glucosidase acitivity is inhibited competitively by glucono-(1 leads to 5)-lactone (KI, 0.61 mM) and non-competitively by a variety of sulfhydryl reagents including N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and iodoacetic acid. Although the enzyme will release glucose from p-nitrophenyl and 4-methylumbelliferyl derivatives of beta-D-glucose, it will not hydrolyze xylosyl-O-serine, beta-D-glucocerebroside, lactose, galactosylovalbumin or trehalose. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 50 000--58 000, has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.41 S and contains a relatively large number of acidic amino acids. A study of the distribution of beta-glucosidase activity in various regions of the dissected rat kidney indicates that the enzyme is probably contained in cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. The enzyme is also present in relatively large amounts in the villus cells, but not crypt cells, of the intestine. The physiological substrate and function of the enzyme are unknown.\n",
      "Studies on (Na+ + K+)-activated ATPase. XXXVIII. A 100 000 molecular weight protein as the low-energy phosphorylated intermediate of the enzyme. Phosphorylation of NaI-treated bovine brain cortex microsomes by inorganic phosphate in the presence of Mg2+ and ouabain has been studied at 0 degrees C (pH 7.4) and 20 degrees C (pH 7.0). Nearly maximal (90%) and half-maximal phosphorylation are achieved at 20 degrees C within 2 min with 50--155 and 5.6--17 muM 32Pi, respectively, and at 0 degrees C within 75 s with 300--600 and 33--66 muM 32Pi, respectively. Maximal phosphorylation yields 146 pmol 32P - mg-1 protein. Without ouabain (20 degrees C, pH 7.0) less than 25% of the incorporation observed in the presence of ouabain is reached. Preincubation of the native microsomes with Mg2+ and K+, in order to decompose possibly present high-energy phosphoryl-bonds prior to ouabain treatment, does not affect the maximal phosphate incorporation. This indicates that the inorganic phosphate incorporation is not due to an exchange with high-energy phosphoryl-bonds, which might have been preserved in the microsomal preparations. Phosphorylation of the native microsomes by ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ reaches 90 and 50% maximal levels within 15--30 s at 0 degrees C and pH 7.4 at concentrations of [gamma-32P]ATP of 5--32 and 0.5--3.5 muM, respectively. The maximal phosphorylation level is 149 pmol 32P-mg-1 protein, equal to that of ouabain-treated microsomes phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate. Both inorganic phosphate and ATP phosphorylate on site per active enzyme subunit of 135 000 molecular weight. From the equilibrium constants for the phosphorylation of ouabain-treated microsomes by inorganic phosphate at 0 degrees C and 20 degrees C standard free-energy changes of --5.4 and --6.8 kcal/mol, respectively, are calculated. These values yield a standard enthalpy change of 14 kcal/mol and an entropy change of 70 cal/mol - degree K. This characterizes the reaction as a process driven by an entropy change. The intermediate formed by phosphorylation with Pi has maximal stability at acidic pH, as is the case for the intermediate formed with ATP. Solubilization in sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilizes the phosphoryl-bond in the pH range of 4--7. The non-solubilized preparation has optimal stability at pH 2--4, the level of which is equal to that of detergent-solubilized intermediate. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the microsomes at pH 3, following incorporation of 32Pi yields 11 protein bands, only one of which (mol. wt 100 000--106 000) carries the radioactive label. This protein has the same molecular weight as the protein, which is phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+.\n",
      "Partial purification and properties of a chromatin-associated phosphoprotein kinase from rat liver nuclei. A phosphoprotein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) KIVb, from rat liver nuclei, was purified 75-fold by phosphocellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The enzyme, which has an apparent molecular weight of 55 000, phosphorylates casein and chromatin-bound nonhistone proteins more readily than histones or ribosomal proteins. It exhibits an absolute requirement for divalent cation with optimum activity at 15--20 mM Mg2+. Maximal kinase activity is achieved at 100 mM NaCl. The pH vs. activity curve is biphasic with optima at pH 6.5 and pH 8.0. The Km value for casein is 280 mug/ml and the Km for ATP is 6-10(-6) M. Kinase KIVb phosphorylates numerous nonhistone nuclear proteins as shown by electrophoretic analysis. The addition of kinase KIVb to reaction mixtures containing nonhistone proteins results in the phosphorylation of a spectrum of polypeptides similar to those that are phosphorylated by endogenous nuclear kinases. Nonhistone proteins bound to chromatin appear to be better substrates for KIVb than nonhistones dissociated from chromatin. A comparison of nuclear phosphoproteins phosphorylated either in the intact animal or in vitro (by the addition of kinase KIVb) indicates some differences and some similarities in the patterns of phosphorylation.\n",
      "Purification and some properties of rat liver cysteine oxidase (cysteine dioxygenase). Cysteine oxidase (cysteine dioxygenase, EC 1.13.11.20) was purified approximately 1000-fold from rat liver. The purified enzyme (protein-B) was obtained as an inactive form, which was activated by anaerobic preincubation with L-cysteine. The active form of protein-B was inactivated during aerobic incubation to produce cysteine sulfinate. This inactivation of protein-B was protected by a distinct protein in rat liver cytoplasm, namely stabilizing protein (protein-A). The Ka and Km values for L-cysteine were 0.8-10(-3) M and 1.3-10(-3) M respectively. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by Cu+ and/or Fe2+ chelating agents but not by Cu2+ chelating agent. The optimum pH of enzyme reaction was 8.5-9.5 while that of enzyme activation was 6.8-9.5, with a broad peak.\n",
      "Conformations of lysine-sensitive aspartokinase. 1. The technique of differential thermal and proteolytic inactivation has been employed as a conformational probe for the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase (EC 2.7.2.4) of Escherichia coli B. 2. L-Amino acid inhibitors of this enzyme each induce a characteristic enzyme conformation. This is evidenced by rates of thermal and proteolytic inactivation and Arrhenius activation energies for thermal inactivation which are characteristic of the amino acid present. 3. Phenylalanine and leucine binding are mutually exclusive as evidenced by competitive behavior in thermal inactivation experiments, suggesting a hydrophobic amino acid binding site with broad specificity. 4. The phenylalanine-dependent conformation and the leucine-dependent conformation differ considerably. In comparison with the native enzyme, the former is more labile to proteolysis by trypsin whereas the latter is more stable. First-order rate constants for thermal inactivation of the phenylalanine- and leucine-dependent conformations are, respectively, about one-half and one-tenth that of the native enzyme. 5. Items 3 and 4 taken together suggest that the conformations are ligand induced and do not arise via ligand stabilization of spontaneously arising conformers.\n",
      "The sulphatase of ox liver. XIX. On the nature of the polymeric forms of sulphatase A present in dilute solutions. Weight-average elution volumes of sulphatase A (an arylsulphate sulphohydrolase, EC 3.1.6.1) from Sephadex G-200 have been determined as functions of protein concentration, pH, ionic strength and temperature. The results are used to calculate the apparent association equilibrium constants for tetramer formation and the associated standard-state thermodynamic parameters. While the apparent association constant decreased from 10(28) to 10(21) M-3 on increasing the pH from 4.5 to 5.6 at ionic strength 0.1, at any particular pH value studied it was relatively insensitive to temperature variation so that deltaH is close to zero and tetramer formation in solution is associated with a positive entropy change. At pH 5.0, increasing the ionic strength from 0.1 to 2 decreased the association constant by a factor of 100. Methylumbelliferone sulphate has no effect on the association of sulphatase A. The equilibrium results are used to define the degree of association of sulphatase A likely to encountered in experiments designed to elucidate its kinetic properties. In the liver lysosome, the tetramer is probably the dominant species. The monomer and tetramer of sulphatase A have similar, or identical, specific activities with nitrocatechol sulphate and 4-methylumbelliferone sulphate as substrates. With nitrocatechol sulphate, sulphatase A shows Michaelis kinetics under conditions where the monomer is the dominant species and non-Michaelis kinetics where the tetramer is dominant. There is apparently a negative cooperativity between the monomer units in the tetramer. In 2 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate and 0.035 M MnCl2, but not in 0.1 M NaCl, the tetramer shows Michaelis kinetics. This is not due to dissociation of the tetramer. The critical micellar concentration of sodium taurodeoxycholate is about 0.8 mM in both 0.1 M NaCl and 0.035 M McCl2 but the aggregation number is greater in the latter.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of an extracellular exo-D-galacturonanase of Aspergillus niger. A D-galacturonanase (EC 3.2.1.67) catalyzing the degradation of D-galacturonans by terminal action pattern was purified from a culture filtrate of Aspergillus niger by a procedure including the salting-out with ammonium sulfate, precipitation by ethanol, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and gel chromatography on Sephadex G-100. The obtained preparation was slightly contaminated by an enzymically inactive protein fraction. Maximum activity and stability of the enzyme was observed at pH 5.2. The enzyme degrades digalacturonic acid, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranuronide, as well as oligogalacturonides containing at the nonreducing end 4-deoxy-L-threo-hexa-4-enopyranosyluronate. It differs from all A. niger enzymes so far described which degrade D-galaturonans by the terminal action pattern, in not clearly preferring low-molecular substrates. It is therefore classified as an exo-D-galacturonanase.\n",
      "The biosynthesis of multi-L-arginyl-poly(L-aspartic acid) in the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica. The cyanobacteria produce multi-L-arginyl-poly (aspartic acid), a high molecular weight (Mr=25 000-125 000) branched polypeptide consisting of a poly(aspartic acid) core with L-arginyl residues peptide bonded to each free carboxyl group of the poly(aspartic acid). An enzyme which will elongate Arg-poly(Asp) has been isolated and purified 92-fold from the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica. The enzyme incorporates arginine and aspartic acid into Arg-poly(Asp) in a reaction which requires ATP, KCl, MgCl2, and a sulfhydryl reagent. The enzymatic incorporation of arginine is dependent upon the presence of L-aspartic acid but not visa versa, a finding which suggests the order of amino acid addition to the branched polypeptide-aspartic acid is added to the core followed by the attachment of an arginine branch. The elongation of Arg-poly(Asp) in-vitro is insensitive to the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors and to the addition of nucleases. These findings support the notion previosly suggested from in-vivo studies that Arg-poly(Asp) is synthesized via a non-ribosomal route and also demonstrate that amino-acetylated transfer-RNAs play no part in at least one step of the biosynthetic mechanism.\n",
      "Separation of subchloroplast membrane particles by counter-current distribution. Counter-current distribution in an aqueous Dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase system has been used to fractionate membrane fragments obtained by press treatment of Class II chloroplasts. By the counter-current distribution technique membrane particles are separated according to their surface properties such as charge and hydrophobicity. The fractions obtained were analysed with respect to photochemical activities, chlorophyll and P-700 contents. The Photosystem II enrichment after counter-current distribution was better than that obtained by differential centrifugation of the disrupted chloroplasts. However, the best separation of Photosystem I and II enriched particles could be achieved if differential centrifugation was combined with the counter-current distribution technique. Each centrifugal fraction could be further separated into Photosystems I and II enriched fractions since the Photosystem II particles preferred the dextran-rich bottom phase while the Photosystem I particles preferred the polyethylene glycol-rich top phase. By this procedure it was possible, without the use of detergents, to obtain vesicles which were more enriched in Photosystem II as compared to intact grana stacks. The partition behaviour of undisrupted Class II chloroplasts and the Photosystem I centrifugal fraction was the same. This similarity indicated that the membrane which is exposed to the surrounding polymers by the Class II chloroplasts is the Photosystem I rich membrane of the stroma lamellae.\n",
      "Stimulation of ATP synthesis in Halobacterium halobium R1 by light-induced or artifically created proton electrochemical potential gradients across the cell membrane. The relationship between proton movement and phosphorylation in Halo-bacterium halobium R1 has been investigated under anaerobic conditions. The light-induced changes in the bacteriorhodopsin are accompanied by proton movements across the membrane which result in pH changes in the suspending medium. The initial alkaline shift is shown to be closely paralleled by (and hence correlated with) ATP synthesis. Acidification of the medium in the presence of valinomycin, under conditions of low external potassium, brings about ATP synthesis in the dark.\n",
      "Mechanism of active shrinkage in mitochondria. II. Coupling between strong electrolyte fluxes. 1. Addition of succinate to valinomycin-treated mitochondria incubated in KCL causes a large electrolyte penetration. The process depends on a steady supply of energy and involves a continuous net extrusion of protons. Rates of respiration and of electrolyte penetration proceed in a parallel manner. 2. A passive penetration of K+ salt of permeant anions occurs in respiratory-inhibited mitochondria after addition of valinomycin. Addition of succinate at the end of the passive swelling starts an active extrusion of anions and cations with restoration of the initial volume. The shrinkage is accompanied by a slow reuptake of protons. The initiation of the active shrinkage correlates with the degree of stretching of the inner membrane. The extrusion of electrolytes is inhibited by nigericin, while it is only slightly sensitive to variations of the valinomycin concentration larger than two orders of magnitude. 3. Passive swelling and active shrinkage occurs also when K+ is replaced by a large variety of organic cations. The rate of organic cation penetration is enhanced by tetraphenylboron, while the rate of electrolyte extrusion is insensitive to variation of the tetraphenylboron concentration. 4. Active shrinkage, either with K+ or organic cation salts, is inhibited by weak acids. The phosphate inhibition is removed by SH inhibitors. The active shrinkage is also inhibited by mersalyl to an extent of about 60%. 5. Three models of active shrinkage are discussed: (a) mechanoprotein, (b) electrogenic proton pump, and (c) proton-driven cation anion pump.\n",
      "Inhibitory effect of p-nitrothiophenol in the light on the photosystem II activity of spinach chloroplasts. The treatment of spinach chloroplasts with p-nitrothiophenol in the light at acidic and neutral pH'S caused specific inhibition of the Photosystem II activity, whereas the same treatment in the dark did not affect the activity at all. The photosystem I activity was not inhibited by p-nitrothiophenol both in the light and in the dark. The inhibition was accompanied by changes of fluorescence from chloroplasts. As observed at room temperature, the 685-nm band was lowered by the p-nitrothiophenol treatment in the light and, at liquid nitrogen temperature, the relative height of the 695-nm band to the 685-nm band increased and the 695-nm band shifted to longer wavelengths. The action spectra for these effects of p-nitrothiophenol on the activity and fluorescence showed a peak at 670 nm with a red drop at longer wavelengths. It was concluded that the light absorbed by Photosystem II is responsible for the chemical modification of chloroplasts with p-nitrothiopehnol to causing the specific inhibition of Photosystem II.\n",
      "Relations between the electrical potential, pH gradient, proton flux and phosphorylation in the photosynthetic membrane. The transmembrane electrical potential (deltaphi), the proton flux (H+), the rate of electron transport (e), the pH gradient (deltapH) and the rate of phosphorylation (ATP) were measured in chloroplasts of spinach. Photosynthesis was excited periodically with flashes of variable frequencies and intensities. A new method is described for determining the rate of electron transport and proton flux. Under conditions where the rate of electron transport and proton flux are not pH controlled the following correlations were found in the range 50 mV less than or equal to deltaphi less than or equal to 125 mV and 1.8 less than or equal to deltapH less than or equal to 2.7: (1) The pH gradient, deltapH, increases with H+ independently of Phout between 7-9. (2) The rate of phosphorylation, ATP, depends exponentially on deltapH (at constant deltaphi) and is independent of pHout between 7-9. (3) The rate of phosphorylation, ATP, depends also on deltaphi (at constant deltapH and at constant proton flux H+). (4) The proton flux via the ATPase pathway, Hp+, depends non-linearly on the ratio of the proton concentrations: Hp+ approximately (Hin+/Hout+)b, (b=2.3--2.6). The proton flux via the basal pathway, Hb+, depends linearly on the ratio of the proton concentrations: Hb+ approximately (Hin/Hout). (5) The ratio deltaH+/ATP (e/ATP, i.e. the ratio of the total proton flux, Hp+ + Hb+, and the rate of ATP formation, ATP, depends strongly on deltaphi and on deltapH. The ratio is deltaH+/ATP approximately 3 (e/ATP approximately 1.5) at deltapH 2.7 and deltaphi = 125 mV. (6) It is supposed that the reason for the dependence of deltaH+/ATP on deltaphi anddeltapH is the different functional dependence of the basal proton flux Hb+ and the phosphorylating proton flux Hp+ on deltapH and deltaphi. The calculation of deltaH+/ATP on the basis of this assumption is in fair agreement with the experimental values. Also the \"threshold\" effects can be explained in this way. (7) The ratio of deltaHp+/ATP, i.e. the ratio of the phosphorylating proton flux Hp+ and ATP, is deltaHp+/ATP APPROXIMATELY 2.4.\n",
      "A possible mechanism of the generation of singlet molecular oxygen in nadph-dependent microsomal lipid peroxidation. A simplified system, consisting of NADPH, Fe3+-ADP, EDTA, liposomes, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and Tris - HCl buffer (pH 6.8), has been employed in studies of the generation of singlet oxygen in NADPH-dependent microsomal lipid peroxidation. The light emitted by the system involves 1deltag type molecular oxygen identifiable by its characteristic emission spectrum and its behavior with beta-carotene. The generation of another excited species (a compound in the triplet state) could be demonstrated in this system by changes of light intensity and emission spectra which arise from photosensitizer (9,10-dibromoanthracene sulfonate, eosin, Rose-Bengal)-mediated energy transfers. Chemiluminescence in the visible region was markedly quenched by various radical trappers and by an inhibitor of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, but not by superoxide dismutase. During the early stage of lipid peroxidation, the intensity of chemiluminescence was proportional to the square of the concentration of lipid peroxide. These characteristics suggest that singlet oxygen and a compound in the triplet state (probably a carbonyl compound) are generated by a self-reaction of lipid peroxy radicals.\n",
      "Primary reactions of photosystem II at low pH. I. Prompt and delayed fluorescence. Prompt and delayed chlorophyll fluorescence have been studied in broken spinach chloroplasts at pH values down to 2.6. No direct effect of low pH on the primary charge separation in Photosystem II was observed. The irreversible inactivation of a secondary electron donor in a narrow pH range around pH 4.5 was demonstrated. At lower pH values the photooxidized form of a more primary electron donor, revealed by its efficient fluorescence quenching, was reduced with a half time of about 200 mus, 25% by another electron donor and 75% by back reaction with the reduced acceptor. The electron donation had a half time of 800 mus and was practically irreversible. The back reaction had a pH dependent half time: about 270 mus at pH 4 and increasing towards lower pH. The competition of both reactions resulted in a net efficiency of the charge separation at pH 4 of 25%, increasing towards lower pH.\n",
      "Immunological similarity between NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of erythrocytes and liver microsomes. In a number of animal species soluble NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of erythrocytes was compared with membrane-bound NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of liver microsomes by using an antibody to purified NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase from rat liver microsomes. The results obtained indicated clearly that they are immunologically very similar to each other. The data with erythrocyte ghosts suggested that cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase are also present in the ghost.\n",
      "Effect of NADP on light-induced cytochrome changes in membrane fragments from a blue-green alga. The effect of NADP+ on light-induced steady-state redox changes of membrane-bound cytochromes was investigated in membrane fragements prepared from the blue-green algae Nostoc muscorum (Strain 7119) that had high rates of electron transport from water to NADP+ and from an artificial electron donor, reduced dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIPH2) to NDAP+. The membrane fragments contained very little phycocyanin and had excellent optical properties for spectrophotometric assays. With DCIPH2 as the electron donor, NADP+ had no effect on the light-induced redox changes of cytochromes: with or without NADP+, 715- or 664-nm illumination resulted mainly in the oxidation of cytochrome f and of other component(s) which may include a c-type cytochrome with an alpha peak at 549nm. With 664 nm illumination and water as the electron donor, NADP+ had a pronounced effect on the redox state of cytochromes, causing a shift toward oxidation of a component with a peak at 549 nm (possibly a c-type cytochrome), cytochrome f, and particularly cytochrome b559. Cytochrome b559 appeared to be a component of the main noncyclic electron transport chain and was photooxidized at physiological temperatures by Photosystem II. This photooxidation was apparent only in the presence of a terminal acceptor (NADP+) for the electron flow from water.\n",
      "Kinetic studies on cytochrome c oxidase by combined epr and reflectance spectroscopy after rapid freezing. 1. Techniques and experiments are described concerned with the millisecond kinetics of EPT-detectable changes brought about in cytochrome c oxidase by reduced cytochrome c and, after reduction with various agents, by reoxidation with O2 or ferricyanide. Some experiments in the presence of ligands are also reported. Light absorption was monitored by low-temperature reflectance spectroscopy. 2. In the rapid phase of reduction of cytochrome c oxidase by cytochrome c (less than 50 ms) approx. 0.5 electron equivalent per heme a is transferred mainly to the low-spin heme component of cytochrome c oxidase and partly to the EPR-detectable copper. In a slow phase (less than 1 s) the copper is reoxidized and high-spin ferric heme signals appear with a predominant rhombic component. Simultaneously the absorption band at 655 nm decreases and the Soret band at 444 nm appears between the split Soret band (442 and 447 nm) of reduced cytochrome a. 3. On reoxidation of reduced enzyme by oxygen all EPR and optical features are restored within 6 ms. On reoxidation by O2 in the presence of an excess of reduced cytochrome c, states can be observed where the low-spin heme and copper signals are largely absent but the absorption at 655 nm is maximal, indicating that the low-spin heme and copper components are at the substrate side and the component(s) represented in the 655 nm absorption at the O2 side of the system. On reoxidation with ferricyanide the 655 nm absorption is not readily restored but a ferric high-spin heme, represented by a strong rhombic signal, accumulates. 4. On reoxidation of partly reduced enzyme by oxygen, the rhombic high-spin signals disappear within 6 ms., whereas the axial signals disappear more slowly, indicating that these species are not in rapid equilibrium. Similar observations are made when partly reduced enzyme is mixed with CO. 5. The results of this and the accompanying paper are discussed and on this basis an assignment of the major EPR signals and of the 655 nm absorption is proposed, which in essence is that published previously (Hartzell, C.R., Hansen, R.E. and Beinert, H. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. 70, 2477-2481). Both the low-spin (g=o; 2.2; 1.5) and slowly appearing high-spin (g=6; 2) signals are attributed to ferric cytochrome a, whereas the 655 nm absorption is thought to arise from ferric cytochrome a3, when it is present in a state of interaction with EPR-undectectable copper. Alternative possibilities and possible inconsistencies with this proposal are discussed.\n",
      "Some thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the primary photochemical reactants in a complex from a green photosynthetic bacterium. We have examined the bacteriochlorophyll reaction-center complex of Chlorobium limicola f. thiosulfatophilum, strain Tassajara. Our results indicate that the midpoint potential of the primary electron donor bacteriochlorophyll of the reaction center is +250 mV at pH 6.8, while that of cytochrome c-553 is +165 mV. There are two cytochrome c-553 hemes per reaction center, and the light-induced oxidation of each is biphasic (t1/2 of less than 5 mus and approximately 50 mus). We belive that this indicates a two state equilibrium with each cytochrome heme being either close to, or a little removed from, the reaction-center bacteriochlorophyll. We have also titrated the primary electron acceptor of the reaction center. Its equilibrium midpoint potential at pH 6.8 is below -450 mV. This is very much lower than the previous estimate for green bacteria, and also substantially lower than values obtained for purple bacteria. Such a low-potential primary acceptor would be thermodynamically capable of direct reduction of NAD+ via ferredoxin in a manner analagous to photosystem I in chloroplasts and blue-green algae.\n",
      "Reaction of uracil and thymine derivatives with sodium bisulfite. Studies on the mechanism and reduction of the adduct. The rates and equilibria for the addition of sodium bisulfite to uracil, thymine, and their nucleosides have been studied for the pH range 3-9.5. The rate of addition for uracil is proportional to the concentration of sulfite ion and unionized uracil. The equilibrium constant (25 degrees C) for the reaction is (1.0 +/- 0.15) X 10(3) 1 - mol-1 for uracil and 0.62 +/- 0.03 1- mol-1 for thymine. A pH of 6-7, with a high bisulfite concentration is suggested for biochemical applications of the uracil reaction. The uracil reaction, which proceeds readily under physiological conditions and has a high equilibrium constant, may be a contributing cause of the biochemical effects of bisulfite and sulfur dioxide. Additional evidence on the structure of the thymine-bisulfite adduct has been obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This spectrum supports the assignment of structure as dihydrothymine-6-sulfonate. The uracil-bisulfite adduct is reduced by sodium borohydride to sodium 3-ureido-propanol-2-sulfonate. This reaction is suggested for the chemical modification of nucleic acids.\n",
      "Intramembrane particle aggregation in erythrocyte ghosts. II. The influence of spectrin aggregation. Physicochemical properties of mixtures of spectrin and actin extracted from human erythrocyte ghosts have been correlated with ultrastructural changes observed in freeze-fractured erythrocyte membranes. (1) Extracted mixtures of spectrin and actin have a very low solubility (less than 30 mug/ml) near their isoelectric point, pH 4.8. These mixtures are also precipitated by low concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, polylysine or basic proteins. (2) All conditions which precipitate extracts of spectrin and actin also induce aggregation of the intramembrane particles in spectrin-depleted erythrocyte ghosts. Precipitation of the residual spectrin molecules into small patches on the cytoplasmic surface of the ghost membrane is thought to be the cause of particle aggregations, implying an association between the spectrin molecules and the intramembrane particles. (3) When fresh ghosts are exposed to conditions which precipitate extracts of spectrin and actin, only limited particle aggregation occurs. Instead, the contraction of the intact spectrin meshwork induced by the precipitation conditions compresses the lipid bilayer of the membrane, causing it to bleb off particle-free, protein-free vesicles. (4) The absence of protein in these lipid vesicles implies that all the proteins of the erythrocyte membrane are immobilized by association with either the spectrin meshwork or the intramembrane particles.\n",
      "The rate of calcium uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle. Effects of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase b kinase. Calcium transport into sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments isolated from dog cardiac and mixed skeletal muscle (quadriceps) and from mixed fast (tibialis), pure fast (caudofemoralis) and pure slow (soleus) skeletal muscles from the cat was studied. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase b kinase stimulated the rate of calcium transport although some variability was observed. A specific protein kinase inhibitor prevented the effect of protein kinase but not of phosphorylase b kinase. The addition of cyclic AMP to the sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations in the absence of protein kinase had only a slight stimulatory effect despite the presence of endogenous protein kinase. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of several components present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments; a 19000 to 21 000 dalton peak was phosphorylated with high specific activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations isolated from heart and from slow skeletal muscle, but not from fast skeletal muscle. Phosphorylase b kinase phosphorylated a peak of molecular weight 95000 in all of the preparations. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-stimulated phosphorylation was optimum at pH 6.8; phosphorylase b kinase phosphorylation had a biphasic curve in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle with optima at pH 6.8 and 8.0. The addition of exogenous phosphorylase b kinase or protein kinase increased the endogenous level of phosphorylation 25-100%. All sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations contained varying amounts of adenylate cyclase, phosphorylase b and a (b:a = 30.1), \"debrancher\" enzyme and glycogen (0.3 mg/mg protein), as well as varying amounts of protein kinase and phosphorylase b kinase which were responsible for a significant endogenous phosphorylation. Thus, the two phosphorylating enzymes stimulated calcium uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of a variety of muscles possessing different physiologic characteristics and different responses to drugs. In addition, the phosphorylation catalyzed by these enzymes occurred at two different protein moieties which make physiologic interpretation of the role of phosphorylation difficult. While the role phosphorylation in these mechanisms is complex, the presence of a glycogenolytic enzyme system may be an important link in this phenomenon. The sarcoplasmic reticulum represents a new substrate for phosphorylase b kinase.\n",
      "[Microcolorimetric study of the association of trypsin with a pancreatic inhibitor]. Enthalpy of the association of trypsin with pancreatic inhibitor from bovine pancreas at 25 degrees C as a function of pH and ionic strength is estimated. The dependence of the enthalpy on pH is of an extremal character with a minimum at pH 7.6 (delta H degrees =-10.3 ccal/mole). The increase of ionic strength with the addition of LiCl, KCl and CsCl at pH 7.6 leads to be increase of delta H degrees. Possible mechanisms of enthlpy changes depending on medium conditions are considered.\n",
      "[Partial purification and properties of protease from Torula thermophila]. 11-Fold purified protease preparation is isolated from cultural medium of Torula thermophila UzPT-1 by means of ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel chromatography through Sephadex G-100. Disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two portease components, one of them possessing proteolytic activity. pH interval for protease activity was found to be 3.5-12, the maximal activity was observed at pH 8.5-11, the highest enzyme resistance--at pH 6-8. The enzyme almost completely preserved its activity for 1 hour in distilled water at 60 degrees C. The temperature maximum of the enzyme activity was 70 degrees at pH 8. The enzyme may be referred to proteases of serine nature, because it is completely inactivated with diisopropylphosphofluoridate, but it retains the activity in the presence of chelating agents (EDTA, o-phenantroline, ditizone) and inhibitors of SH-groups (sodium p-chloromercuriumbenzoate, iodoacetic acid). The enzyme was not inactivated with phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride and the trypsin inhibitor from soybean. The protease studied most efficiently hydrolyzed caseine and hemoglobin, in a less degree--human serum albumin and fibrinogen and almost did not attack egg albumin. The enzyme undergoes association-dissociation under pH change during gel filtration through Sephadex.\n",
      "[Various properties of the creatine transport system and the location of creatine kinase in skeletal muscle mitochondria]. Water and creatine contents were studied in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria after their 5 min. incubation in creatine solutions, pH 7.2 or 8.4. The content of water and creatine in mitochondria was found to be higher at pH 8.4, than at pH 72, the creatine content correlated with the water content. Structural creatine analogues, containing aminogroups with pKa greater than or equal to 9.5 or carboxyl groups, inhibited the infusion of creatine into mitochondria more strongly than substances having aminogroups with pKa less than 5. The penetrating form is creatine amphiion; the effect of pH on the permeability is probably due to the activation of the creatine transmitter. Rat skeletal muscle mitochondria contain creatine kinase at both sides of the inner membrane. This conclusion is based on the fact that under conditions, supplying the direct course of the creatine kinase reaction (the incubation medium contains Ca2+ and creatine; pH 7.8), ADP produces the stimulation of mitochondrial respiration up to the oxygen exhausting in a polarographic unit. Similarly, ADP irreversibly stimulates mitochondrial respiration in the presence of 1 mM EDTA, if EDTA and ADP are added after the preincubation of mitochondria in creatine-containing medium and after accumulating small amounts of Ca2+ by mitochondria.\n",
      "[Isolation and properties of a homogeneous L-asparaginase preparation from Pseudomonas fluorescens AG]. Highly purified L-asparaginase having a specific activity of 500+/- +/-40 IU./mg protein is isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens AG cells. The purification procedure includes isopropanol fractionation, gel filtration through Sephadex G-100, chromatography on hydroxylapatite and DEAE-cellulose columns. The asparaginase preparation is homogenous on the basis of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis data. The pH optimum is found to be 8.0-9.0, isoelectric point and molecular weight are 4.5+/-0.05 and 70,000+/-5,000 respectively, Km for L-asparagine being-4.1-10(-4)M. The enzyme does not hydrolyse L-glutamine. The hydrolysis rate of D-glutamine is less than 1% of the deamydation rate of L-isomer. p-Chloro-mercurium benzoate at a concentration of 10(-4) M completely inhibits the asparaginase activity. Asparaginase from Ps. fluorescens AG possesses and antileucosic activity, inhibiting 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA of Berkit lymphoma cells.\n",
      "[Analysis of sheep blood serum haptoglobin]. Three types of haptoglobin (Hp), differing in the number of bands of Hp--Hb complex on polyacrylamide gel electrophoregramm are found in sheep blood serum. HpA, HpB and HpC fractions included one, two-three and six-eight bands respectively. A modified procedure for the HpC isolation is described. Effects of urea, sodium dodecylsulpate, beta-mercaptoethanol, pH and maleinization on the behaviour of HpC under polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is studied. The data obtained suggest that the HpC molecule consists of two subunits (of alpha and beta types), bound with S--S bounds in an alphabeta-dimer, which form a whole HpC molecule for the expense of non-covalent bonds.\n",
      "[Reaction ability and alkylation kinetics of sulfhydride groups of soluble succinate dehydrogenase]. Inhibition kinetics of succinate--an acceptor of oxidoreductase activity of soluble succinate dehydrogenase by N-ethylmaleimide is studied. The alkylation reaction is described by the kinetic equation of the first order, its stechiometric coefficient being 1. The binding of enzyme sulphhydride groups by p-chloromercuriumbenzoate blocks the enzyme alkylation and its inhibition by oxaloacetate. Succinate protects succinate dehydrogenase from the inhibitory effect of N-ethylmaleimide. The reaction of the enzyme with an alkylating agent in the presence of different substrate concentrations corresponds kinetically to the model, according to which a sulphhydride group acts in the active site of the enzyme. pKa of this group is 7.0 at 20degreesC. The dependency of the maximal substrate oxidation reaction rate and that of the enzyme alkylation rate on pH coinside at the pH range 5.8--7.8. The presence of anions in the alkylation medium decreases the reaction ability of the active site with respect to N-ethylmaleimide. A mechanism of the initial stage of succinate oxidation with the cooperation of the sulphhydride group of the enzyme active site is postulated.\n",
      "[Effect of IAA on the photophosphorylation of pea isolated chloroplasts]. Effect of IAA (10(-10)-10(-3) M) on photophosphorylation, NADP reduction and the oxygen exchange is investigated. It is shown that low concentrations of IAA (10(-10)-10(-7) M) increase the photophosphorylation reaction and the flow of electrones to NADP under the phosphorylation conditions in the chloroplasts, and their effect on the O2 exchange is not the same in different types of photophosphorylation. It is supposed that the effect of IAA on the photophosphorylation is connected with H292 metabolism in chloroplasts and with catalase and peroxidase functions.\n",
      "[Purification, molecular multiplicity and kinetic properties of \"biosynthetic\" L-threonine dehydratase from E. coli K-12]. \"Biosynthetic\" L-threonine dehydratase was purified to homogeneous state with yield 29% of total activity from E. coli K-12. The cells were disrupted by means of ultra sound. Nucleic acids and nucleoproteins were precipitated with protamine sulphate, the proteins were fractioned with (NH4)2SO4, by gel filtration through Sephadex G-25 followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using stepways elution by changing the pH-values. The homogenity of the enzyme was shown by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis in the presence of dodecylsulphate. The enzyme consists of equal subunits having a molecular weight about 57000. The polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis had shown that the native enzyme consists of a set of oligomeric forms. The multiplisity of molecular organization of the enzyme was relfected in complicated kinetic behavior: at pH greater than 9 on the plots of initial reaction rate (upsilon) versus initial substrate concentration ([S]0) there were four inflexion points (two intermediate plateaux) the position and deepness of which depended on enzyme concentration. Kinetic properties of the highly purified enzyme and the enzyme in crude cell extracts at pH 9.3 and 7.4 were identical. At pH 8,3 on the upsilon versus [S]0 plots appeared two inflexion points (one intermediate plateau), the position of which practically did not depend on enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture but strongly depended on the enzyme concentration in the stock solution. Repeated polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis of several oligomeric forms isolated by the first electrophoresis had shown that oligomeric forms underwent a slow polymerization. It is suggested that \"biosynthetic\" L-threonine dehydratase from E. coli K-12 is a set of multiple oligomeric forms having different kinetic parameters. Probably, each form of the enzyme has a \"simple\" kinetics characterized by hyperbolic or sigmoidal shape of upsilon versus [S]0 plots. The rate of equilibrium between the oligomeric forms is small in comparison with the enzyme reaction velosity, that lead to the complex kinetic curves appearing as a result of summing up the kinetics inherent to the individual forms.\n",

Isoenzymes were purified about 5000 fold, and were found to be homogenous by disc electrophoresis in 7% polyacrylamide gel. It was found by comparative studies of activities of variants FF and SS, that pH optimum was 8.2 for variant FF and 8.8 for variant SS.

      "[Comparative study of glutamate dehydrogenases of Chlorella]. The kinetic properties of the constitutive double specific glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)--GDH) and the inducible NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP--GDH) of Chlorella pyrenoidosa Pringsheim 82T (thermophilic strain) in a deaminating reaction have been studied. NAD(P)-GDH behaves in a deamination as a Michaelis-Menten enzyme. NADP-GDH displays some lag-period before a steady-state phase. The duration of this lag depends on a substrate concentration. Besides that, an effect of all the substrates on a heat inactivation of both GDH and a product inhibition have been studied. All the substrates except the reduced co-factors protect effectively GDH from the heat inactivation, especially the thermolabille NADP-GDH. On the contrary, NAD(P)-H promote the heat inactivation of both GDH. The product inhibition analysis shows that the inducible NADP-GDH acts in vivo as a synthetic enzyme. In the previous paper (V. R. Shatilov et all., 1974, Dokl. Acad. Nauk USSR, 216,223) it was shown for the constitutive GDH that p-CMB strongly inhibited a desamination and slightly (if any) affect an amination. It this paper it is shown that action of p-CMB on the amination depends on the presence of NAD+ (not NADP+ or L-glutamate). p-CMB and NAD+ affect tha amination in a strongly sunergetic manner. Some suggestions about the intracellular localization of chlorella GDH are made.\n",
      "[Fibril formation in solutions of solubilized collagen]. Influence of the preparations of bacterial proteinases, protorisine and prototerrisine, was studied on the stability of the mature collagen of beef skin. The chemical composition of the tissue has been shown to be changed by these enzymes inconsiderably. The tissue treated by orisine and terrisine is completely dissolved in 0.5 M acetic acid (solubilized collagen). When the solutions of such collagen are heated to 37 degrees within the pH range from 4 to 10 at the ionic strength of 0.25 fibrils are formed. Under electron microscope fibres are cross-striated that is typical of native collagen fibres with periodicity of about 640 A. After chilling to 4 degrees, a part of fibrils is dissolved again. Nephlometry was used to study the rate of fibril formation as a function of pH and temperature values. A conclusion has been drawn that the mature collagne dissolved after incubation with bacterial proteinases is close to the acid-soluble collagen fraction in the ability to produce fibres upon heating.\n",
      "PAH clearance, sodium excretion, and PAH extraction ratio in acidotic near-term lambs treated with hypertonic sodium bicarbonate. The electrolyte changes and renal hemodynamic adjustment to hypertonic sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) correction of a metabolic acidosis were studied in 4 neonatal lambs and in 2 controls. PAH clearance increased from 0.92 to 1.65 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.05),  urine flow from 0.37 to 0.61 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.05), and Na excretion from 8.4 to 23.7 muEq/min/kg (p less than 0.05) during the NaHCO3 infusion. These increases were transient and returned to pre-infusion levels following NaHCO3 infusion. Calculation of Na intake and output revealed a net retention of 5.1 mEq/kg in the study lambs which was reflected in a rise of serum Na and osmolarity (Osm) during the post-NaHCO3 -infusion period. The extraction ratio of sodium p-aminohippurate (EPAH) and its relationship to arterial pH were studied in 4 additional lambs. The EPAH did not change with metabolic acidosis but for unknown reasons, the infusion of NaHCO3 resulted in a temporary depression of EPAH (p less than 0.001).\n",

This is useful in evaluating the consequences of the artificial kidneys and lungs (pumps and circuitry).

It should be possible to apply such a test to various fields such as the study of rheological properties of platelets, the investigation of certain pathological cases and eventual alterations during storage. The curve obtained reflects a continuous distribution of platelet osmotic fragility.\n",
      "Oxygen transport by haemoglobin. A comparison of whole blood, washed erythrocytes and haemoglobin solution. The properties of haemoglobin oxygen transport were compared under three different conditions: red cell in its natural medium, i.e. plasma (whole blood), washed red cell and haemoglobin A, the former suspended, the latter solved in an iso-osmotic tris buffer. The oxygen haemoglobin affinity (expressed as P50) and the respiratory Bohr effect variations were studied with modified media and unchanged pH and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration. Provided they are refered to intra-erythrocytic pH, none of these values were changed when varying environment. These results suggest that the three major ligands (H+ ions, 2,3-DPG and CO2) interaction with haemoglobin is largely predominant upon other factors which would interfere, and can completely account for oxygen transport by haemoglobin.\n",
      "Kinetics of the disordered chain-to-beta transformation of poly(L-tyrosine) in aqueous solution. The kinetics of the transformation of poly(L-tyrosine) from the disordered chain to the intramolecular beta structure in aqueous solution has been studied. The reaction is induced by an isothermal pH jump and is followed by conventional circular dichroism methods. Upon application of curve-fitting procedures, it is found that the kinetics are poorly represented by a single first-order process, but a two-step sequential first-order equation is adequate. Sharp pH-dependent maxima in the phenomenological rate constants and in the fractional amplitude of the rapid step were found. It is proposed to attribute these phenomena to a transition in initial states which is shown to occur over the same pH range within the domain of the disordered-to-beta transition. No sigmoid transient curves were observed, indicating that no slow nucleation events are discernible in this system. These observations contrast strikingly with the mechanism elaborated for beta formation in (Lys)n [R. Hartman et al., J. Mol. Biol. 90 (1974) 415].\n",
      "Thermodynamic investigations of proteins. I. Standard functions for proteins with lysozyme as an example. A direct method is proposed for obtaining thermodynamic standard functions for native and denatured proteins using experimental data from scanning calorimetry, isothermal calorimetry and potentiometric titrations. The possibility of this approach is demonstrated on the example of lysozyme in the range of pH 1.5-7.0 and temperature 0-100 degrees C. Tests for the validity of the obtained functions of enthalpy and entropy are presented in the form of cyclic processes using experimental data obtained from thermodynamically different pathways. The Gibbs function is checked by comparison with results of an independent method. The methodic problems in determining and checking standard functions for proteins are discussed in detail.\n",
      "Thermodynamic investigations of proteins. III. Thermodynamic description of lysozyme. Standard functions of enthalpy, entropy and the Gibbs energy of native and denatured lysozyme in the range of 0-100 degrees C and pH 1.5-7.0 are represented in three-dimensional projections. The denaturational Gibbs energy change reaches 16 kcal mol-1 at conditions of maximal protein stability (0 degrees C, pH 4.5-7.0) and equals 14.5 kcal mol-1 at 25 degrees C and neutral pH. This result was found to be in agreement with the data reported from guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies. Partial thermodynamic functions of the conformational and ionizational changes of the protein are obtained from entropy and Gibbs-energy changes in denaturation. The conformational partial entropy and Gibbs-energy change are found to be independent of pH. The pH-dependent partial ionizational entropy and Gibbs-energy changes are induced by normalization of the ionization behaviour of buried groups and cause a decrease of protein stability.\n",
      "The self-association of adenosine-5'-triphosphate studied by circular dichroism at low ionic strengths. The self-association of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was studied as a function of pH, additional counterions, concentration and temperature. Circular dichroism measurements were employed as a measure of the base-stacking. The self-association of ATP is pH dependent with the protonation of the adenine ring helping stabilize the association. Highly charged counterions alter this aggregation. At pH 2.8 and 20 degrees C, a dimerization constant of 88 M-1 is obtained, while an isodesmic model leads to an equilibrium constant of 158 M-1. With increasing pH, the association constants decrease. At pH 2.8 there is a very strong temperature dependence of the CD amplitude. These results indicate the existence of additional electrostatic stabilization for the stacking of the adenine rings. At acidic pHs, models are proposed to explain this high degree of stability and a calculation of the approximate electrostatic contribution to the aggregation shows it to be of the proper magnitude.\n",
      "Studies on immobilized trypsin in high concentrations of organic solvents. Trypsin was covalently immobilized on porous glass in the presence and absence of a specific substrate and reacted in various organic solvents of different dielectric constants. Optimum solvent concentration, pH profile, Km(app), Vmax(app), productivity versus temperature, activity, and reaction rates were determined. Reaction rates of six lysyl dipeptides were compared. Crystalline trypsin was dansylated for studies by nanosecond fluorescence techniques to determine the effects of introducing high concentrations of organic solvents on the molecule. The results indicated that greater reaction rates were observed with dipeptides having more acidic carboxyl terminal groups. The data also indicated that greater reaction rates were observed in higher concentrations of solvents of lower dielectric constants. Nanosecond fluorescence spectroscopy of trypsin in high concentrations of a low dielectric constant solvent indicated major dehydration even though maximal enzyme activity was achieved under these conditions.\n",
      "Enzyme immobilization on fibrin. The following conclusions can be drawn concerning the utilization of fibrin to immobilized enzyme systems. Fibrin can be used both as a powder or membrane, to covalently immobilize trypsin with retention of activity. Carbon-14 labeled trypsin can be used to estimate the amount of immobilized enzyme on a proteinaceous support. Significant amounts of noncovalently coupled (adsorbed) enzyme are present on the surface of the support. Esterase activity of the immobilized labeled trypsin was inversely proportional to the amount of attached enzyme. Optimum TAME hydrolysis occurred at pH 8-8.4. The storage stability of trypsin was enhanced. Inhibition of trypsin esterase activity occurred at substrate concentrations greater than 30mM.\n",

      "Assessment in the guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens of benzomorphans which have strong antinociceptive activity but do not substitute for morphine in the dependent monkey. 1 Four benzomorphans which have potent antinociceptive activity in the hot-plate and writhing tests in the mouse but do not suppress or precipitate withdrawal symptoms in the morphine-dependent monkey, have been examined for their pharmacological actions in the guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens. 2 In the guinea-pig ileum their agonist potencies are 1.5 to 400 times greater than that of normorphine of morphine whereas in the mouse vas deferens their potencies relative to morphine are 0.3 to 100. They exhibit no antagonist activity in either preparation. Benzomorphans which substitute for morphine in the morphine-dependent monkey do not show such differences between their relative potencies in the guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas diferens. 3 The relative potencies of the four benzomorphans to inhibit stereospecific [3H]-dihydromorphine binding by membrane fragments from rat brain, are more closely related to their relative agonist potencies in the mouse vas deferens than to those found in the guinea-pig ileum. 4 In order to antagonize the agonist actions of these benzomorphans, naloxone is required in concentrations which are 3 to 7 times higher than those needed for the antagonism of normorphine or morphine or of benzomorphans which suppress abstinence in morphine-dependent monkeys. 5 It may be possible to use the three assays, namely, ratio of relative agonist potency in mouse vas deferens to that in guinea-pig ileum, ratio of relative agonist potency to relative affinity to opiate receptors and the concentration of nalozone required for antagonism, for the prediction of the potential of new compounds to produce physical dependence.\n",

The effects of the alpha- and beta-isomers of flupenthixol on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced platelet aggregation and on 5-HT and dopamine uptake were investigated. Alpha-Flupenthixol was 185 times more potent than the beta-isomer as an inhibitor of platelet  aggregation. In contrast both isomers were equipotent as inhibitors of uptake of 5-HT and dopamine. The data suggest that 5-HT-induced aggregation and uptake are separate processes.\n",
      "Evolution of functional respiratory disorders in different types of pneumoconiosis. Three homogeneous groups of patients with silicosis, coal workers' pneumoconiosis and arc welders' pneumoconiosis had been reexamined after an interval of six years. The same examinations were repeated on each occasion with the purpose of evaluating the evolution of radiographic and functional changes. The clinical course, roentgenographic findings and results of function tests differed in the three groups. In silicosis and coal workers' pneumoconiosis the roentgenographic changes showed distinct progression. This progression was less evident in coal workers' pneumoconiosis, but deterioration of pulmonary function was more pronounced than in silicosis, apparently due to emphysema. In pneumoconiosis of welders roentgenographic changes showed a clear tendency to regression and respiratory function was not impaired.\n",
      "Developmental variations of tyrosine hydroxylase and acetylcholinesterase in embryonic and post-hatching chicken sympathetic ganglia. The developmental variations of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were studied in embryonic and post-hatching chicken sympathetic ganglia. Different levels of TH activity were found in two different flocks of White Leghorn chicken, which are probably dependent on genetic differences. These enzymatic differences, however, do not become apparent before hatching and may indicate a combined effect of genetic variation and functional demands. During the period of incubation, TH activity is characterized by a pronounced and steady increase from the twelfth day of incubation up to day 2 after hatching. This corresponds to a period of intense maturation of the sympathetic neuron. In the period following hatching, the 'fourth day fall phenomenon' previously described by us for DOPA decarboxylase (DDC), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) is not seen in the TH curve. Instead, TH activity tends to remain constant between days 2 and 14 after hatching (ah). Both ganglionic protein and weight remain constant in this period, indicating a phase of general pause in protein synthesis. AChE activity increases steadily from the eighth until the twenty-first day of incubation. A sudden and significant drop in AChE activity was found at day 2 ah followed by a period of rapid increase at day 3 ah and a levelling of activity up to day 30 ah. Comparing the present variations to those observed in our previous studies on DBH, a temporal relationship between TH and DBH activity is observed during the phases of synaptogenesis and maturation but not during the phase of intense functional activity. Our results strongly suggest that before hatching in chick embryo sympathetic ganglia, the cholinergic presynaptic terminals play a role in regulating the development of the adrenergic neurons. In the period following hatching, however, the DBH and TH levels in cell bodies seem to be principally regulated by the functional activity. This results in depletion of DBH, but not TH, through liberation along with the neurotransmitter at the periphery. Depletion of DBH at the terminals may result in increased transport and thereby depletion in the cell body. This mechanism is probably responsible for the difference in the profiles of activity of DBH and TH in the cell bodies observed in the first week after hatching.\n",

      "[Value of the \"gastric chamber\", new technic performed ex vivo, for the study of the gastric mucosa of the rat]. The \"gastric chamber\" technique, performed in the anaesthetised rat, enables the study of gastric mucosal fragility induced by doses of phenylbutazone, which do not themselves cause ulceration or exulceration. The perfusion of buffered solution at pH 2-8 into the gastric chamber shows that prior oral administration of phenylbutazone 50 mg/kg increases the fragility of the mucosa. The optimal delay separating this administration from the time of experimentation is 6 hours. The effects seen are essentially vascular disorders.\n",

The dopamine, dopac and tyrosinehydroxylase contents of the caudate nucleus in the prosimian Perodicticus potto and in the simii Macaca mulatta and M. fascicularis have been estimated. The results do not support the hypothesis according to which the sluggishness of the potto is somehow related to a low dopamine content of part of the extrapyramidal system as found in the Parkinson-syndrome.\n",
      "[The effect of activator on the esterase activity of plasmin obtained by streptokinase]. In the esterasic dosage of plasminogen, the authors aim to determine the optimal ratio between the amount of streptokinase to add and of plasminogen itself.

      "[Oxidative metabolism of funicular tissue. II. Determination of the activity of certain Krebs cycle enzymes]. Previous experiments have suggested that a partial metabolic block might restrain the oxidative metabolism of the cord tissue between the decarboxylation of pyruvate and the oxidation of succinate. Some of the dehydrogenases of the Kreb's cycle were assayed on acetone powders prepared from human cords. Isocitrate dehydrogenases (both NAD and NADP-specific) have much lower activities than the alpha-ketoglutarate- and malate dehydrogenases; a partial block might be located at this level. Moreover, the malic enzyme has a rather high activity, and might play a significant role by regenerating NADPH in a tissue where other sources of this coenzyme are practically absent.\n",
      "[The effect of amino acids on the excitability of identified autoactive giant neurons of Achatina fulica Férussac]. Effects of the following amino acids were examined on the electrical activity of the two giant neurones (PON and TAN) identified in the subesophageal ganglia of Achatina fulica Férussac : L-Asp, L-Thr, L-Ser, L-Glu, L-Pro, Gly, L-alpha-Ala, beta-Ala, L-cysteine, L-cystine, L-Val, L-Met, L-Ileu, L-Leu, L-Tyr, L-Phe, L-Lys, L-His, L-Arg, L-Cit, L-Try, GABA and GABOB. Among these substances, we observed an inhibitory effect of GABA and GABOB on the TAN excitability. GABA showed stronger effect on the TAN than GABOB. This effect of GABA was due to producing hyperpolarization on the TAN membrane. GABA showed a slight excitatory effect on the PON. The effect of GABOB on the PON was very weak and unstable.\n",

Controls with non-toxic extracts of fishes from the coral benthos reinforce the theory of the ecological origins of ciguatoxins.\n",
      "Lorazepam as a premedication. A double-blind random study compared the effects of lorazepam and pantopon an intra-muscular premedication in healthy women for uterine curettage (D &amp; C). Anxiety, as assessed by a self-rating test by the patient and by a trained observer, showed a significant reduction at one and one-half hours after lorazepam and a smaller reduction after pantopon, which was not significant. Sedation was satisfactory with no significant difference between the two drugs in the change before and after the premedication. Lorazepam showed much more amnesia than pantopon (p less than 0.001). The patients who had lorazepam required higher doses of thiopentone for the operation, and this, in part, led to longer intervals in recovery times after lorazepam. However, it is suggested that lorazepam itself was partly responsible for the longer recovery. Pantopon was followed by more nausea, vomiting and headaches, than lorazepam. The intra-muscular injection of lorazepam hurt more patients than did pantopon, but other local complications were negligible and comparable in both groups. The results of this study show that lorazepam produces better reduction of anxiety and much more amnesia than pantopon, with comparable sedation and much less nausea and vomiting. The only disadvantage of lorazepam is the lack of analgesia and, therefore, the need for more anaesthesia during the operation. The conclusion is that lorazepam is a very satisfactory premedication and warrants more use as such.\n",
      "Studies on fazadinium bromide (ah 8165): a new non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. Intravenous dose-response relationships were used to correlate neuromuscular paralysis with the effects of fazadinium (AH 8165) on autonomic mechanisms in anaesthetized cats and rhesus monkeys and with cardiovascular effects in man. In cats and monkeys neuromuscular paralysis of the twitch responses of the gastrocnemius muscle by fazadinium was accompanied by impairment of the vagally induced bradycardia, but cardiovascular disturbances were small. Blockade of sympathetic mechanisms and hypotension were only evident with supra-maximal doses. In man tachycardia was a common occurrence and in some patients hypertension occurred with doses of the drug needed for complete neuromuscular paralysis. Fazadinium was three to four times more potent in rhesus monkeys than in cats and its course of action was considerably longer. The potency of the drug in man corresponded more closely to that in cats than in rhesus monkeys but its course of action in patients was similar to that in monkeys. In man, dose-response curves were constructed for the contractions of the adductor pollicis muscles elicited by tetanic and single twitch stimuli applied to the corresponding ulnar nerves. The onset of paralysis of the tetanic contractions after the intravenous injection of fazadinium (0.4 mg/kg) occurred within two minutes, but recovery was slow and about 50 minutes were needed for its completion. Depression of the simultaneously recorded twitch responses was less marked, slower in onset and recovery was slightly more rapid. These effects were similar to those obtained with tubocurarine (0.2 mg/kg) but the action of fazadinium was slightly shorter. Tetanic-tension ratios were computed after 30 and 50 per cent recovery from neruomuscular blockade in man. These ratios were lower with fazadinium than with tubocurarine and indicated taht tetanic fade was greater and more persistent after fazadinium than after tubocurarine.\n",
      "Biology of large bowel cancer. Present status and research frontiers. Man and laboratory rodents exposed to chemical carcinogens both show changes in growth characteristics of colonic epithelial cells during neoplastic transformation. Progressive phases of abnormal cell development appear in colonic epithelial cells which gain an increased ability to proliferate and accumulate in the mucosa. These phases in the expression of neoplastic transformation of colonic cells are best defined in the dominant inherited disease of man as adenomatosis of the colon and rectum. Individuals with inherited adenomatosis and those in lesser risk categories can be classified by cell phenotype based on changes in the proliferation and maturation of colonic and other cells. These classifications are leading to new predictive indices which identify heightened degrees of susceptibility of individuals who are at increased risk for colon cancer, and the stage of development of their disease. The indices also are being used to study the contribution of specific elements in the enviroment that modify or accelerate the progression of disease.\n",
      "Laboratory aids to diagnosis--enzymes. A summary is presented of those organ specific enzyme assays traditionally used in evaluation of the patient with cancer. In addition, the use of certain serum enzymes such as gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, phosphohexose isomerase or 5'-nucleotidase as aids in following the course of the disease, particularly in patients with metastatic spread to the liver is outlined. Also considered is the utility of enzyme analysis in biopsy tissue, biologic fluids, and washings of body cavities. Newer enzymes are considered which might, in the future, be developed as diagnostic tools or as probes for the understanding of the etiology of cancer.\n",
      "Increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in the liver of mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor. In mice bearing Ehrilich ascites tumors, alkaline phosphatase activity was increased fivefold in the liver and by 50% in the kidney. In mice bearing solid tumors caused by inoculation of tumor cells into the axillary region, the activity of this enzyme in the liver was increased 11-fold, whereas the activity in the kidney did not change. Alkaline phosphatase activities in the liver and kidney were not altered by administration of adrenal steroids. Adrenalectomy, fasting, and pregnancy did not affect the activity of alkaline phosphatase in the liver and kidney. Treatment with tumor extracts or ascites fluid of normal mice increased liver alkaline phosphatase activity. These findings suggested that the elevation of liver alkaline phosphatase activity was cuased primarily by the tumor itself, and not by hormonal imbalance provoked secondarily by the presence of the tumor.\n",
      "Monoamine storage sites in the rat superior cervical ganglion following synthesis inhibition. Monoamine storage sites in paraganglionic (PG-) cells of the rat superior cervical ganglion were investigated by electron and fluorescence microscopy following treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), disulfiram or guanethidine respectively. Dense core vesicles in PG-cells are significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) in number following pCPA, and in the majority of these cells following disulfiram and guanethidine. However in a minor portion of PG-cells the latter agents cause an increase in number and in size of dense core vesicles, in parallel with structural alterations. In agreement with these electron microscopic findings fluorescence microscopic and cytophotometric evaluations reveal a general decrease in catecholamine content with few cells showing an increase. The findings provide a morphological basis for the assumption, that monoamine storage sites in PG-cells can be decreased by inhibition of monoamine synthesis, following administration of pCPA, disulfiram and guanethidine. However the two types of responses of PG-cells which occur after disulfiram and guanethidine demonstrate a functional heterogeneity of this cell system in the rat superior cervical ganglion which is discussed.\n",
      "Ultracytochemistry of the synaptic ribbons in the rat pineal organ. The synaptic complexes of the rat pinealocytes are neither cholinergic nor adrenergic. In the synaptic vesicles, a neurotransmitter carrier substance of lipid nature reacting with OsO4-Zn I2 mixture (similar to that present in both cholinergic and adrenergic vesicles) was not found. In addition, there were no indications of glucose-6-phosphatase or thiamine-pyrophosphatase activity in the synaptic vesicles. Thus, it appears that the synaptic vesicles do not originate from the rough or smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The synaptic ribbons do not contain carbohydrates, are of protein nature and possess some chemical resemblance to microtubules and microtubular bouquets. Appropriate ultracytochemical reactions have not shown detectable quantities of sodium and calcium ions in pinealocyte synaptic complexes.\n",
      "Afferent neural pathway in the regulation of cardiopulmonary responses to tissue hypermetabolism. We studied the role of neural transmission from hypermetabolic peripheral tissues in the regulation of cardiac output and pulmonary ventilation in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Cross-circulation techniques with femoral-femoral or femoral-aortic anastomoses were used to produce a vascularly isolated, but normally innervated, hindlimb or lower half-body, 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) was infused into the arterial side of the perfusion circuit to triple oxygen consumption and to increase lactate production by the cross-perfused area. After infusion of DNP, cardiac output and mean systemic arterial blood pressure increased, but neither heart rate nor pulmonary artery wedge pressure changed significantly. Pulmonary minute ventilation and arterial pH also increased, while arterial PCO2 fell. These changes were abolished when the nerve connections between the perfused limb and its parent body were severed. Normal saline, when administered in a similar manner, did not increase either ventilation or cardiac output, and simple denervation without previous infusions of DNP also had no effect. These results indicate that there are receptors sensitive to metabolic changes in the tissue, and that neural transmission is an important afferent link in regulating the cardiopulmonary responses to increased tissue metabolism.\n",
      "Determination of the molar absorptivity of NADH. The molar absorptivity of NADH at 340 nm has been determined by an indirect procedure in which high-purity glucose is phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of hexokinase, coupled to oxidation of the glucose-6-phosphate by NAD+ in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The average value from 85 independent determinations is 6317 liter mol-1 cm-1 at 25 degrees C and pH 7.8. The overall uncertainty is -4.0 to +5.5 ppt (6292 to 6352 liter mol-1 cm-1), based on a standard error of the mean of 0.48 ppt and an estimate of systematic error of -2.6 to +4.1 ppt. Effects of pH, buffer, and temperature on the molar absorptivity are also reported.\n",
      "Molar absorptivities of beta-NADH and beta-NADPH. Re-investigating the accuracy of the commonly used values for molar absorptivities (epsilon) of beta-NADH and beta-NADPH at Hg 334, Hg 365, or 340 nm, we obtained the following results: The maximum of absorbance of NADH is shifted from about 340 nm at 0 degrees C to about 338.5 nm at 38 degrees C; the corresponding maxima of NADPH are located at about 0.5-nm longer wavelengths. In addition, the absorption curves of both coenzymes broaden with increasing temperature. For these reasons, the epsilon-values of NADH and NADPH are generally different from each other, and are temperature-dependent. Only at 334 nm are they almost identical and nearly independent of temperature. Therefore this wavelength is recommended for precise measurements. The epsilon-values of these coenzymes are influenced by ionic strength and pH. To determine the absolute values of the molar absorptivities, we performed the glutamate dehydrogenase or lactate dehydrogenase assay with carefully purified 2-oxoglutaric acid or pyruvic acid in the presence of excess coenzyme. The purity of the substrates was checked through differential scanning calorimetry, moisture analysis, gas-liquid chromatography, gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The epsilon-values observed under the various conditions are about 1-7% higher than those currently used.\n",
      "Analysis for indole compounds in urine by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. We describe a chromatographic system involving a high-performance chemically-bonded reverse-phase column and fluorescence detection for measurement of indoles in urine. We controlled retention and selectivity by optimizing the methanol content and pH of the mobile phase. Six reference indoles were separated in less than 20 min; three 5-hydroxyindoles were eluted in less than 7 min. About 5-15 ng of aqueous solutions of these compounds can be detected. The combination of selectivity (from use of the chromatographic column) and fluorescence detection permitted analysis for five of the six indoles after a single urine-deproteinization step.\n",
      "Effect of halothane anesthesia on muscle, liver, thyroid, and adrenal-function tests in man. Seven healthy men volunteers received 6.6 +/- 1.3 (SD) percent-hours of halothane oxygen anesthesia without surgery. Serum bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase significantly increased after anesthesia, which may indicate subclinical liver-cell damage. Creatine kinase of skeletal muscle origin increased above 90 U/liter in six subjects, indicating subclinical muscle-cell damage. Cortisol, triiodothyronine uptake, thyroxine, and free thyroxine index increased significantly immediately after anesthesia. Serum bromide concentrations had increased by fivefold on the second day after anesthesia, and on the ninth day was still elevated fourfold. Oral temperatures increased 0.7 degrees C 6 h post-anesthesia, possibly because of increased thyroxine activity. Lactate dehydrogenase, hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities did not change significantly. No drugs administered during the course of this study chemically interfered with any of the test methods used.\n",
      "Improved assay for urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. We describe a simple, rapid, reliable method for determining urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. A neutral resin (Amberlite XAD-2), which is a non-ionic cross-linked polystyrene, is used to extract and concentrate the steroids, which are then quantitatively determined with the Porter-Silber reaction. Use of the resin eliminates the need for enzymatic hydrolysis and n-butanol extractions, thereby decreasing analysis time considerably; results can be obtained within 3 h of receipt of specimens. Most of the nonsteroidal Porter-Silber chromogens are removed, resulting in a method that is highly specific and sensitive, even at low concentrations (0.6 mg/liter), and so more accurate and reproducible than currently used methods.\n",
      "Radioimmunoassay of plasma renin activity. We describe a sensitive, simplified radioimmunoassay method for determination of plasma renin activity. Plasma was acidified to the optimal pH (6.0) of angiotensin l generation with the least possible dilution, by using a single addition of hydrochloric acid and the enzyme inhibitor hydroxyquinoline. Recovery of unlabeled angiotensin l added to plasma was 92-97%; that of monoiodinated angiotensin l exceeded 90%, indicating satisfactory protection from proteolytic enzymes. Plasma constituents interfered little with the radioimmunoassay. Bland values for plasma kept at 0 degrees C were 10.7 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- SD) percent of the activity values for samples kept at +37 degrees C (n equals 63). In the routine setting, 6.25 pg of angiotensin l or 10(-6) Goldblatt units of Standard Human Renin was detected. We report results of plasma renin activity measurements and a comparison with seven renin kits, and with bioassay for plasma renin activity.\n",
      "P-Hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide procedure for serum glucose adapted to the Technicon \"SMA 12/60,\" and compared with other glucose methods. We adapted the p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide procedure for serum glucose for use with the Technicon SMA 12/60 AutoAnalyzer. Like the o-toluidine method, this method is based on a general carbohydrate reaction except that it occurs in a mildly alkaline medium and the intense yellow color formed is measured at 400 nm. Advantages of this reagent over o-toluidine include lower cost, less toxicity, and higher purity. Aside from those carbohydrates that are present in serum in insignificant quantities, there are no interferences from various physiological compounds or drugs (hypoglycemic agents) found either in normal persons or diabetics. Within-run and day-to-day values had coefficients of variation of 1.39% and 3.44%, respectively; recoveries ranged from 100 to 102% (mean, 101%). Comparative data showed excellent agreement with the hexokinase (r equals 0.998; y equals 0.950x + 5.91) and glucose oxidase (r equals 0.996; y equals 0.986x + 5.34) enzymatic (\"true\") glucose methods, and with the o-toluidine procedure (r equals 0.998; y equals 0.979x + 3.14).\n",
      "Lipoamide dehydrogenase in serum: a preliminary report. Lipoamide dehydrogenase was identified in serum and the optimal conditions for its assay at 30 degrees C were defined. The pH optimum in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer is 7.8, and activity is inhibited if buffer concentration exceeds 100 mmol/liter. Saturating concentrations of the substrates NAD+ and lipoamide are 3 mmol/liter and 5 mmol/liter, respectively. Activity is decreased eightfold when lipoic acid is substituted for lipoamide. Activity is linearly related to enzyme concentration up to limiting absorbance change of 0.300 at 340 nm, and both within-day and day-to-day precision are satisfactory. Data suggest a normal range (2 SD) of 3-19 kU/liter. The highest value measured in serum was 473 kU/liter. A correlation with direct bilirubin concentrations (r equals 0.435, P less than 0.01) was found.\n",
      "Direct radioimmunoassay of plasma cortisol. The simplification of the measurement of circulating cortisol by direct radioimmunoassay of plasma samples sets the problem of inhibiting the carrier proteins competing with antibodies. This was accomplished by exploiting the much higher effectiveness of pH and temperature variations on steroid binding to carrier proteins than to antibody sites. A solid-phase system was set up, using antisera to cortisol-21-BSA conjucates coupled to CNBr-activated cellulose. The standardized procedure consisted of an incubation at pH 3.5 and room temperature, directly assaying 10 mul of plasma. A methodological and clinical validation of the measurement was carried out through a series of tests aimed at assessing the reliability of results (assay of steroid-deprived plasma, recovery test and serial dilution of samples, comparison between different antisera and with different methods including extraction, responsiveness to well-established physiological situations). The results obtained are reported and the validity of the method discussed in terms of more general applicability to steroid assay.\n",
      "Methodological simplifications in radioimmunoassay of urinary aldosterone. Simplification of radioimmunoassay procedures of urinary aldosterone-18-glucuronide was attempted, taking into consideration the aspects implied by the hydrolysis of urine and the assay itself. The procedure standardized for the hydrolysis step (samples diluted with a two-fold volume of 0.2 N HCl and incubated at 30 degrees C for 16-24 h) proved suitable in terms of practicability and accuracy. Aldosterone antisera, raised in the rabbit against an aldosterone-3-bovine albumin conjugate, were selected according to their specificity towards competing steroids. Depending on the characteristics of the antisera used, an assay of extracts, or even direct measurements of hydrolyzed urines excluding any extraction, were found to yield reliable results. In the case of a high-quality antiserum, evidence for the adequacy of assay on non-hydrolyzed urine extracts for the measurement of the excretion of unconjugated aldosterone was provided by some preliminary data. The results of the experiments, directed at the methodological and clinical validation of the simplified procedures, are reported and discussed in this paper.\n",
      "[Studies on the activities of peptidases from human leucocytes, and human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages (author's transl)]. Peptidases activities were compared in human leucocytes, guinea pig and human alveolar macrophages. Seversl endo- and exopeptides were characterized; some of them were active at acid pH and others at neutral and alkaline pH. Leucocytes and alveolar macrophages had proteolygic activity for hemoglobin, fibrinogen, collagen and elastin. Using synthetic substrates, several enzymes were characterized: arylamidase, aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidases A and B and cathepsins A and C. The enzymatic activities were much higher in alveolar macrophages than in leucocytes.\n",
      "Experience with a simple method for estrogen receptor assay in breast cancer. A simple procedure for the assay of specific estrogen receptors in breast cancer tissue is described. Estrogen receptors were detected in 74% of primary tumors, 71% of skin metastases and 63% of lymph node metastases. Postmenopausal patients and younger oophorectomized women had estrogen receptor-containing tumors more frequently, and at higher levels, than uncastrated, premenopausal, patients. The stability of estrogen receptors was not affected by the transportation of samples from distant hospitals, providing that they were kept frozen in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, at all times.\n",
      "Immunological detection of isoferritins in normal human serum and tissue. A method is described which permits the detection of isoferritins in normal human serum and tissues. The technique makes use of 125I-labelled monospecific anti-human-liver-ferritin antibody to demonstrate the isoferritins after isoelectric focussing of the purified ferritin in polyacrylamide gels. The organ-specific variation in tissue isoferritin profile previously reported in normal subjects has been confirmed by this technique using only 50 ng of each ferritin sample. Serum ferritin from normal healthy subjects was also shown to exhibit a microheterogeneity on isoelectric focussing; six clearly defined isoferritin peaks were detected in the pH range of 5.04 to 5.62. This isoferritin profile of normal serum contained isoferritins over the whole range of the various tissue isoferritins suggesting that a number of organs may contribute to the normal serum ferritin pool.\n",
      "Acceleration of autoimmunity in NZB/NZW F1 mice by graft-versus-host disease. Chronic graft-versus-host (GVH) disease was induced in NZB/NZW F1 (B/W) hybrid female mice by the weekly injection of parental NZB spleen cells. Control mice received injections of syngeneic spleen cells only. The mice were assayed for antibodies to [3H]DNA and [3H]polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid by a cellulose ester filter radioimmunoassay, and for antibody to thymocytes by a cytotoxicity method. GVH disease accelerated the development of all three antibodies in B/W mice. In addition, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of pooled sera suggested that an accelerated switch from 19S to 7S anti-DNA production may be an early effect of GVH. The mechanism of acceleration is discussed in terms of immunological and viral factors generated by the GVH reaction.\n",
      "Lymphocyte subpopulations. Human red blood cell rosettes. Human red blood cells (HRBC) even without prior neuraminidase treatment, could form rosettes with human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. The optimum conditions for forming these rosettes were a pH of 7-0 and a medium with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Rosette proportions became much less at a different pH or using lower concentrations of BSA, or replacing BSA with foetal calf sera (FCS) or human sera. Rosette formation was also promoted by prior treatment of HRBC or lymphocytes with neuraminidase. Mixed rosettes of HRBC and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) showed that HRBC receptors were detectable only on lymphocytes that possessed SRBC receptors, suggesting that HRBC rosette-forming cells were probably thymus-derived (T) cells. Next, the properties of human red blood cell (HRBC) and sheep red blood cell (SRBC) rosette-forming cells were investigated by comparing the ability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes to form these two types of rosettes after treatment with various inhibitory reagents. HRBC rosettes were relatively more resistant to inhibition with: (1) proteolytic agents, such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase; (2) anti-thymocyte serum (ATS); (3) metabolic inhibitors, such as sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP); (4) cytochalasin B. On further incubation after trypsinization, the lymphocytes recovered some ability to form SRBC rosettes, but continued to lose more of their capability to form HRBC rosettes. All these results were regarded as circumstantial evidence that the HRBC rosettes might represent a subpopulation of human T lymphocytes.\n",
      "Acetate intolerance during hemodialysis. Acetate is frequently substituted for bicarbonate in hemodialysis solutions. Plasma acetate and bicarbonate concentrations were measured in nine patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis with dialyzate containing acetate. In three patients (2 children and 1 adult) plasma acetate concentrations exceeded 15 mEq/liter during the dialysis. The mechanisms leading to acetate intolerance are probably multiple. It cannot be assumed that dialysis with acetate containing solutions will restore the buffer anion deficit characteristic of chronic renal failure.\n",
      "Effect of liver failure on the ventilatory response to hypoxia in man and the goat. 1. The ventilatory responses to transient and steady-state hypoxia were measured in ten patients with hepatic cirrhosis and in ten healthy control subjects. Successive measurements of these responses were also obtained in six goats before and after the experimental production of liver failure. Changes in the effect of steady-state hypoxia on the ventilatory response to hypercapnia were evaluated by successive studies in another goat. 2. In spite of a respiratory alkalosis during liver failure, the response to transient hypoxia was greater in the patients than in the control subjects. This response was increased after the onset of liver failure in all the goats. 3. In healthy humans and goats the responses to transient and steady-state hypoxia were similar in magnitude. During liver failure there was a disparity between the size of these responses, since the ventilatory increment evoked by steady-state hypoxia was unchanged in spite of the increase in response to transient hypoxia. Steady-state hypoxia consistently enhanced the ventilatory response to hypercapnia in a healthy goat, but frequently depressed the response to hypercapnia during liver failure. 4. The findings suggest that liver failure heightens the sensitivity of the peripheral chemoreceptors to the hypoxic stimulus, but may increase the tendency of the medullary centres to become depressed in hypoxia.\n",
      "Ventilatory response to carbon dioxide in tetanus. 1. Ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was measured by the rebreathing technique in seven patients with mild tetanus during the disease state and after clinical recovery. 2. The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was found to be decreased in the tetanus patients during the disease state with normal response after full clinical recovery. It is postulated that the restrictive ventilatory defect was responsible for the decreased ventilatory response to carbon dioxide.\n",
      "[Treatment of severe hypnotic poisoning with extracorporeal haemoperfusion (author's transl)]. Four patients with severe hypnotic intoxication, twice after suicidal intake of barbital, once of barbital, methaqualone and carbromal, and once of carbromal, were treated with six activated charcoal haemoperfusions. Three patients showed rapid improvement in the level of consciousness followed by complete recovery. One female patient died in cerebral coma due to complete acute cerebromalacia following hypoxia. Serious complications due to the haemoperfusion did not occur. Correct use of activated charcoal haemoperfusion enriches the therapeutic spectrum of severe exogenous intoxications.\n",
      "Failure to monoaminergic and cholinergic receptor blockers to prevent prostaglandin E2-induced luteinizing hormone release. Receptor blocking drugs were used to determine whether adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic synapses are involved in mediating the LH release induced by intraventricularly injected PGE2. Prostaglandin E2 (5mug) was injected into the 3rd ventricle (3rd V) of ovariectomized rats, and plasma LH concentrations before and after treatment were determined by radioimmunoassay. Phentolamine, 20 or 30 mug, or pronethalol, 20 mug (alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers, respectively) injected into the 3rd V failed to alter the elevation of plasma LH evoked by PGE2 injected into the ventricle 10 min later. Likewise, LH release following PGE2 was not changed when a dopaminergic blocker, pimozide (0.63 mg/kg, SC), was injected 2 h prior to PGE2. Two antagonists of serotonin, methysergide maleate (3 mg/kg ip) or cinanserin HC1 (1 mg/kg iv) given 2 h or 45 min before PGE2, respectively, failed to alter the action of PGE2. Atropine (100 or 250 mug) injected into the 3rd V 10 min prior to PGE2 was also ineffective in blocking the increase in plasma LH following PGE2. The results of this study indicate that the effect of PGE2 on LH release is not mediated by adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic receptors. They also suggest that PGE2 is not acting trans-synaptically but probably directly on the LHRH neuron to induce the discharge of LHRH into the hypophysial portal vessels which then evokes release of LH from the adenohypophysis.\n",
      "Neurotransmitter regulation of growth hormone and ACTH in the rhesus monkey: effects of biogenic amines. In an attempt to clarify the role of central neurotransmitters in GH and ACTH regulation, chair-adapted unanesthetized adult male rhesus monkeys and chronic indwelling intratrial cannulae were given 30 min infusions of various agonists known to affect central amines, and plasma samples were withdrawn for GH and cortisol determinations. Infusion of acid-saline vehicle alone had no significant effect on plasma GH or cortisol (P less than 0.05). L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa) (4.5 and 45 mg/kg), but not apomorphine (7 mug/kg), a specific dopaminergic agonist, produced significant elevations of GH. Both noradrenergic (clonidine HCl, 1.5, 15, and 150 mug/kg, and D,L-threodihydroxyphenylserine (D,L-threodops) 90 mg/kg) and serotoninergic (5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP), 45 mg/kg) agonists induced significant GH responses. These findings suggest that GH is regulated in the rhesus monkey by noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurons, whereas participation of dopaminergic neurons has not been established. Significant cortisol responses were only observed following infusion of 5HTP (45 mg/kg). Dopaminergic and noradrenergic agonists not only failed to alter resting cortisol levels but also did not affect the cortisol response to 5-HTP. In the rhesus monkey serotoninergic mechanisms appear to be responsible for the regulation of resting cortisol levels. A catecholamine inhibitory mechanism was not demonstrated in this species.\n",
      "Adrenergic binding sites and enzyme activities in the heart of hyperthyroid rats. In present study interactions of some adrenergic drugs with the binding of 3H-norepinephrine (NE) and response of some enzymatic systems in the heart of rats with pharmacological hyperthyroidism have been investigated. Binding of NE to cardiac particles was inhibited by isoproterenol, propranolol and in lower concentrations by another beta-blocking drug trimepranol both in control and hyperthyroid hearts in the same degree. However, after addition of nonradioactive  norepinephrine (10(-3) M) the degree of displacement was lower in hyperthyroid than in euthyroid group. Activity of adenylate cyclase was lower in hyperthyroid cardiac particles. This difference remained preserved after stimulation by norepinephrine or NaF. The activities of hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase were increased in preparation of hyperthyroid hearts. The phosphorylase \"a\" activity was also increased in hyperthyroid cardiac particles. There was no change in cardiac adrenergic binding sites properties in hyperthyroidism with the exception of less displacement of NE by nonlabelled hormone. The results indicate that the increased lipolytic and phosphorylase \"a\" activities in hyperthyroid hearts are not necessarily linked to elevated activity of adenylate cyclase.\n",
      "Determination of total insulin (TIRI) in plasma of insulin-treated diabetics and newborn infants of insulin-treated diabetic mothers. Plasma of insulin-treated diabetics and of newborn infants of insulin-treated diabetic mothers contains insulin antibodies which invalidates the radioimmunoassay of insulin. Therefore, the endogenous insulin antibody complex must be splitted at a pH lower than 5 and the total IRI (TIRI) is separated by ethanol extraction. It was investigated the recovery rate in dependence upon plasma volume used for extraction. By reduction of used plasma volume from 500 to 200 mul per extraction the recovery rate was increased from 65.1 +/- 8.4 to 88.3 +/- 4.2% (mean +/- SEM). The low plasma volume of 200 mul for TIRI extraction made it possible to determine TIRI during glucose loads of newborn infants. To eliminate different conditions of incubation for standard and unknown plasma samples the TIRI levels were computed by means of so-called \"extracted\" standard curve, obtained with extracted insulin from standard insulin dilution in insulin-free pooled human plasma. Using the described method a temporary regeneration of insulin secretion of a newly diagnosed juvenile diabetic after insulin treatment could be shown. In contrast to newborn infants of healthy mothers a biphasic/insulin release was found during the intravenous glucose loads in newborn infants of insulin-treated diabetic mothers.\n",
      "Glutamine synthetase, glutaminase and phosphodiesterase activities in brain under hypoxia: in vitro effect of cortisol, GABA and serotonin on glutamine synthetase. The effect of hypobaric hypoxia on the activities of glutamine synthetase, glutaminase and cyclic 3'5' AMP phosphodiesterase in rat brain was studied after exposure to 25,000' for 6 h. Glutamine synthetase activity was increased in all the regions of brain studied, and addition of gamma amino butyric acid, serotonin and cortisol in vitro produced a differential response. Glutaminase activity decreased in the whole brain. Cyclic 3'5' AMP phosphodiesterase activity decreased in cerebellum, medulla, hypothalamus and pituitary showing an accumulation of cyclic 3'5' AMP in these regions. The results suggest that glutamine synthesis and degradation are regulated in the central nervous system by cyclic AMP and cortisol: Gamma aminoburyric acid and other compounds can modulate the activity of glutamine synthetase and glutaminase.\n",
      "Intermediates in the interconversion of acid and alkaline ferrihemoglobin. Structural and kinetic aspects. The acid-alkaline pH-jump in suspension of crystalline sheep hemoglobin has been studied in the range of 5.95 to 8.94. Crystals suspended in 3.8 M Cs2SO4 show a rapid optical transition of half-time equal to or less than 2 ms. As the ammonia concentration is increased in the Cs2SO4-suspended crystals, a second optical transition is observed as a pseudo-first-order reaction, with a rate constant of between 10 and 15 s-1. The alkaline-acid pH-jump proceeds through a very rapid shift of the alkaline-acid equilibrium and is followed by a first-order dissociation constant between 9 and 12 s-1. The dissociation of the ammonia is biphasic, and the ratio between the fast and slow phases is 9.\n",
      "The reaction kinetics of fluoride and ammonia with acid and alkaline ferrimyoglobin in a crystalline state. Differences between the reactivity of amorphous and crystalline myoglobin have been studied by the rapid-flow method combined with dual-wavelength spectrophotometry. The binding of ammonia to the hydroxide compound has a half-time of 55 ms. The reverse reaction has a half-time of 70 ms. At pH 7.0 the relative half-times of combination and dissociation with fluoride are 10 min for crystalline and 1.8 min for amorphous materials. Reactivity of the crystals to fluoride at pH 6.0 greatly increased as compared with pH 8.7. Half-time at pH 8.7 is 10 min, while at pH 6.0 the half-time is 2.5 s for the crystalline material and 1.4 s for the amorphous material. The exchange of fluoride by azide at pH 6.0 is 3.1-fold faster in amorphous material than in crystalline material.\n",
      "Circular-dichroism and absorption spectroscopic studies on specific aromatic residues involved in the different modes of aggregation of tobacco-mosaic-virus protein. Conformational changes accompanying the different modes of aggregation of tobacco mosaic virus protein (TMV-protein) were investigated using circular dichroism (CD) and absorption difference spectra in the range of aromatic absorption. Comparing wild-type protein and mutant Ni 2068 (Tyr-139 leads to Cys-139) a tentative localization of aromatic amino acids in the three-dimensional structure is rendered possible. In all modes of aggregation the CD spectra are determined by intrasubunit interactions between aromatic residues, in particular Trp-17 and Trp-52 as well as Tyr-70, Tyr-72 and Tyr-139. The Trp-17-Trp-52 interaction was found to be highly sensitive towards changes of the quaternary structure especially with respect to helical aggregates. This suggests that the environment of the two tryptophan residues is of crucial importance in the three-dimensional structure of the subunit; in the course of aggregation intersubunit interactions compete with the specific intrasubunit Trp-17--Trp52 interactions. It is suggested that Try-70 and Tyr-72 form hydrogen bonds in a strongly hydrophobic environment. Formation of the double disc decreases the rotatory strength, pointing to an increase in conformational flexibility. Spectroscopic and chemical evidence prove that Tyr-70, Tyr-72 and Tyr-139 are in close neighbourhood. Double disc formation by lowering the pH (pH 8 LEADS TO 6.9, I = 0.1 M) or increasing the ionic strength (pH 8, I = 0.1 LEADS TO 0.6 M) is reflected by identical spectral effects in the environment of Tyr-70 - Tyr-72. However the interaction between Trp-17 and Trp-52 indicates significant differences in the conformation which may be important for the formation of higher aggregates, i.e. 'lockwashers', helices, and 'stacked discs'.\n",
      "Characterization of the oxygenase activity in a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardi exhibiting altered ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase. A previously described Mendelian mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardi, ac i72, exhibiting altered ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase activity and unable to grow on minimal medium is examined for changes in ribulosebisphosphate oxygenase activity. The ribulosebisphosphate oxygenase activity of the enzyme purified from both wild type and ac i72 is compared over a pH range from 7.0 to 9.5. Both enzymes exhibit maximum activity at pH 9.0. However, the ac i72 enzyme is twice as active as the wild type enzyme at a physiological pH of 7.0. The studies in vivo of the products of CO2 fixation of ac i72 and wild type cells in the presence of high and low O2 concentration shows that due to a lower level of carboxylation, the ac i72 cells fix CO2 at half the rate of wild type cells. In ac i72, 24% of the photosynthetically fixed 14C is channelled into the water-soluble fraction as opposed to 6% in wild type. Thin-layer chromatography of the water-soluble fraction showed extensive accumulation of components of the glycolate pathway in ac i72 as compared to wild type. This indicates that the oxygenase activity of the enzyme prevails in ac i72 in vivo. Since a high concentration of glycolate is toxic to cells of C. reinhardi, the high oxygenase activity of ac i72 provides an explanation for the inability of ac i72 to grow phototrophically even though its rate of CO2 fixation is half that of wild type. This toxicity to glycolate is overcome by growth under amber illumination or low O2 concentration.\n",
      "An intracellular endonuclease of Bacillus subtilis specific for single-stranded DNA. We have fractionated from extracts of Bacillus subtilis the DNase activity specific for single-stranded DNA; the activity separates in two main fractions on Sephadex G-200, a larger one (Mr greater than 400 000) and a smaller one (Mr approximately 30 000). We have purified the smaller, more abundant fraction nearly 3000-fold. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum close to 8, is activated by Ca2+, and is inhibited by EDTA; the enzyme hydrolyses single-stranded DNA at a rate approximately 40 times greater than double-stranded DNA. The mode of action is endonucleolytic on both substrates, but the possiblility that the two activities may reside on different molecules is not ruled out. The products have 5'-P and 3'-OH ends. The enzyme is different from those purified from the culture media of the same organism in several respects; the latter are all extracellular enzymes, they are not specific for single-stranded DNA (except one) and have all an exonucleolytic mode of action.\n",
      "Guanylate cyclase: assay and properties of the particulate and supernatant enzymes in mouse parotid. A new, very sensitive, rapid and reliable assay for guanylate cyclase has been established based on conversion of [32P]GTP to [32P]guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate and its separation on Dowex 50 and aluminium oxide columns. The optimum conditions for the assay of mouse parotid guanylate cyclase have been established and using this procedure the properties of the enzyme have been investigated. The enzyme was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions. The particulate enzyme was activated 12-fold by Triton X-100 and the supernatant enzyme activity increased 2-fold. In the presence of detergent guanylate cyclase activity was distributed 85% in the particulate and 15% in the supernatant fractions, respectively. The particulate activity was localised in a plasma membrane fraction. Guanylate cyclase activity was also assayed in a wide variety of other tissues. In all cases enzymatic activity was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions. The distribution varied with the tissue but only the intestinal mucosa had a greater proportion of total guanylate cyclase activity in the particulate fraction than the parotid. The two enzymes showed some similar properties. Their pH optima were pH 7.4, both enzymes were inhibited by ATP, dATP, dGTP and ITP, required Mn2+ for activity and plots of activity versus Mn2+ concentration were sigmoidal. However, in many properties the enzymes were dissimilar. The ratios of Mn2+ to GTP for optimum activity were 4 and 1.5 for the supernatant and plasma-bound enzymes, respectively. The slope of Hill plots for the supernatant enzyme with varying Mn2+ was 2. The particulate enzyme plots also had a slope of 2 at low Mn2+ concentration but at higher concentrations (above 0.7 mM) the Hill coefficient shifted abruptly to 4. Calcium ions reduced sigmoidicity of the kinetics lowering the Hill coefficient, activated the enzyme at all Mn2+ concentrations but had no effect on the Mn2+:GTP ratio with the supernatant enzyme while with the plasma membrane enzyme Ca2+ had no effect on the sigmoid form of the kinetics at low Mn2+ but prevented the shift to a greater Hill coefficient at higher Mn2+, inhibited the activity at low Mn2+ and shifted the Mn2+:GTP optimum ratio to 4. For the particulate enzyme plots of activity versus GTP concentration were sigmoid (n = 1.3), while the supernatant enzyme exhibited hyperbolic kinetics.\n",
      "Influence of unsaturated fatty acids in chloroplasts. Shift of the pH optimum of electron flow and relations to deltapH, thylakoid internal pH and proton uptake. Linolenic acid (C18:3) is the main endogenous unsaturated fatty acid of thylakoid membrane lipids, and seems in its free form to exert significant effects on the structure and function of photosynthetic membranes. In this investigation the effect of linolenic acid was studied at various pH values on the electron flow rate in isolated spinach chloroplasts and related to deltapH, the proton pump and the pH of the inner thylakoid space (pHi). The deltapH and pHi were estimated from the extent of the fluorescence quenching of 9-aminoacridine. Linolenic acid caused a shift (approximately one unit) of the pH optimum for electron flow toward acidity in the following systems: (a) photosystems II + I (from H2O to NADP+ or to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol) coupled or non-coupled; (b) photosystem II (from H2O to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol in the presence of dibromothymoquinone). In photosystem I conditions (phenazine methosulphate), the deltapH of the control increased as a function of external pHo with a maximum around pH 8.8. When linolenic acid was added, the deltapH dropped, but its optimum was shifted toward more acidic pHo. The same phenomena were also observed in photosytems II + I (from H2O to ferricyanide) and in photosystem II conditions (from H2O to ferricyanide in the presence of dibromothymoquinone). However, the deltapH was smaller and the sensitivity of the proton gradient toward linolenic acid was eventually higher than for photosystem I electron flow activity. The proton pump which might be considered as a measure of the internal buffering capacity of thylakoids was optimum at pHo, 6.7 in the controls. An addition of linolenic acid diminished the proton pump and shifted its optimum toward higher pHo. As a consequence, pHi increased when pHo was raised. At the optimal pHo 8.6 to 9, pHi were 5 to 5.5. Additions of increasing concentrations of linolenic acid displaced the curves toward higher pHi. A decrease of pHo was therefore required to maintain the pHi in the range of 5-5.5 for maximum electron flow. In conclusion, the electron flow activity seems to be delicately controlled by the proton pump (buffer capacity), deltapH, pHi and pHo. Fatty acids damage the membrane integrity in such a way that the subtile equilibrium between the factors is disturbed.\n",
      "Uronic acid dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas syringae. Purification and properties. 1. Uronic acid dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity. After a 338-fold purification a yield of 16% was achieved with a specific activity of 81 mumol NADH formed min-1 mg protein-1. 2. The purity of the enzyme was controlled by disc electrophoresis, sodium dodecylsulfate electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. 3. A molecular weight of 60 000 was determined by gel chromatography and by ultracentrifugation. 4. The native enzyme is composed of two subunits, their molecular weight being 30 000 as estimated by sodium dodecylsulfate electrophoresis. The subunits as such are inactive. 5. The absorption spectrum with a maximum at 278 nm shows no evidence for a prosthetic group. 6. For catalytic activity no SH groups and no metals seem to be necessary. 7. The Michaelis constants determined with the pure enzyme are for glucuronic acid Km = 0.37 mM, galacturonic acid Km = 54 muM and NAD+ (with glucuronic acid) Km = 80 muM. 8. A weak reverse reaction could be observed with glucaric acid lactones at acidic pH. 9. NADH is competitive with NAD+. The inhibitor constant is Ki = 60 muM. 10. The NAD+ binding site seems to be of lower specificity than the uronic acid binding site.\n",
      "The purification and properties of the trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase mediated by the R-factor, R388. The R-factor R388 mediates the production of a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme has a different molecular weight and pH profile to the trimethoprim-sensitive enzyme of the Escherichia coli host. The R-factor mediated enzyme was separated completely from the host E. coli enzyme by DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography. The purified R-factor enzyme was about 20 000 times less susceptible to trimethoprim than the E. coli enzyme and although it was inhibited competitively by trimethoprim, its inhibitor constant (Ki) was 20 000 times greater than that of the host enzyme. The R388 and E. coli enzymes also differed in their substrate specificity requirements. In addition, the R388 enzyme suprisingly conferred high level resistance to the broad spectrum dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, amethopterin. The possible origins of the R388 enzyme are discussed.\n",
      "Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis in arterial wall. Hexosaminyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase in cell membranes of aortic media-intima. Hexosaminyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase are well known for their role in the biosynthesis of proteoglycans. These two enzymes are characterized in rough and smooth membranes, obtained following subcellular fractionation of aortic media-intima. They require the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+ for activity. The optimum concentration for these two cations is 5 mM. The optimum pH for hexosaminyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase is approximately 6.8 in Tris buffer, and their optimum temperature is 30 degrees C. Hexosaminyltransferase has an apparent Km of 0.27 nM. Glucuronyltransferase has an apparent Km of 0.21 nM. Uptake of labeled sugars by endogenous proteoglycans is inhibited by puromycin. Hexosaminyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase are present in both rough and smooth submicrosomal fractions. The different endogenous glycosaminoglycans are labeled during our incubation experiments. The greatest incorporation is noted for hyaluronic acid and heparan sulfate; the least is seen for chondroitin sulfate. The results obtained in vitro for incorporation of labeled precursors into endogenous proteoglycans are consistent with those observed during the study in vivo of the turnover of these macromolecules.\n",
      "A study of the lysyl residues in the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance at 360 Mhz. Fourier transform 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments at 360 MHz using convolution difference techniques to improve the spectral resolution were employed to investigate the resonances of the lysyl residues in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The observations in both native protein and in chemically modified protein containing Nepsilon-dimethyllsysine show that three of the four lysines extend predominantly freely into the solvent, whereas lysine-41 is involved in an intramolecular interaction with tyrosine-10. Since in the single crystal structure tyrosine-10 is involved in an intermolecular interaction with arginine-42 of the neighboring protein molecule, the NMR data thus reveal a local conformation difference for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor in solution and in the crystalline form which appears to result primarily from intermolecular interaction in the crystal lattice.\n",
      "Effect of triiodothyronine on rat liver chromatin protein kinase. 1. Injection of triiodothyronine to rats stimulates protein kinase activity in liver chromatin nonhistone proteins. A significant increase was found after two daily injections. A 4-fold increase was observed with the purified enzyme after eight daily injections of the hormone. No variations were observed in cytosol protein kinase activity. Electrophoretic pattern, effect of heat denaturation, effect of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate seem to indicate that the enzyme present in treated rats is not identical to the enzyme in control animals, which suggests that thyroid hormone has induced nuclear protein kinase. Diiodothyronine, 3, 3', 5'-triiodothyronine have no effect on protein kinase. 2. Chromatin non-histone proteins isolated from rats injected with triiodothyronine incorporated more 32P when incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP than the chromatin proteins from untreated rats. Thyroidectomy reduced the in vitro 32P incorporation. It is suggested that some of the biological activity of thyroid hormone could be mediated through its effect on chromatin non-histone proteins.\n",
      "Subcellular distribution of histone-degrading enzyme activities from rat liver. Chromatin prepared from liver tissue contains a histone-degrading enzyme activity with a pH optimum of 7.5-8.0, whereas chromatin isolated from purified nuclei is devoid of it. The histone-degrading enzyme activity was assayed with radioactively labelled total histones from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Among the different subcellular fractions assayed, only lysosomes and mitochondria exhibited histone-degrading enzymes. A pH optimum around 4.0-5.0 was found for the lysosomal fraction, whereas 7.5-8.0 has been found for mitochondria. Binding studies of frozen and thawed lysosomes or mitochondria to proteinase-free chromatin demonstrate that the proteinase associated with chromatin isolated from frozen tissue originates from damaged mitochondria. The protein degradation patterns obtained after acrylamide gel electrophoresis are similar for the chromatin-associated and the mitochondrial proteinase and different from that obtained after incubation with lysosomes. The chromatin-associated proteinase as well as the mitochondrial proteinase are strongly inhibited by 1.0 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Weak inhibition is found for lysosomal proteinases at pH 5. Kallikrein-trypsin inhibitor, however, inhibits lysosomal proteinase activity and has no effect on either chromatin-associated or mitochondrial proteinases. The higher template activity of chromatin isolated from a total homogenate compared to chromatin prepared from nuclei may be due to the presence of this histone-degrading enzyme activity.\n",
      "Anion and amine uptake and uncoupling in submitochondrial particles. 1. Unlike chloroplasts, submitochondrial particles are not uncoupled by nigericin + KCl or NH4Cl. Also the uncoupling effect of lipophilic anions is largely independent of the addition of weak bases. 2. Low concentrations of permeant anions cause a shift of the steady-state energy level rather than a cycle of energy utilization. The degree of inhibition of ATP synthesis by tetraphenylboron is larger than required for the uptake of the anion. 3. Lipophilic anions such as bromthymolblue, bromcresolpurple, and 8-anilino-1-napthalene sulphonate cause a pH-independent, 50% uncoupling in submitochondrial particles at concentrations of 3, 30 and 30 muM, respectively. The passive interaction of bromthymolblue and bromcresolpurple appears as a pH-dependent distribution between two pHases. ATP causes a pH-independent slight shift in the anion distribution, with negligible anion accumulation. 4. Addition of amines to energized submitochondrial particles results in two types of effects; uptake of amines and uncoupling. While in chloroplasts amine uptake and uncoupling are closely associated, this is not the case in submitochondrial particles. The uncoupling effect is observed only with lipophilic and not with hydrophilic amines, and the degree of uncoupling increases with the lipophilicity of the amines. The amine uptake, on the other hand, is accompanied by negligible uncoupling. 5. While the uptake of amines is dependent on the presence of non-permeant anions, such as Cl-, the uncoupling effect is independent of Cl-. Furthermore the amine uncoupling is markedly enhanced by lipophilic anions. 6. The view is discussed that the uncoupling effect of lipophilic anions and lipophilic amines in submitochondrial particles is due to a catalytic energy dissipation rather than to a stoichiometry energy utilization. The molecular mechanism of uncoupling presumably involves a cycling of charges after a perturbation of the membrane structure.\n",
      "Oral antipyretic therapy: evaluation of benorylate, an ester of acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol. The capacity of benorylate, an ester of acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol, to reduce fever in children was compared with that of the components as such or as a combination. The series of cases studied consisted of 66 patients between the ages of 4 months and 12 years with rectal temperatures above 38.5 degrees C. Temperatures were recorded at 15 and 20 min and 1, 2, 4 and 6 hrs after the administration of the drug. The antipyretic effect of combined acetylsalicylic acid (11 mg/kg) and paracetamol (14 mg/kg) was superior to the effect of benorylate with a dose of 25 mg/kg and even of 50 mg/kg as well as better than the effect of either drug alone. Acetylsalicylic acid (10 mg/kg) and paracetamol (12.5 mg/kg) alone produced a significantly greater antipyretic effect than benorylate with a dose of 25 mg/kg. Given in a dose of 35--40 mg/kg, benorylate seems to have a significant antipyretic effect. However, this effect is clearly smaller than that of either of its components, acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol. Therefore benorylate is probably not suitable to be used as a general antipyretic agent in children.\n",
      "Effect of ischemic anoxia on electrical and mechanical activity of the totally isolated porcine stomach. Electrical and mechanical activity were recorded from totally isolated whole porcine stomachs perfused with homologous blood. Stagnant, complete ischemia was then produced by closing the gastric artery and vein for various periods of time up to 3 h. After a given period of ischemia, blood was recirculated for 10 min and then pentagastrin was injected into the gastric artery. The vagus nerve was also electrically stimulated at various stages of anoxia and recirculation. After up to 90 min of ischemia, stomachs were able to demonstrate electrical control activity of low frequency after 10 min of blood recirculation. After injection of pentagastrin, electrical control activity rapidly became normal. When ischemia lasted 120 min or longer, recirculation of blood did not induce reappearance of electrical control activity, but pentagastrin injection produced a normal response. After ischemia of 240 min duration or longer, recirculation and pentagastrin had no effect. In previously ischemic stomachs the response to vagal stimulation occurred only in the stomachs responding to pentagastrin.\n",
      "Combined azaperone and metomidate anaesthesia in liver transplantation in the pig. Combined azaperone and metomidate anaesthesia has been used in 86 surgical procedures on 84 piglets, either as such or deepened and prolonged. 51 animals were sacrificed at the end of the procedure as planned before. The anesthesia allowed the performance of various short and long operations. Out of the 33 remaining pigs, submitted to 35 operations, 4 died during the procedure of a technical fault; 2 did not recover from a deep hypothermia (below 10 degrees C); 1 died from the hepatic coma induced through the operative procedure.

      "Cardiovascular and beta-adrenergic blocking effects of timolol. The haemodynamic effects of timolol and its inhibiting action on the cardiovascular and bronchial effects of isoproterenol have been studied. Splanchnic nerve activity was recorded. The antiarrhythmic action of timolol was studied on guinea pig isolated atria, using arrhythmias induced by epinephrine, ouabain or coronary ligation in the dog. Timolol is a very potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, without specificity on beta1- or beta2-receptors. No intrinsic beta-stimulating or depressant effects were found. Timolol reduced splanchnic discharges. The antiarrhythmic effect of timolol was limited to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias.\n",
      "Effects on rectal temperature in rats of gamma-aminobutyric acid; possible mediation through putative transmitters. The rectal temperature of male rats was measured in a thermoneutral environment (25 degrees C) and at ambient temperatures of 15 and 35 degrees C. Unless otherwise specified all drugs were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) and all results are reported for the thermoneutral environment. Exposure to 15 degrees C did not affect the rectal temperature but exposure to 35 degrees C produced hyperthermia. At 15 and 25 degrees C, 20 mug GABA produced hyperthermia which was longer lasting at the former ambient temperature. GABA (20 mug) prevented the hyperthermic effect of exposure to 35 degrees C and produced hypothermia in animals maintained at this temperature for 1 hr. A low dose (1 mug) of NA produced hyperthermia and a higher dose (mug) hypothermia. In rats pretreated with sodium salicylate (i.p.), 20 mug GABA and 1 mug NA produced hypothermia instead of hyperthermia, suggesting the release of PGE in mediating hyperthermia. The hypothermic effect of 10 mug NA and of GABA observed at 35 degrees C was blocked by phentolamine, an indication of the possibility of alpha-adrenoceptor mediation.\n",
      "Analysis of cardiac chronotropic responses to diazepam and bromazepam in conscious trained dogs. In conscious trained dogs, administration of bromazepam (0.3 mg/kg p.o.) or diazepam (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg p.o.) had no influence on heart rate. A higher dose (10 mg/kg p.o.) of two benzodiazepines elicited a positive chronotropic effect which was rapid in onset and of long duration. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent practolol (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) did not revert heart rate after the benzodiazepines to the same level as in controls, indicating that the tachycardia was not produced by an increase in sympathetic outflow to the heart. For diazepam, a sympathetic--parasympathetic interaction cannot be excluded. However, diazepam and bromazepam significantly reduced the tachycardia which is normally observed after administration of methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) alone or in combination with practolol. In anaesthetized dogs, bromazepam failed to modify the heart rate responses to electrical stimulation of cardiac vagal or sympathetic nerves, excluding an action on this compound on ganglionic transmission and cardiac cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors. It is concluded that high doses of diazepam and bromazepam influence the heart rate of conscious dogs in a biphasic way. Firstly, they cause a central reduction of vagal tone to the heart resulting in tachycardia. Secondly, the two drugs decrease the cardiac pacemaker rate directly. Since the overall effect is tachycardia, the central action is more pronounced.\n",

By employing spectrofluorometry and quantitative fluorescent histochemistry the norepinephrine (NE) content in the tissue and in the adrenergic nerves of Vas deferens of the rat after depletion of the transmitter's reserves with tyramine and their subsequent replenishment through incubation of the tissue with exogenous NE was measured. The object of investigations was also the influence of antidepressants (phthoracizine and imipramine) and of the cholinolytic spasmolytin (diphacyl) on processes of the NE accumulation. Phthoracizine, impramine and spasmolytin were found to capable of inhibiting accumulation of the exogenous NE in the tissue and in the adrenergic nerves of Vas deferens, provided the mediator is present in the extraneuronal medium in a concentration of 0.5 gamma/ml. When the neurotransmitter was introduced into the medium in higher concentrations (10 gamma/ml) the antidepressents and cholinolytic did not produce the said effect. A correlation of spectrofluorometric and quantitative fluorescent-histochemical findings was observed in cases when the tissue contained less than 50% (i.e. less than 9 gamma/ml) of the total NE reserves.\n",
      "[Possible participation of potassium ions in the regulation of local cerebral blood flow]. The microinjections of mock spinal fluid with various potassium concentrations into the cat and monkey brain tissue were made in acute and chronic experiments. The vascular reactions as studied with the microphotography and H-clearance method were found to be linearly related to the potassium concentrations within the range of 0--12 mEq/1, being constrictory below 5 mEq/1 and dilatory above that. An interaction between MSF potassium and pH seems to be weak if any, since the slope of the potassium vascular activity diagram remains unchanged within 6.8--7.8 pH change. The data obtained suggest that potassium ions take part in rCBF control since potassium is known to escape from stimulated nerve cells and thus substantially increase an extracellular potassium concentration.\n",
      "The alternate complement pathway in inflammatory bowel disease. Quantitation of the C3 proactivator (factor B) protein. A component of the complement system's alternate pathway was investigated in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The mean C3PA (Factor B) titer in normals was 74 +/- 15%; in ulcerative colitis, 92 +/- 18%; and in Crohn's disease, 119+/- 24%. Significance was at the P less than 0.001 level when the mean values for the ulcerative colitis and the Crohn's disease groups were compared to normal subjects. Titers did not change significantly with exacerbation or amelioration of the diseases or when patient groups were analyzed according to the mode of treatment received.\n",
      "Measurement of gastric functions during digestion of ordinary solid meals in man. A method of measuring gastric secretions and emptying rates after ingestion of an ordinary (solid-liquid) meal has been developed and validated. The technique quantifies movements of volume across the pylorus using constant duodenal perfusion with a nonabsorbable marker, polyethylene glycol (PEG), which, in turn, quantifies emptying into the duodenum of another marker, [14C]PEG, incorporated in the meal. Acid and pepsin outputs can be determined without manipulation of the intragastric pH. Employing this method, we have simultaneously quantified acid, pepsin, and total secretory outputs; rates of gastric emptying of meal and secretions; and serum gastrin levels during digestion. These data characterize physiological responses to ordinary food in health.\n",
      "A dopamine receptor in esophageal smooth muscle of the opossum. We examined the possibility that dopamine may play a role in nerve-mediated \"off\" responses of esophageal body (EB) and relaxations of lower esophageal spincter (LES) smooth muscle. The effects of dopamine, epinine, and dopamine antagonists on EB and LES smooth muscle were studied on these responses. Dopamine and epinine caused a dose-related fall in basal LES muscle tension and in amplitude of EB muscle \"off\" responses. Threshold dose for both was about 10(-7) M, and maximal dose was about 10(-4) M. At high concentrations, they also caused repetitive transient contractions of both LES and EB muscle after the period of inhibition. These effects were antagonized by haloperidol, 10(-5) M, and bulbocapnine, 10(-5) M, but were not influenced by propranolol, 10(-5) M, nor by phenoxybenzamine, 10(-5) M. Neither haloperidol nor bulbocapnine influenced responses to electrical field stimulation. Tetrodotoxin 10(-7) M abolished the responses to electrical field stimulation but did not antagonize the effects of dopamine and epinine. EB and LES smooth muscle contain a dopamine receptor. It is unlikely that dopamine is involved in responses to electrical field stimulation.\n",
      "[Continuous subcutaneous pH monitoring in newborns with abnormal metabolism (author's transl)]. In newborns with postpartum acidosis the subcutaneous interstitiel space pH was monitored continuously with the special electrode of Stamm and Moeller. This was compared with intermittent determinations of the pH in the capillary blood from the heel of the infant. The severity of the metabolic disturbance can be recognized in all test cases with both methods. The correction of the acidosis develops in a concordant manner, in a concordant magnitude and at a largely synchronous rate. The observations show that it is possible to monitor the postpartum adaptation phase by continuous pH monitoring in the interstitial space of the subcutaneous tissue and to observe the efficiency of the treatment of acidosis, administration of oxygen, or a buffer infusion.\n",
      "[The significance of gestational age in evaluating the antepartal cardiotokogram (author's transl)]. The influence of gestational age on the probable meaning of features in the antepartal CTG which are not clearly pathological was investigated in 232 births in 1973/74. The umbilical artery pH was significantly lower among premature infants exhibiting abnormal, than among those exhibiting normal CTG patterns. No similar difference was found in term or overdue births. The clinical diagnosis of neonatal condition using the Apgar scheme confirmed biochemical findings: The frequency of depressed babies is in turn clearly higher in cases with abnormal antepartal CTG patterns. It is assumed that the reason for this is the higher sensitivity of premature babies to haemodynamic disturbances. Thus, it follows that premature babies exhibiting antepartal patterns which are not completely normal require close observation.\n",
      "Characteristics of lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella typhi isolated from carriers and patients suffering from typhoid fever. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Salmonella typhi strains, isolated from carriers and patients suffering from typhoid fever, were characterised according to their biochemical properties, morphological structure and degree of aggregation of complexes. All preparations of LPS, regardless of their origin, were morphologically heterogeneous. Free electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated that LPS preparations were composed of components possessing different mobilities in electric fields. LPS of bacterial strains isolated from both carriers and patients, split upon reaction in immunoelectrophoresis with specific antiserum 73, rabbit antiserum to Salmonella typhi Vi Bhatnagar and 0-901 split into anodic and cathodic fractions. The anodic fraction reacted similarly as Vi antigen. LPS from Salmonella typhi Ty-2 yielded only the cathodic fraction, typical for O antigen. LPS from strains which were passaged twice in nutritional medium possessed identical properties as LPS from fresh cultures of Salmonella typhi. Electron microscopy revealed that LPS appears as long bands, rods, ellipsoid forms and amorphous material. Contrary to amorphous material, the bands, rods and ellipsoid forms possessed three-layer structure.\n",
      "Reduction of blood platelet monoamine oxidase activity in schizophrenic patients on phenothiazines. A newly developed assay for monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in blood platelets (serotonin used as substrate) was applied for the measurement of the enzyme activity in 76 schizophrenic patients. No significant reduction was found in the blood platelet MAO activity in a group of 33 untreated schizophrenic patients, as compared to that in the normal controls. Male patients revealed to have lower enzyme activity than females in the schizophrenic group, as we described previously in the normal subjects. Treatment with phenothiazines caused significant reduction of blood platelet MAO activity, while platelet serotonin content and platelet count appeared to be not affected by the drug treatment. The authors suggest that blood platelet MAO activity may be related to hormonal factors but not to psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia or constitution liable to schizophrenic illnesses.\n",
      "[Inflammatory cerebro-vascular disease: angiographic findings and distribution patterns (author's transl)]. Although cerebral angiography should be approached with caution in the diagnosis of inflammatory cerebro-vascular disease there are some characteristic angiographic findings which may be helpful for classification and differential diagnosis. The proximal cerebral arteries are favourably affected by basal meningitis and thrombangiitis obliterans with resulting stenoses and occlusions. Whereas those inflammations originating from neighbouring skull structures mostly involve the intracavernous parts of the carotid artery, the tuberculous and mycotic arteritis prefer the supraclinoid carotid siphon. Peripheral vascular changes are found in luetic endangiitis, necrotizing and toxic angiitis and in collagenoses. Simultaneous involvement of the temporal arteries is of great diagnostic importance demonstrating the systemic character of the inflammatory process; in Horton's arteritis it can be a pathognomonic finding. Infectious endocarditis, some mycoses and malaria may lead to embolic occlusion of cerebral vessels. Mycotic aneurysms mostly have a broad base or a fusiform shape and do not prefer the localizations of congenital aneurysms. Angiographically, abscesses, tuberculomas and viral encephalitis may result in circumscribed hypervascularized areas. The characteristic angiographic findings are exemplified and discussed on the basis of 8 cases of inflammatory cerebro-vascular disease (tuberculosis, pneumococcal and unspecific bacterial meningitis, syphilis, mycosis, Takayasu-syndrome, panarteritis nodosa, temporal arteritis).\n",
      "Oxidative deamination of biogenic amines by intestinal amine oxidases: histamine is specifically inactivated by diamine oxidase. The ability of the gut to inactivate various amines by oxidative deamination was tested with a 130-fold purified amine oxidase preparation from dog small intestine. Of 34 amines tested, putrescine, benzylamine, cadaverine, and serotonin were the most favourable substrates. Histamine was inactivated rapidly by this enzyme preparation, too. Histamine derivatives methylated at the imidazole nucleus were also deaminated, whereas Nalpha-methylhistamine was only a poor substrate and Nalpha, Nalpha-dimethylhistamine was not a substrate at all. Using a second procedure for the purification of amine oxidases from gut, the separation of a soluble monoamine oxidase from diamine oxidase was achieved by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The diamine oxidase deaminated putrescine (Km = 1.3 x 10(-4)M) and histamine (Km = 6.6 x 10(-5)M), but not serotonin, and was inhibited by aminoguanidine, but not by pargyline. The soluble monoamine oxidase inactivated serotonin (Km = 4.5 x 10(-4)M), but not histamine and putrescine and was inhibited by pargyline, but not by aminoguanidine. It was concluded that in dog small intestine (as well as in rabbit small intestine) only diamine oxidase was capable of inactivating histamine by oxidative deamination.\n",
      "Comparative toxicology in vitreous humor and blood. Drug and toxic substances were detected in blood and vitreous humor in fifty-six cases, in which causes of death were both from an overdose of the particular substances and from other unrelated causes. Five instances are reported in which two drug substances were detected in blood and vitreous humor from the same subject. Patients having long survival times, as well as those dying from unrelated causes, reveal drug values to approach unity, when the blood and vitreous concentrations are compared. The ratios reached at equilibrium probably depend on solubility of the drug in vitreous humor, lipid solubility and the percentage protein-bound in the blood. The vitreous humor provides another parameter of testing and may be useful in studies of survival time.\n",
      "Electrodecantation of serum proteins. The sedimentation of albumin under the action of the electric and gravitational fields was determined as a function of time in discontinuous experiments in a rectangular cell, using serum with the albumin fraction stained blue. It was shown that even under the influence of strong electric fields, the upper boundary of the albumin layer fell no further than the mid-point of the cell. In continuous single-stage separation of gamma-globulin from other serum proteins, only about half the gamma-globulins can be obtained from the solution because it remains homogeneously distributed throughout the solution and is only free from albumin and other proteins in the upper half of the cell. In experiments with continuously operated triangular cells, the process was optimized to give gamma-globulin of 97.5% purity in a yield of 80%, at serum flow-through rates of up to 0.5 l/h in a block composed of 40 cells.\n",
      "Recent studies on cytochrome P-450-linked functions in isolated rat liver cells. In rat liver cells isolated by perfusion in the perfusion in the presence of collagenase, the major portion of cytochrome P-450 is present in the oxidized, nonsubstrate-bound, low spin state. Drug addition to a suspension of liver cells results in the rapid formation of the cytochrome P-450 (Fe3+)-substrate complex which in turn is followed by the appearance of other species with different spectral characteristics before steady state drug monooxygenation is achieved. Cytochrome P-450-linked metabolism of various tested drugs and carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons by isolated rat liver cells is as fast, or faster, as with rat liver microsomes supplemented with a NADPH generating system. Both experimental models respond similarily to phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene pretreatment of the animals and to various of the wellknown inhibitors of drug metabolism. Except with liver cells isolated from fasted, phenobarbital-treated rats, generation of cytosolic NADPH seems sufficient to support optimal drug metabolism even in the absence of added substrates of intermediary metabolism. In isolated liver cells oxidized drug metabolites undergo subsequent metabolic conversion, most often to form the corresponding glucuronides and sulphates. These are readily excreted, whereas non-conjugated products, e.g. free phenols, tend to accumulate intracellularly. Cellular glucuronide formation is strongly inhibited by ethanol-presumably due to an unfavorable effect of the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio on the synthesis of uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA). In contrast, low concentrations of ethanol have no, or only a slight stimulatory effect on the cytochrome P-450-linked step of drug metabolism and there are indications that the oxidation of low concentrations of ethanol is in fact stimulated by a facilitated reoxidation of cytosolic NADH occuring during drug monooxygenation.\n",
      "D-glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium M 1286: purification, properties and structure. 1) Glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium has been purified to a specific activity of 550 U per mg protein. The homogeneity of the purified enzyme was demonstrated by gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. 2) The amino acid composition has been determined. 3) The molecular weight of the native enzyme was found to be 116000 by gel permeation chromatography, in good agreement with the values of 120000 and 118000, which were ascertained electrophoretically according to the method of Hedrick and Smith and by density gradient centrifugation, respectively. 4) In the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate and 8M urea, the enzyme dissociates into subunits with a molecular weight of 30000 as determined by dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis. These values indicate that the native enzyme is composed of four polypeptide chains, each probably possessing one coenzyme binding site, which can be concluded from fluorescent titration of the NADH binding sites. 5) In polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis, samples of the purified enzyme exhibit three bands of activity, which present the native (tetrameric) form of glucose dehydrogenase and two monomeric forms (molecular weight 30000), arising under the conditions of pH and ionic strength of this method. 6) The enzyme shows a sharp pH optimum at pH 8.0 in Tris/HCl buffer, and a shift of the pH optimum to pH 9.0 in acetate/borate buffer. The limiting Michaelis constant at pH 9.0 for NAD is 4.5 mM and 47.5 mM for glucose. The dissociation constant for NAD is 0.69 mM. 7) D-Glucose dehydrogenase is highly specific for beta-D-glucose and is capable of using either NAD or NADP. The enzyme is insensitive to sulfhydryl group inhibitors, heavy metal ions and chelating agents.\n",
      "[Enzyme induction in Streptomyces hydrogenans. V. Characterization of testosterone-17 beta-dehydrogenase and its induction by steroids]. Testosterone 17beta-dehydrogenase can be enriched from Streptomyces hydrogenans. The enzyme dehydrogenizes testosterone with Km=13muM and estradiol-17beta with Km=21muM to the corresponding 17-ketoderivatives. NAD forms NADH with Km=125muM. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by androstandione and 17alpha-methyltestosterone. The Ki for 17alpha-methyltestosterone is 18muM. The enzyme activity increases with increasing pH up to alkali-mediated denaturation at about pH 10. The optimum temperature is at 45 degrees C. If Streptomyces hydrogenans is cultivated in the absence of steroids, the specific activity of testosterone 17beta-dehydrogenase in the cytosol of the microorganisms amounts to 10 mU/mg protein, and increases up to 10-fold if the cells are cultivated in the presence of certain steroids. Testosterone, alpha-dihydrotestosterone, beta-dihydrotestosterone, estradiol-17beta, and 17alpha-methyltestosterone are very effective inducers. Thus, for the first time, the ability of estradiol-17beta to induce an enzyme synthesis in a microorganism is shown. The steroid-dependent induction is inhibited by testosterone acetate and rifamycin SV. Cyproterone, however, does not decrease the testosterone-dependent enzyme induction of testosterone 17beta-dehydrogenase.\n",
      "Boar acrosin, II: Amino acid composition, amino terminal residue and molecular weight estimations by ultracentrifugation. The molecular weight of boar acrosin in neutral solution was estimated to be 41000 +/- 1000 by high-speed sedimentation equilibrium analysis. This result is in good agreement with the value found earlier[1] by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sedimentation coefficeint of acrosin obtained by active enzyme centrifugation of partly purified preparations is in accordance with the sedimentation coefficient of the pure preparation estimated by conventional sedimentation velocity analysis. The sedimentation coefficient of acrosin is considerably decreased in slightly acidic solution (pH 4), indicating that changes in the tertiary structure occur upon acidification. The amino acid composition of the acrosin preparation homogeneous by electrophoretic and chromatographic criteria and in sedimentation studies was determined. Valine was found as the unique N-terminal amino acid. However, in microheterogeneous forms of acrosin, alanine and methionine were also detected in end group analysis.\n",
      "Characterization of protein kinases from Blepharisma intermedium. Three protein kinases (EC 2.7.1.37) were detected in Blepharisma and partially purified. The enzymes were most active with histone as substrate protein. The stability of the bond between phosphate and protein acceptor showed the characteristics of seryl- or threonylphosphate. Protein kinase I was solubilized by ultrasonication or freezing and thawing, while the enzymes II and III were readily solubilized by mild homogenization. Protein II and III were noticeably activated by cAMP and cGMP, while protein kinase I was inhibited by cAMP. Associated with protein kinase II and III activity was the ability to bind labeled cAMP. The following molecular weights were determined: 90000 for enzyme I, 280000 for enzyme II, and 95000 for enzyme III. Various apparent Michaelis constants were estimated.\n",

      "Effect of sodium butyrate on mammalian cells in culture: a review. Sodium butyrate produces reversible changes in morphology, growth rate, and enzyme activities of several mammalian cell types in culture. Some of these changes are similar to those produced by agents which increase the intracellular level of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) or by analogs of cAMP. Sodium butyrate increases the intracellular level of cAMP by about two fold in neuroblastoma cells; therefore, some of the effects of sodium butyrate on these cells may in part be mediated by cAMP. Sodium butyrate appears to have properties of a good chemotherapeutic agent for neuroblastoma tumors because the treatment of neuroblastoma cells in culture causes cell death and \"differentiation\"; however, it is either innocuous or produces reversible morphological and biochemical alterations in other cell types.\n",
      "On the nature of the presumed receptor for IgE on mast cells. III. Kinetics of the blocking of the PCA reaction by cell-free particulate preparations from rat peritoneal mast cells and effect of pH and calcium concentration on the reaction. The 'binding' of IgE to particulate preparations derived from sonicated purified rat mast cells was measured by the blocking of PCA titrations of the supernatant solutions from incubations with such preparations. It was found that the PCA blocking reaction was inhibited by the addition of calcium ion to the incubations. The blocking reaction was strongly dependent on the pH of the incubations, being maximal at pH values lower than 5-0. The blocking reaction proceeded in a linear manner for at least 3 h provided that no more than 70 percent of the amount of IgE initially supplied had been removed by the particulate fraction. Only mast cell-derived preparations were capable of effecting PCA blocking.\n",
      "Effect of glucose and sucrose on survival in batch culture of Streptococcus mutans C67-1 and a noncariogenic mutant, C67-25. The growth and survival of two strains of Streptococcus mutans in 5% (wt/vol) glucose or sucrose broth was investigated. S. mutans strain C67-1 showed little loss of viability after 30 h of incubation in batch culture in the presence of either sugar. S. mutans strain C67-25, a noncariogenic mutant of C67-1 that has lost the ability of the latter to produce sticky, insoluble extracellular polysaccharide when grown in sucrose broth, showed a dramatic loss of viability after 30 h of incubation in either glucose or sucrose broth, the effect being most marked in the presence of glucose. The loss of viability was shown to be due to acid production. Insoluble extracellular polysaccharide production appears to be a phenomenon favoring the survival of organisms subjected to high sucrose levels. Other factors must be involved, however, since there are differences between the two strains as regards their survival in glucose broth.\n",
      "Microcapsule of type III strains of group B Streptococcus: production and morphology. The yield of purified type III polysaccharide of group B Streptococcus was significantly improved by modification of the growth medium. Culture of organisms in standard Todd-Hewitt broth resulted in acid accumulation during the exponential phase of growth and poor yield of type III polysaccharide when extracted from cells by washing with neutral buffer solution. By increasing the buffering capacity of the broth medium, acid accumulation was prevented, and the number of viable cells was increased at the stationary phase of growth. Further, by increasing the concentration of glucose in the buffered medium, the yield of type III polysaccharide was increased two to three times. Electron microscopic investigations of cells grown in the modified broth medium demonstrated a thicker microcapsule than was found in organisms grown in standard broth.\n",
      "Central regulation of blood eosinophilia by the beta-adrenergic system in rats. The effect of isoprenaline and three different beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood eosinophilia was evaluated in the rat. Eosinopenic effect of isoprenaline was antagonized by intraperitoneal pretreatment with propranolol and by high but not low doses of practolol. Sotalol, a beta-blocker which in contrast to propranolol does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, did not affect the eosinophil count when injected intraperitoneally, but produced a marked increase in number of circulating eosinophils following intracerebroventricular injection. Intraperitoneal administration of isoprenaline and propranolol as well as intracerebroventricular injection of sotalol did not affect eosinophil count in adrenalectomized or hypophysectomized rats. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic agents regulate the number of circulating eosinophils through a central mechanism and that presence of both hypophysis and adrenal glands is required for this action.\n",
      "Comparison between two antibody populations in the EBV system: anti-MA versus neutralizing antibody activity. EBV-neutralizing antibody titers were determined in 11 sera derived from African Burkitt lymphoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and in the corresponding serum fractions retained above XM 100 Diaflo membranes after low pH treatment, and after recombination of the retained and passed fractions by neutralization of the acidified samples. They were compared with the corresponding antimembrane antigen (MA) titers in seven of the same sera. While all sera tested showed substantial increase of the anti-MA activity in the retained fraction, resulting in a significantly increased mean titer, EBV neutralizing activity did not change at all after identical treatment or changed only in a random fashion, resulting in stable mean titers. It is suggested that anti-MA and neutralizing antibodies are directed against at least partly different antigens on the virus.\n",
      "Gastric acid secretion, serum-gastrin levels and psychomotor function under the influence of placebo, insulin-hypoglycemia, and/or bromazepam. Gastric acid output, blood-glucose, serum-gastrin and psychomotor-performance were measured in four healthy subjects one hour before and two hours after the intravenous injection of (a) 2ml saline, (b) 0.2 U/kg b.w. insulin, (c) 0.1 mg/kg b.w. bromazepam. Each subject underwent one experiment of each type. The study was layed out as a Latin-square and analysed accordingly. Gastric acid secretion was measured by means of intragastric titration and a telemetering capsule; blood-glucose and serum-gastrin levels as well as psychomotor performance as a measure of vigilance were determined in 15-minute-intervals. In the saline series (a), none of the four parameters showed any systematic variation. In series (b), a bimodal response of acid output to insulin, initial inhibition and subsequent stimulation was observed in all subjects. Serum-gastrin levels showed only a slight and transient increase in the first thirty minutes. Psychomotor performance decreased markedly with progressing hypoglycemia, and increased when glucose levels rose again. In the bromazepan series (c), acid output and psychomotor performance decreased and, after the first hour, increased almost parallely, while glucose and gastrin levels remained unchanged. In series (d), an additive effect of insulin and bromazepam occurred: acid output and psychomotor performance were lower than after insulin alone; peak acid secretion, maximal hypoglycemia and peak of serum-gastrin were shifted to the right. It is concluded that the lowered basal as well as insulin-stimulated acid secretion after bromazepam is due to the central effect of the drug, and that this effect is mediated to the gastric glands directly via autonomic nervous pathways without involving a release of endogenous gastrin.\n",
      "[Correlation between plasma concentration and clinical effect of neuroleptics and antidepressants]. Results of investigations concerning the correlation between plasma concentrations and clinical effect of neuroleptics and antidepressives are summarised. In the case of neuroleptics there is in general no relationship between clinical parameters of activity and plasma concentration. For antidepressives there is, in most cases, a correlation between side-effects and plasma concentrations. Whether the therapeutic effect is dependent on the plasma concentration or not, is however open to some doubt. The practical value of plasma concentration estimations during therapy with the above mentioned drugs is therefore limited. Inadequate efficacy and/or poor tolerance can occasionally be explained by estimating plasma concentrations which alone, however, scarcely allow one to make prophecies. In determination of the optimal individual dosage must continue to be an empirical process based on clinical observations and experience.\n",
      "EEG sleep studies of insomniacs under flunitrazepam treatment. This study investigates the effect of flunitrazepam, a new benzodiazepine, on the sleep of insomniac patients under chronic treatment. Polygraphic recordings have shown that this drug decreases not only the activity of the wakefulness system, but also the activity of the synchronizing system of slow-wave sleep. The subjective feeling of improved and sounder sleep seems to be related to a decrease of wakefulness pressure as well as to a decrease of body motoricity, but not with the modification of sleep stages themselves. Flunitrazepam appears to possess some regulatory properties on REM sleep, since this stage is enhanced in patients with an initial low amount of REM sleep and decreased in those having a higher initial REM sleep. Flunitrazepam possesses potent and useful hypnogenic properties in man but does not induce physiological sleep.\n",
      "A histochemical study of the apparent deamination of proteins by sodium hypochlorite. The possible chemical mechanisms by which neutral solutions of sodium hypochlorite containing a high concentration of sodium chloride abolish the acidophilia of proteins in sections of fixed tissue are reviewed. The most probable one is the chlorination of the protein terminal amino groups, followed by the breakdown of the N-chloramine so formed into alpha-ketocarboxylic acid, nitrile or aldehyde groups. Hypochlorite solutions certainly do not deaminate tissue sections as was previously thought. Experimental evidence for the formation of relatively stable N-chloramine groups in situ and their limited conversion to aldehydes is reported. For example, the acidophilia of hypochlorite-treated sections was found to be restored after flooding them with hydriodic acid followed by the extraction of the liberated iodine with an alcohol. The significance of these experimental findings is discussed.\n",
      "Effects of dbcAMP and theophylline on rat adrenal medulla grown in tissue culture. Explants of rat adrenal medulla were grown in tissue culture. The effects of various doses of dbcAMP ranging from 0.001 mM up to 1 mM and equimolar amounts of theophylline were recorded by phase contrast optics and catecholamine histochemistry (glyoxylic acid method) over six days. There was a dose-dependent inhibition of the normally occurring outgrowth of Schwann cells, \"chromaffin\" cells and axons from the explants. Maintenance of glyoxylic acid-induced fluorescence in \"chromaffin\" cells was dose-dependent, too. Since theophylline is known to enhance intracellular levels of cAMP only, these effects are probably due to the action of cAMP. cAMP obviously maintains the degree of differentiation of chromaffin cells. Thus it could be argued that a certain degree of dedifferentiation is a prerequisite for the formation of axons from these cells.\n",

The thiocholine method for the histochemical detection of cholinesterases according to Karnovsky-Roots was adapted for unfixed cryostat sections by addition of the agar solution to the incubation mixture and by using the semipermeable membrane interposed between the section and the incubation medium. The procedure prevents the leakage of the enzyme activity of the section and is suitable for tissues where the cholinesterase activity is low.\n",

In alkaline medium and in the presence of cupric ions selenocystamine undergoes autoxidation and is entirely transformed into selenohypotaurine. Among the different metal ions tested, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Mg, Mn, only cupric ions are effective in catalyzing the reaction. The reaction shows an optimum around pH 13. In most respects the autoxidation of selenocystamine is similar to the alkaline autoxidation of cystamine.

      "The binding of nucleotides to 3'-nucleotidase from wheat germ. The 3'-mononucleotidase (3'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.6) from wheat germ has been purified 2,000 fold. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximatley 32,000, as judged by the use of G-100 gel filtration, and does not attack 2'- or 5'- nucleotides. In order to obtain some indications on the structural requirements for binding and reactivity, the purified enzyme has been subjected to kinetic analyses, including initial velocities with several 3'-ribomononucleotides, inhibition by 5'- nucleotides and nucleotide-analogues, and effect of pH and sulphydryl compounds. The data indicate one base binding site at the active site of the enzyme. This site appears to be the same involved in the binding of both substrates and inhibitors, with higher affinity for purine nucleotides than for pyrimidine compounds, in the order guanosine greater than adenosine greater than inosine greater than uridine greater than cytidine nucleotides.\n",

A method for the chemical fixation of the enzyme GABA-transaminase in nervous tissue is described. It is shown that after perfusion with a formaldehyde/glutaraldehyde fixative, activity of the enzyme in cerebellar cortex is demonstrable whilst cellular morphology is preserved. Results from the improved technique have shown new sites of GABA-transaminase activity in cerebellar cortex. In view of these results a special function for glial cells in this area of brain has been suggested.\n",

Keeping the arterial pH at 7.4 and PaCO2 at 40 mmHg in eight anesthetized dogs, we acutely raised plasma potassium concentration from 3.4 to 8.2 meq/1, then allowed it to decay back to control levels. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-blood electrical potential difference (pd) increased 13.2 mV per 10-fold increase in plasma [K+]. Again keeping arterial pH at 7.4 and PaCO2 at 40 mmHg, we elevated plasma [K+] in four dogs from 3.3 to 8.0 meq/1 and maintained this level for 6 h. We found 1) that the PD increased from a control value of +1.3 to +8.9mV, showing no tendency to decay over the 6 h; and 2) that the change in PD did not affect the distribution of Na+, K+, H+, Cl-, or HCO3- between blood and CSF over the 6 h. These results suggest that under these conditions the PD between CSF and blood may play no effective role in determining the distributions of these charged species by 6 h. These results are contrasted with recent findings which suggest that H+ and HCO3- are distributed according to passive forces between CSF and blood.\n",
      "Ontogeny of tracheal fluid, pulmonary surfactant, and plasma corticoids in the fetal lamb. We examined fetal plasma corticoids and flow rate, electrolyte composition, and surfactant content of tracheal fluid in chronic experiments with eight fetal lambs. From 120 to 148 days of gestation the rate of fluid production was 4.5 ml/kg per h, and there was no change in mean fluid sodium (147.8 meq/1), chloride (153.1 meq/1), calcium (2.2 mg/100 ml), and pH (6.23). Tracheal fluid potassium increased from 4.3 meq/1 at 120-130 days to 8.9 meq/1 at term, while plasma sodium, chloride, calcium, pH, and potassium were constant at 146.1 meq/1, 110.0 meq/1, 12.1 mg/100 ml, 7.39, and 4.0 meq/1, respectively. Plasma corticoids were less than 1.5 mug/100 ml total (0.3 mug/100 ml free) until 130 days, when they increased rapidly to 10.5 total (3.2 free) at 148 days. Surfactant was first detected in tracheal fluid between 124 and 133 days and its secretion increased rapidly after 135 days to a value of 125 mug/kg per h at 148 days. A sudden increase in fetal plasma corticoids does not seem to be the stimulus for appearance of surfactant in the lamb, although these hormones may induce the rapid accumulation of surfactant prior to delivery.\n",
      "Hydrogen ion concentration and oxygen uptake in an isolated canine hindlimb. Oxygen utilization (VO2) and lactate production by an isolated perfused canine hindlimb was evaluated at various hydrogen ion concentrations. A membrane lung perfusion system was established such that blood flow and temperature could be fixed at normal levels. Oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas flows to the membrane lung were independently regulated to provide a fixed arterial oxygen content (CaO2). By changing CO2 flow, the pH of the arterial blood was varied between 6.9 and 7.6 at 10-min intervals. The mean O2 delivery (CaO2 X blood flow) was between 16.3 ML O2/min and 20.5 ml O2/min. Standard error of the mean in each dog, however, was less than 0.4 ml O2/min. VO2 was linearly related to the pH of the perfusing blood: VO2% = 100.1 pH - 643 (r = 0.866). Oxygen consumption was inversely related to PCO2: VO2% = -0.62 PCO2 + 124, but the correlation was less good (r = 0.729). Lactate production was linearly related to the pH of the perfusing blood (above a pH of 7.4): lactate produced = 22.5 pH - 162.5 (r = 0.75). At a pH below 7.4, lactate was not produced. Oxygen consumption of skeletal muscle appears critically dependent on extracellular fluid pH. A change in pH of 0.1 alters VO2 almost exactly 10%. Alkalosis is a potent stimulus to lactic acid production by skeletal muscle.\n",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid sampling technique and Astrup pH and PCO2 values. The pH and PCO2 values measured by the Astrup technique were compared in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained using two different sampling techniques: 1) a direct or in vivo technique and 2) the widely accepted syringe sampling technique. In 65 pairs of measurements in 9 dogs it was found that the pH was always overestimated and the PCO2 always underestimated in the syringe sample when compared to the in vivo sample. The equations describing the relationships are as follows: 1) pH (syringe = 0.995 pH (in vivo) + 0.084 and 2) PCO2 (syringe) = 0.873 PCO2 (in vivo) + 0.2. The amount by which the syringe sample underestimated the true PCO2 value increased with the absolute PCO2 value, consistent with the possibility of there being a diffusional loss of CO2 during the transfer of CSF from the syringe to the pH electrode (PCO2 (in vivo)- PCO2 (syringe) = 2.4, 4.9, 7.5, and 10.0 mmHg at in vivo PCO2's of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mmHg). This study indicates that the technique used for sampling CSF is crucial to the expected accuracy of the results and that the number of transfers of CSF during the sampling and measurement procedures should be minimized in order to obtain reliable results.\n",
      "Hypoventilation in ponies after carotid body denervation. Seven ponies were subjected to carotid body denervation (CD) and two ponies were sham operated (S). Measurement of arterial blood gases and arterial blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acid-base balance were made prior to and 1,2,4,9, and 17 wks after surgery in unanesthetized animals. Resting ventilation and ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and NaCN infusion were assessed prior to and 2,9, and 17  wks after surgery. Alveolar hypoventilation in the CD ponies was marked 1-2 wk after surgery when VE and VA were reduced 40% and 10%, respectively, from control and PaCO2 was 12-15 mmHg above control. However, the effect was not nearly as great 4, 9, and 17 wk after surgery when the PaCO2 stabilized at approximately 6 mmHg above control PaCO2. Arterial blood pH was normal in the hypercapnic CD ponies, but CSF pH remained acid relative to normal throughout the 17-wk period. Changes in ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and NaCN tended to parallel changes in resting ventilation. These findings suggest: 1) the carotid bodies are essential in ponies to maintain normal ventilation: 2) in CD ponies peripheral chemosensitivity is partially regained at some unestablished locus; and 3) pH compensating mechanisms in chronically hypercapnic ponies function relatively better in blood than in CSF.\n",
      "Total and regional cerebral blood flow during moderate and severe exercise in miniature swine. To determine the influence of exercise on cerebral blood flow, we ran 14 swine at 3-6 mph and at 0-10% grades on a treadmill for 30 min at moderate and severe levels of exercise. Measuring heart rate, cardiac output, and aortic pressure via implanted probes, we injected 15-mum radiolabeled microspheres via the left atrium before and during exercise. We measured their distribution by gamma spectrometry, determining total cerebral blood flow, regional blood flow, and ratio of flow to gray and white matter. Heart rate, cardiac output, and aortic pressure rose progressively with increasing exercise. Total cerebral flow resembled that reported in humans, i.e., it did not change significantly with exercise. Regional flow distribution also failed to change significantly with exercise. The ratio of gray to white matter flow did not change except to the cerebellum where it rose significantly from resting values at both moderate and severe exercise. Gray matter received more flow than white matter during all three conditions of observation. Cerebral blood flow was remarkably constant during even severe exercise.\n",
      "Method for measuring hepatic uptake of oxygen or other blood-borne substances in situ. A preparation is described by which hepatic arterial blood flow and portal venous blood flow can be accurately and continuously measured while simultaneously providing a method by which multiple blood samples can be taken from the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein without disrupting hepatic hemodynamics or causing hemodilution. By this means hepatic uptake or release of blood-borne substances can be measured in situ and correlated with hemodynamic parameters. In 13 splenectomized cats, oxygen uptake by the denervated liver was 4.5 +/- 0.3 ml . min-1. 100 g-1 of tissue, representing 54% of total oxygen removed by the splanchnic bed. The hepatic hemodynamics determined by this method are similar to those reported by others in vivo and the metabolic state of the liver remained stable for at least 2 h during which an average of 29 blood samples were taken. Advantages of this preparation over other methods of obtaining similar data are discussed.\n",
      "Analysis of pesticide residues by chemical derivatization. II. N-methylcarbamates in natural water and soils. A method for the quantitative determination of several N-methylcarbamates in natural waters and the applicability of the derivative to soil samples using a previously published extraction procedure are described. After extraction of the carbamates from the substrate, the carbamates are hydrolyzed in a 10% methanol-potassium hydroxide solution to form the phenolic hydrolysis products, which are isolated and derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) bromide to produce the PFB ether derivatives. The PFB derivatives are cleaned up and fractionated on a silica gel microcolumn and determined by electron capture gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Eight organophosphate pesticides and 2 phthalate acid esters that hydrolyze to phenols or phthalic acid were evaluated as potential interferences and were found not to interfere with any of the carbamates tested. Quantitative determinations of 0.1 mug carbofuran and 3-ketocarbofuran and 0.5 mug carbaryl, metmercapturon, and Mobam in a 1 L water sample are possible. Propoxur was not determined at levels less than 1 mug/L due to the short GLC retention time of the derivative and interferences from the reagents at the lower levels.\n",
      "Separation of pesticide residues from lipids prior to gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. Lipids are separated from dieldrin, endrin, and p,p'-DDE residues by saponification in ethanolic sodium hydroxide, acidification with dilute sulfuric acid, and adsorption chromatography on deactivated alumina, using petroleum ether as the eluant. Dieldrin, endrin, and p,p'-DDE are efficiently recovered (95-102%), and p,p'-DDT is converted to p,p'-DDE, which is then recovered with high yield (90-96%). Extremely low lipid carryover (less than 0.3-0.5%) is observed for 0.5-1.0 g samples of chicken fat.\n",
      "Collaborative study of the Food Chemicals Codex method for the determination of the neutralizing value of sodium aluminum phosphate. Fifteen laboratories participated in a collaborative study to evaluate the Food Chemicals Codex method for the determination of the neutralizing value of sodium aluminum phosphate. The AOAC method for determining the neutralizing value of sodium acid pyrophosphate, sec. 8.010, was also included in the study. The precisions of the Food chemicals Codex method, based on the between-replicate standard deviation and on one collaborator making one determination, are 1.16 and 3.66, respectively. The Food Chemicals Codex method for the determination of the neutralizing value of sodium aluminum phosphate has been adopted as official first action.\n",
      "Affinity chromatography of trypsin and related enzymes. I. Preparation and characteristics of an affinity adsorbent containing tryptic peptides from protamine as ligands. An absorbent for the affinity chromatography of trypsin [EC 3.4.21.4] (AP Sepharose) was prepared. The ligand was a mixture of oligopeptides (mainly di- and tripeptides) containing L-arginine as carboxyl termini, and was obtained from a tryptic digest of protamine. Trypsin was absorbed at relatively low pH (7-4), but was not absorbed at the optimum pH of catalysis (8.2). This was clearly explained on the basis of the pH dependence of the interaction of trypsin with its products. Inactivated trypsin, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsin were not absorbed. The absorption of active trypsin was interferred with by either benzamidine or urea. From these observations, it is evident that AP Sepharose is an affinity adsorbent. AP Sepharose was useful for purification of commercial bovine trypsin. A preliminary application for the purification of Streptomyces griseus trypsin was also successful.\n",
      "Effects on tryptophyl absorption of the ionization of the catalytic carboxyls in hen and turkey lysozymes. The difference spectra of hen and turkey egg-white lysozymes [EC 3.2.1.17] produced by acidification were measured. The difference spectra of both lysozymes had peaks at 295 and 301 nm which are characteristic of tryptophyl residues. The pH dependence curves of the extinction differences (delta eplision) at 301 nm and 295 nm for hen lysozyme were identical with the corresponding curves for turkey lysozyme. The pH dependence of delta eplision at 301 nm was analyzed assuming that the extinction at 301 nm is due to Trp 108 only, which interacts with the catalytic carboxyls, Glu 35 and Asp 52.  The macroscopic pK values of Glu 35 and Asp 52 in both lysozymes thus determined were 6.0 and 3.3, respectively. These values were in excellent agreement with those determined by measuring the pH dependence of the circular dichroic band at 305 nm (Kuramitsu et al. (1974) J. Biochem, 76, 671-683; (1975) ibid. 77, 291-301). The pH dependence of delta eplision at 295 nm could not be completely explained in terms of the electrostatic effects of the catalytic groups on Trp 108.\n",
      "Resonance Raman scattering from hemoproteins. Effects of ligands upon the Raman spectra of various C-type cytochromes. Resonance Raman spectra were measured for various C-type cytochromes (mammalian cytochrome c, bacterial cytochrome c3, algal photosynthetic cytochrome f, and alkylated cytochrome c) and a B-type cytochrome (cytochrome b5) in their reduced and oxidized states. (1) For ferrous alkylated cytochrome c, a Raman line sensitive to the replacement of an axial ligand of the heme iron uas found around 1540 cm=1. This ligand-sensitive Raman line indicated the transition from acidic (1545 cm-1) to alkaline (1533 cm-1) forms with pK 7.9. The pH dependence of the Raman spectrum corresponded well to that of the optical absorption spectra. (2) For ferrous cytochrome f, the ligand-sensitive Raman line was found at the same frequency as cytochrome c (1545 cm-1). Accordingly two axial ligands are likely to be histidine and methionine as in cytochrome c. (3) For ferrous cytochrome c3, the frequency of the ligand-sensitive Raman line was between those of cytochrome c and cytochrome b5. Since two axial ligands of the heme iron in cytochrome c3 might be histidines. However, a combination of histidine and methionine as a possible set of two axial ligands was not completely excluded for one or two of the four hemes. (4) In ferrous cytochrome b5, two weak Raman lines appeared at 1302 and 1338 cm-1 instead of the strongest band at 1313 cm-1 of C-type ferrous cytochromes. This suggests the practical use of these bands for the identification of types of cytochromes. The difference in frequency and intensity between B- and C-types of hemes implies that the low effective symmetry of the heme in ferrous cytochrome c is due to vibrational coupling of ring modes with peripheral substituents rather than geometrical disortion of heme.\n",
      "Studies on the microsomal electron-transport system of anaerobically grown yeast. III. Spectral characterization of cytochrome P-450. A carbon monoxide-binding pigment which shows an absorption peak at about 450 nm in the reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum was purified from the microsomal fraction of yeast grown anaerobically. The spectral characteristics of the pigment were practically identical with those of cytochrome P-450 of hepatic microsomes, especially from polycyclic hydrocarbon-induced animals. The pigment was denatured to P-420, and bound with ethyl isocyanide in the reduced state. Although Type I spectral change was not evident, the pigment showed Type II and modified Type II spectral changes upon binding with some organic compounds, as in the case of hepatic cytochrome P-450. These observations clearly indicate that the carbon monoxide-binding pigment of yeast microsomes may be designated as cytochrome P-450 of yeast.\n",
      "Polarographic studies on ubiquinone-10 and rhodoquinone bound with chromatophores from Rhodospirillum rubrum. Redox components bound with chromatophores of Rhodospirillum rubrum, and pure samples of ubiquinone-10 and rhodoquinone were studied polarographically at 24 degrees. In a mixture of ethanol and water (4 : 1, v/v) at pH 7, ubiquinone-10 and rhodoquinone had half-wave potentials (E1/2) OF +43 MV and -63 mV, respectively. For both quinones, values of the electron transfer number (n) were 2 , and plots of E1/2 versus pH formed straight lines with slopes of -30 mV/pH in the neutral pH range; thus, values of the proton transfer number (n-a) were estimated to be 1 for both quinones. When bound with chromatophores, ubiquinone-10 and rhodoquinone had E1/2 values of +50 mV (n=2) and -30 mV (n=2), respectively, at pH 7. Values of (n-a) were estimated to be 1 for ubiquinone-10 and 2 for rhodoquinone. A component (POC-170) thought to be one of the active center bacteriochlorophylls (Liac-890) was characterized; it has E1/2 value of -170 mV at pH 7 and its oxidation-reduction is possibly brought about by dehydrogenation-hydrogenation. Conceivably, the oxidation-reduction sites of ubiquinone-10, rhodoquinone and POC-170 partly, if not all, exist on the surface of chromatophore membrane or project outside the membrane, because of their accessibility to the polarographic electrode.\n",
      "Effect of metal ions in the culture medium on the stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase activity of Mycobacterium phlei. A particulate fraction prepared from Mycobacterium phlei grown in a metal-deficient medium exhibited a greatly reduced activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase compared to that from normally grown cells. Metal deficiency, however, had no effect on the FAD-dependent NADPH-cytochrome C reductase activity, which has been suggested to participate in the desaturation process. When the cells were grown in the deficient medium supplemented with both Fe2+ and Mg2+, the desaturase activity was restored to the normal level. Supplementation with Mg2+ alone promoted growth but did not restore the desaturase activity, whereas Fe2+ alone did cause a significant restoration. Among the various metal ions tested, only Fe2+ and Fe3+ enhanced the formation of desaturase activity in the deficient medium. When added to the assay medium in vitro, Fe2+ and Fe3+ did not stimulate the desaturase activity of the particulate fraction from the deficient cells. Cultivation in the metal-deficient medium had essentially no effect on the levels of cytochromes in the particulate fraction, but dramatically decreased the non-heme iron content and the amount of a high-spin ferric species exhibiting an ESR signal at g=4.3. No labile sulfur could be detected in the normal or metal-deficient particulate fractions. It is concluded that the presence of iron ions in the culture medium is necessary for the synthesis and/or assembly of the terminal portion of the desaturase system.\n",
      "Photoaffinity labeling of concanavalin A. Preparation of a concanavalin A derivative with reduced valence. Concanavalin A (Con A) was labeled with p-azidophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside under ultraviolet irradiation and the reaction products were separated by affinity chromatography on Sephadex G-100 at pH 5. One of the Con A derivatives thus obtained was characterized as a monovalent dimer at pH 5 and a divalent tetramer at pH 7 by sedimentation equilibrium and equilibrium dialysis, indicating that this photoaffinity labeling did not alter the quaternary structure of Con A. In agreement with these results, the labeled Con A did not show the capacity to precipitate glycogen at pH 5, but it formed precipitates with glycogen at pH 7. Although its hemagglutinating activity was found to be weaker than that of the native Con A, the dose-response cure of the labeled Con A in the mitogenic stimulation of human peripheral lymphocytes was almost identical to that of the native con A.\n",
      "Chemical modification of carboxyl groups of fibrinogen and its effect on the binding of cationic detergent. Carboxyl groups of native human fibrinogen were modified with glycine methyl ester and 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. It seemed likely that the modification occurred stepwise. Approximately 26% of the carboxyl groups of fibrinogen was modified finally. The modified fibrinogen had no interaction with cationic detergent, and did not form any complex with the detergent. In dilute acid, fibrinogen was observed to show only a slight interaction with cationic detergent. It is probable that the exposed and ionized carboxyl groups are essential for the formation of a complex between fibrinogen and cationic detergent.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of proteinase inhibitors from adzuki beans (Phaseolus angularis). Two proteinase inhibitors, designated as inhibitors I and II, were purified from adzuki beans (Phaseolus angularis) by chromatographies on DEAE- and CM-cellulose, and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column. Each inhibitor shows unique inhibitory activities. Inhibitor I was a powerful inhibitor of trypsin [EC 3.4.21.4], but essentially not of chymotrypsin ]EC 3.4.21.1]. On the other hand, inhibitor II inhibited chymotrypsin more strongly than trypsin. The molecular weights estimated from the enzyme inhibition were 3,750 and 9,700 for inhibitors I and II, respectively, assuming that the inhibitions were stoichiometric and in 1 : 1 molar ratio. The amino acid compositions of both inhibitors closely resemble those of low molecular weight inhibitors of other leguminous seeds: they contain large amounts of half-cystine, aspartic acid and serine, and little or no hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids. Inhibitor I lacks both tyrosine and tryptophan residues. The molecular weights were calculated to be 7,894 and 8,620 for inhibitors I and II, respectively. The reliability of these molecular weights was confirmed by the sedimentation equilibrium and 6 M guanidine gel filtration methods. On comparison with the values obtained from enzyme inhibition, it was concluded that inhibitor I and two trypsin inhibitory sites on the molecule, whereas inhibitor II had one chymotrypsin and one trypsin inhibitory sites on the molecule.\n",
      "Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase of bovine cerebrum. Characterization and mechanisms of inhibition by silver ions. Attempts were made to characterize mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase [L-malate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37] (M-MDH) purified from bovine cerebrum and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for inhibition of the enzymic activity by Ag+. The molecular weights of the native enzyme and its subunits were 54,000-55,000 and 30,000-32,000, respectively. In general, the physiochemical and catalytic properties of bovine cerebral M-MDH was not very different from those of other corresponding mammalian enzymes. Incubation of the enzyme with Ag+ caused the loss of equivalent amounts of sulfhydryls with a parallel decrease of the enzymic activity. When the enzyme was exposed to 2-, 3.5-, and 5-fold molar excesses of Ag+, the enzymic activity showed an initial rapid fall and a subsequent slow restoration to a partially inactivated level (60-70, 45-50, and 15-20% of an untreated control, respectively), while the alpha-helical content of the enzyme fell exponentially with time. A 7-fold molar excess of Ag+ reduced both the enzymic activity and the alpha-helical content to a much greater degree and no restoration of the enzymic activity was observed. The Km values of Ag+-inactivated enzyme for NADH and oxaloacetate were the same as those of the native enzyme. The data suggest that Ag+ could inhibit enzymic activity both by reducing the structural regularity of the enzyme molecule and by attacking sulfhydryl groups necessary for the catalytic activity of bovine cerebral M-MDH.\n",
      "Double-headed protease inhibitors from black-eyed peas. II. Structural studies by optical absorption and circular dichroism. Two new double-headed protease inhibitors from black-eyed peas have amino acid compositions typical of the low molecular weight protease inhibitors from legume seeds. Black-eyed pea chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) contains no tryptophan, 1 tyrosine, and 14 half-cystines out of 83 amino acid residues per monomer. Black-eyed pea trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI) contains no tryptophan, 1 tyrosine, and 14 half-cystines out of 75 residues per monomer. The molar extinctions at 280 nm are 2770 for BEPCI and 3440 for BEPTI. The single tyrosyl residue is very inaccessible to solvent in native BEPCI and BEPTI at neutral pH and titrates anomalously with an apparent pK = 12. Ionization of tyrosine is complete in 13 hours above pH 12. No heterogeneity of the local environment of the tyrosyl residues in different subunits can be detected spectrophotometrically. The large number of cystine residues leads to an intense and complex near-ultraviolet CD spectrum with cystine contributions in the regions of 248 and 280 nm and tyrosine contributions at 233 and 280 nm. An intact disulfide structure is required for appearance of the tyrosyl CD bands. The inhibitors are unusually resistant to denaturation when compared with similar low molecular weight proteins of high disulfide content. All observations are consistent with a far more rigid structure for BEPCI and BEPTI than for a typical protein.\n",
      "Double-headed protease inhibitors from black-eyed peas. III. Subunit interactions of the native and half-site chemically modified proteins. The chemical modification of two new double-headed-protease inhibitors from black-eyed peas, a trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) and a trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI) with dansyl chloride was investigated under various conditions. The NH2-terminal serine of both BEPCI and BEPTI, the 4 lysyl residues of BEPCI, and 4 of the 5 lysyl residues of BEPTI, could not be dansylated in the absence of urea. The single tyrosine per subunit of BEPCI and BEPTI was unreactive even in the presence of urea but could be labeled with half-site reactivity by the Celite method. Lysine, NH2-terminal serine, and tyrosine were reactive in fully reduced, carbamidomethylated BEPCI and BEPTI. Gel filtration was used to study the subunit interactions of BEPCI and BEPTI. At pH 8 or pH 3.0 there is a complex set of multiple equilibria with widely differing rates of attainment. We have found evidence for a rapid dimer-tetramer equilibrium, a distinct moderate rate dimer-tetramer equilibrium, a very slow monomer-dimer equilibrium, and postulate slow isomerization of the two forms of dimer and the two forms of tetramer. The monomer-dimer equilibrium is quite unusual in that the dimer is stabilized by chaotropic ions and even slightly by guanidine HC1. In contrast to the complex pattern seen in native BEPCI, the half-site, dansylated BEPCI exists at similar concentration exclusively as a tetramer at neutral pH.\n",
      "Affinity labeling of the primary bilirubin binding site of human serum albumin. A label for the bilirubin binding sites of human serum albumin was synthesized by reacting 2 mol of Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3'-sulfonate) with 1 mol of bilirubin. This yielded a water-soluble derivative in which both carboxyl groups of bilirubin were converted to reactive enol esters. Covalent labeling was achieved by reacting the label with human serum albumin under nitrogen at pH 9.4 and 20 degrees. Under the same conditions, no covalent binding to the monomers of several proteins could be demonstrated. The number of binding sites for bilirubin and the label were found to be the same, and competition experiments with bilirubin showed inhibition of covalent labeling. The absorption, fluorescence and CD spectra of the label in a complex with human serum albumin were similar to those of the bilirubin human serum albumin complex. However, following covalent attachment to the spectral properties were changed, indicating loss of conformational freedom of the chromophore. Labeling ratios were selected to result in the incorporation of less than 1 mol of label/mol of human serum albumin. Under these conditions, labeling is thought to occur primarily at the high affinity binding site.\n",
      "Acylation of subtilisin Carlsberg by phenyl esters. Approximate Hammett reaction constants rho calculated from k2/K8 values of several phenyl esters of N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, hippuric acid, and beta-phenylpropionic acid are 0.0, 0.4, and 1.0 respectively. To determine whether the lack of substituent effect of k2/K8 with the N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine esters is a result of substituent-insensitive k2 or rate-limiting association of enzyme and substrate, pH-k2/K8 deependences and solvent deuterium isotope effects were determined for certain of the substrates and compared with those found with the corresponding hippurates and beta-phenylpropionates. In the pH range 5 to 8, k2/K8 of the phenyl and 4-nitrophenyl esters of each series is dependent upon the unprotonated form of an enzymatic base of apparent pKa approximately 7.4, identical with the pKa found for the free enzyme. With the phenyl esters of each substrate class, k2/K8 decreased by 2 to 3 times in deuterium oxide compared with water. The results suggest that a step involving a general base-catalyzed proton transfer, almost certainly k2, is rate-limiting with the N-acetyl-L-phenylalaninates, as well as the hippurates and beta-phenylpropionates. Attack by the protein on the latter substrates is prediminantly nucleophilic, judged by the similarity of rho in the enzymatic and reference hydroxide ion-catalyzed hydrolyses. The power rho values for the N-acetyl-L-phenylalaninates and hippurates could result from an electrophilic component in their hydrolytic mechanisms.\n",
      "Inhibition by superoxide dismutase of methemoglobin formation from oxyhemoglobin. The formation of methemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin in a solution containing photoreduced riboflavin and oxygen was inhibited by superoxide dismutase. The rate of the reaction was pH-dependent in the range of 6.8 to 7.8, increasing as the pH was reduced. Inhibition by superoxide dismutase was enhanced as the EDTA concentration increased and was dependent on enzymatic activity. Under conditions in which superoxide dismutase inhibition was incomplete, catalase inhibited the reaction but mannitol had no effect. The data support the mediation of methemoglobin formation by superoxide. The hypothesis is offered that superoxide anion reduced the heme-bound oxygen in oxygemoglobin by one electron, permitting the subsequent dissociation of ferrihemoglobin and peroxide. The ability of superoxide dismutase to inhibit the formation of methemoglobin may represent one of its functions in the mature erythrocyte.\n",
      "Transport and metabolism of vitamin B6 in the yeast Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228. Active transport of pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine occurs in resting cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 and can lead to intracellular concentrations of free vitamin much higher than those supplied externally. The initial Km for pyridoxine uptake is 3.6 x 10(-7) M at 30 degrees and pH 4.5, which are optimum for growth. Transport is inhibited by many unphosphorylated vitamin analogs, the most effective being 5'-deoxypyridoxine, 5'-deoxypridoxal, toxopyrimidine, 4'-deoxypyridoxine, and 3-amino-3-deoxypyridoxine. Two distinct uptake systems that differ in structural specificity and ionic requirements are present. One, with optimum pH of 3.5, transports pyridoxal effectively, but not pyridoxamine; the other (optimum pH 6.0) transports pyridoxamine effectively, but not pyridoxal. Both systems transport pyridoxine, while neither transports pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Other properties of these systems are similar, indicating that they share certain elements in common. An initial temperature optimum of 30 degrees is observed for pyrodoxine transport and, at this temperature, an \"overshoot\" in intracellular vitamin levels, with subsequent decrease to a constant level, occurs with time. It appears that intracellular vitamin, or a derivative, activates the exit mechanism for the vitamin. Exit rates also depend on the resuspension buffer and are increased in the presence of glucose and decreased by azide. Above 30 degrees net uptake of pyridoxine drops initially, then rapidly increases to a second optimum at 50 degrees; the uptake system is inactivated at about 55 degrees. The optimum at 50 degrees apparently results from activation of inflow as exit is rapid and is accelerated by azide. No overshoot was detected at 50 degrees, so it appears that the exit system is not regulated by intracellular vitamin at this temperature. A phase transition in membrane lipids occurs at 30 degrees and may be responsible for the change in properties of the inflow and exit mechanisms above this temperature.\n",
      "Transport and metabolism of vitamin B6 in Salmonella typhimurium LT2. Salmonella typhimurium LT2 concentrates radioactivity intracellularly from [3H]pyridoxal or [3H]pyridoxine up to 25 times the external concentration. After 1 min of uptake intracellular radioactivity is found as phosphorylated vitamin B6. The process is sensitive to temperature and is maximally active at pH 8.1, but under the conditions tested it is insensitive to monovalent cations or metabolic inhibitors, and does not require an exogenous energy source. The Km values for uptake of pyridoxine and pyridoxal are 2.0 x 10(-7) M and 1.2 x 10(-7) M, respectively; [3H]pyridoxamine is not transported. Evidence is presented for an uptake mechanism involving facilitated diffusion followed by trapping by pyridoxal kinase. S. typhimurium also appears to lack a periplasmic binding protein for vitamin B6.\n",
      "Correlation of the kinetics of electron transfer activity of various eukaryotic cytochromes c with binding to mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. 1. A detailed study of cytochrome c oxidase activity with Keilin-Hartree particles and purified beef heart enzyme, at low ionic strength and low cytochrome c concentrations, showed biphasic kinetics with apparent Km1 = 5 x 10(-8) M, and apparent Km2 = 0.35 to 1.0 x 10(-6) M. Direct binding studies with purified oxidase, phospholipid-containing as well as phospholiptaining aid-depleted, demonstrated two sites of interaction of cytochrome c with the enzyme, with KD1  less than or equal to 10(-7) M, and KD2 = 10(-6) M. 2. The maximal velocities as low ionic strength increased with pH and were highest above ph 7.5. 3. The presence and properties of the low apparent Km phase of the kinetics were strongly dependent on the nature and concentration of the anions in the medium. The multivalent anions, phosphate, ADP, and ATP, greatly decreased the proportion of this phase and similarly decreased the amount of high affinity cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex formed. The order of effectiveness was ATP greater than ADP greater than P1 and since phosphate binds to cytochrome c more strongly than the nucleotides, it is concluded that the inhibition resulted from anion interaction with the oxidase. 4mat low concentrations bakers' yeast iso-1, bakers' yeast iso-1, horse, and Euglena cytochromes c at high concentrations all attained the same maximal velocity. The different proportions of low apparent Km phase in the kinetic patterns of these cytochromes c correlated with the amounts of high affinity complex formed with purified cytochrome c oxidase. 5. The apparent Km for cytochrome c activity in the succinate-cytochrome c reductase system of Keilin-Hartree particles was identical with that obtained with the oxidase (5 x 10(-8) M), suggesting the same site serves both reactions. 6. It is concluded that the observed kinetics result from two catalytically active sites on the cytochrome c oxidase protein of different affinities for cytochrome c. The high affinity binding of cytochrome c to the mitochondrial membrane is provided by the oxidase and at this site cytochrome c can be reduced by cytochrome c1. Physiological concentrations of ATP decrease the affinity of this binding to the point that interaction of cytochrome c with numerous mitochondrial pholpholipid sites can competitively remove cytochrome c from the oxidase. It is suggested that this effect of ATP represents a possible mechanism for the control of electron flow to the oxidase.\n",
      "Autooxidation and hydroxylation reactions of oxygenated cytochrome P-450cam. Oxy-ferrous substrate-bound cytochrome P-450cam (mrsO2) autooxidizes in the absence of its specific effector protein, putidaredoxin, without hydroxylating the substrate, camphor. The autooxidation is first order with an activation energy of 17 kcal mol-1 at 25 degrees, pH 7.0. Substrate removal and low pH accelerate the reaction. The product, 5-exo-OH camphor, and a nonhydroxylated pseudosubstrate, norcamphor, stabilize the complex in a manner similar to camphor. Increased oxidation rate of mrsO2 and substrate hydroxylation are induced by putidaredoxin, rebredoxin, cytochrome b5, and the apoproteins of the latter two. Dihydrolipoic acid and other dithiols also replace putidaredoxin as effector molecules, but 1000-fold higher concentrations are required. Effector molecules do not increase the autooxidation rate of mrsO2 unless camphor, norcamphor, or another pseudosubstrate is present. Kinetic evidence is presented showing that an active complex between mrsO2 and effector is a required intermediate in mixed function oxidation.\n",
      "Demonstration of a precursor-product relationship between soluble and cross-linked elastin, and the biosynthesis of the desmosines in vitro. Direct evidence showing that a soluble form of elastin is the precursor of cross-linked elastin was obtained from pulse-chase experiments using chick embryo aortas and by demonstrating the conversion of soluble elastin into cross-linked elastin in a cell-free system. Acetic acid extracts of embryonic chick aorta pulse-labeled with [14C]lysine contain two radioactive proteins of molecular weights 74,000 and 138,000 which have been identified previously as soluble elastin and the pro-alpha chain of collagen, respectively. In pulse-chase experiments, the radioactivity incorporated in the soluble elastin during the pulse with [14C]lysine disappeared during a 24-hour chase with [12C]lysine and 89% of that which disappeared was accounted for in the desmosines of alkali-insoluble elastin. The disappearance of the radioactivity from the soluble fraction and its appearance in the desmosines of elastin were inhibited by beta-aminopropionitrile, a specific inhibitor of the cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase. In addition in vitro experiments, it was shown that the radioactivity in the desmosines of elastin can arise from that present in an acid-soluble precursor protein. This precursor protein is soluble elastin, as demonstrated by the formation of desmosines when a homogeneous preparation of soluble elastin was incubated with purified lysyl oxidase.\n",
      "Chondroitinase C from Flavobacterium heparinum. A chondroitinase that acts upon chondroitin sulfate C and hyaluronic acid was isolated from Flavobacterium heparinum. This enzyme was seperated from constitutional chondroitinase AC and an induced chondroitinase B also present in extracts of F. heparinum previously grown in the presence of chondroitin sulfates A, B or C. The enzyme acts upon chondroitin sulfate C producing tetrasaccharide plus an unsaturated 6-sulfated disaccharide (delta Di-6S), and upon hyaluronic acid producing unsaturated nonsulfated disaccharide (delta Di-OS). Chondroitin sulfate A is also degraded producing oligosaccharides and delta Di-6S but not delta Di-4S. The chondroitinase C is also distinguished from the chondroitinases B and AC by several properties, such as effect of ions, temperature for optimal activity, and susceptibility to increasing salt concentrations. The substrate specificity of the chondroitinase C is different from that of any other chondroitinase or hyaluronidase described so far.\n",
      "Transport mechanisms in isolated plasma membranes. Nucleoside processing by membrane vesicles from mouse fibroblast cells grown in defined medium. Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from a subline of L929 mouse fibroblasts grown on defined medium in the absence of serum. These vesicles were not significantly contaminated by mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum. The isolation procedure, a modification of that originally developed by McKeel and Jarett (McKeel, D.W., and Jarett, L. (1970) J. Cell Biol. 44, 417-432) employs mechanical homogenization in isotonic medium followed by differential centrifugation. The resultant plasma membrane vesicles take up radioactivity when exposed to uniformly labeled nucleosides. Two subfractions of the plasma membrane were isolated, distinguished by their differing activity of 5'-nucleotidase and (Na+,K+)-stimulated ATPase, two well known plasma membrane enzyme markers. Uptake of nucleoside radioactivity was extensively studied in one subfraction; it was linear with time and membrane concentration over ranges used for the studies. Apparent Km values for uptake of radioactivity from adenosine, inosine, and uridine were 7.1 +/- 26 muM, respectively. Uptake of radioactivity from all three nucleosides exhibits a broad pH optimum from pH 7 to pH 9, but falls off rapidly at lower pH. N-Ethylmaleimide was an effective inhibitor of uptake of radioactivity from all three nucleosides; uptake of radioactivity from uridine is more sensitive than uptake of radioactivity from the purine nucleosides. Adenosine inhibited uptake of radioactivity from inosine more than from uridine. Inosine inhibited the uptake of radioactivity from adenosine, but uridine did not. Caffeine and 6-methylaminopurine riboside (6-N-methyladenosine differentially inhibit uptake of radioactivity from adenosine and inosine, and thus the vesicles apparently possess seperate transport systems for uptake of radioactivity from purine nucleosides and from uridine.\n",
      "Metallophosphoryl and Apophosphoryl Alkaline Phosphatases. The noncovalent phosphate (E-P) and covalent phosphory (E-P) complexes of Zn(II), Cd(II), and apoalkaline phosphatases of Escherichia coli have been studied by stopped flow kinetic methods and 32P-labeling techniques. With 2,4-dinitrophenylphosphate as substrate, preincubation of the Zn(II) enzyme with Pi at pH 8 slows the pre-steady state burst rate, but does not affect the burst magnitude of 1 mol of ROH per enzyme dimer. Preincubation of the enzyme with Pi at pH 5.5 reduces the burst magnitude by one-half, as well as reducing the burst rate. Reduction of the burst magnitude as a function of the pH of the preincubation with Pi follows the same function as that previously established for the formation of E-P. Hence, ROP phosphorylates the enzyme by displacing phosphate from E-P during a pre-steady state reaction, while E-P turns over at the steady state velocity.\n",
      "31P NMR of phosphate and phosphonate complexes of metalloalkaline phosphatases. 31P NMR spectra of phosphate and phosphonate complexes of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase have been obtained by Fourier transform NMR methods. One equivalent of P1i, bound to Zn(II) alkaline phosphatase, pH 8, gives rise to a single 31P resonance 2 ppm downfield from that for Pi, and assignable to the noncovalent complex, E-P. Inorganic phosphate in excess of 1 eq per enzyme dimer gives rise to a resonance at the position expected for free Pi. At pH 5.1, a second resonance appears 8.5 ppm downfield from that for free Pi, and is assignable to the covalent complex, E-P. The large downfield shift suggests that the enzyme phosphoryl group is highly strained with an O-P-O bond angle of under 100 degrees.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of indole-3-acetaldehyde reductases from Cucumis sativus. In a continuing study of the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory mechanisms governing indole-3-acetic acid (auxin) formation, we report the isolation and initial characterization of three distinct indole-3-acetaldehyde reductases from cucumber seedlings. These enzymes catalyze the reduction of indole-3-acetaldehyde to indole-3-ethanol with the concomitant oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+. Two of the reductases are specific for NADPH as second substrate, while the third is specific for NADH. The enzymes show a strong specificity for indoleacetaldehyde, with apparent Km values of 73mum, 130mum, and 400mum being calculated for the two NADPH-specific reductases and the NADH-specific reductase, respectively. Under no conditions of substrate concentration, incubation time, or assay method could the reverse reaction be observed. Chromatography on a calibrated Sephadex gel column led to estimated molecualr weights of 52,000 and 17,000 for the NADPH-specific reductases, while a value of 33,000 was obtained for the NADH-specific reductase. Both NADPH-specific reductases showed a pH optimum of 5.2 with a secondary optimum at 7.0, and both enzymes were activated by increasing ionic strength. The NADH-specific reductase showed a pH optimum of 7.0 with a secondary optimum at 6.1 and was slightly inhibited by increasing ionic strength.\n",
      "Calcium transport driven by a proton gradient and inverted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli. Calcium transport into inverted vesicles of Escherichia coli was observed to occur without an exogenous energy source when an artificial proton gradient was used. The orientation of the proton gradient was acid inside and alkaline outside. Either phosphate or oxalate was necessary for transport, as was found for respiratory-driven or ATP-driven uptake (Tsuchiya, T., and Rosen, B.P. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7687-7692). Phosphate accumulation was found to occur in conjunction with calcium accumulation. Calcium transport driven by an artificial proton gradient was stimulated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the Mg2+ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3). Valinomycin, which catalyzes electrogenic potassium movement, stimulated calcium accumulation, while nigericin, which catalyzes electroneutral exchange of potassium and protons, inhibited both artificial proton gradient-driven transport and respiratory-driven transport. Other properties of the proton gradient-driven system and the previously reported energy-linked calcium transport system are similar, indicating that calcium is transported by the same carrier whether energy is supplied through an artificial proton gradient or an energized membrane state. These results suggest the existence of a calcium/proton antiport.\n",
      "Stoichiometry of H+ ejection during respiration-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ by rat liver mitochondria. We have investigated the energy-dependent uptake of Ca2+ by rat liver mitochondria with succinate as respiratory substrate with rotenone added to block NAD-linked electron transport. In the presence of 3-hydroxybutyric or other permeant monocarboxylic acids Ca2+ was taken up to extents approaching those seen in the presence of phosphate. The quantitative relationship between cation and anion uptake was determined from the slope of a plot of 3-hydroxybutyrate uptake against Ca2+ uptake, a method which allowed determination of the stoichiometry without requiring ambiguous corrections for early nonenergized or nonstoichiometric binding events. This procedure showed that 2 molecules of 3-hydroxtbutyrate were accumulated with each Ca2+ ion. Under these conditions close to 2 Ca2+ ions and 4 molecules of 3-hydroxybutyrate were accumulated per pair of electrons per energy-conserving site of the respiratory chain. Since 3-hydroxybutyrate must be protonated to pass the membrane as the undissociated free acid, it is concluded that 4 protons were ejected (and subsequently reabsorbed) per pair of electrons per energy-conserving site, in contrast to the value 2.0 postulated by the chemiosmotic hypothesis.\n",
      "Identification of albumin as the serum factor essential for the growth of activated human lymphocytes. Albumin from human, bovine, or rabbit serum supported the growth of concanavalin A-stimulated human thymus-derived lymphocytes equally well. This activity was completely abolished by pepsin digestion. It was shown for bovine serum albumin that the albumin molecule itself, and neither an impurity nor a factor bound to albumin was essential for the growth of lymphocytes. This conclusion was based on observations that the growth-promoting activity could not be removed from albumin, and that the specific activity of albumin remained unaltered after the following procedures: molecular sieving at pH 7.5 at pH 3.0, and in 8 M urea at pH 6.6; ion exchange chromatography at pH 4.3 and in 8 M urea at pH 7.2; isoelectric focusing; charcoal treatment; acetone precipitation; and reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 8 M urea. Dimeric albumin was found to support growth of lymphocytes as well as monomeric albumin, and mercaptalbumin and non-mercaptalbumin were shown to have equal activity.\n",

      "Determination of indomethacin in serum and urine by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. A specific and sensitive method for the quantitative determination of indomethacin in serum and urine is described. The drug is extracted at pH 5.0 with 1,2-dichloroethane and a portion of the organic extract is concentrated and made to react with diazoethane in diethyl ether. The ethyl ester derivative is analyzed by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography, quantitation being achieved by comparison of peak areas for samples and standards, which are prepared in serum or urine and treated in the same manner as the samples. The limit of sensitivity is 50 ng/ml and the relative standard derivation for repeat determinations on the same sample is about 3%.\n",
      "Separation of some typical Krebs cycle acids by high-speed isotachophoresis. In order to perform a required separation, an experimental procedure for the selection of suitable operating conditions is suggested and discussed. It is based on measurements of the dependences of the relative effective mobilities of the components under investigation on the pH of the leading electrolyte. The procedure was applied to a set of typical Krebs cycle acids and the values of the relative effective mobilities measured are given in tables and graphs. A pH of 3.8 was selected as the most suitable. At this value, the acids investigated were successfully separated in less than 4 min using 0.011 M hydrochloric acid + beta-alanine as the leading electrolyte.\n",

      "Plasma androgen responce to hCG stimulation in prepubertal boys with hypospadias and cryptorchidism. Serum levels of testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were measured before and after 5 days of treatment with hCG (2000 IU/d) in 36 prepubertal boys with cryptorchidism and 11 with hypospadias in order to determine whether a defect in androgen synthesis could be a common cause for these disorders. Baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were similar in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism, monorchism and hypospadias; baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone were lower in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism. Testosterone levels did not correlate with either the anatomical location of the testis in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism or with the site of the urethra in boys with hypospadias. Seven of 36 patients with cryptorchidism had a positive family history of a similar disorder; testosterone levels were similar in patients with and without a family history. It is concluded: 1) in all patients studied, the gonadotropin dependent phase of testosterone production is present; 2) hCG stimulation cannot detect unilateral Leydig cell dysfunction; and 3) in familial cases of cryptorchidism, some factor other than an abnormality in androgen synthesis may be responsible for the hereditary tendency.\n",
      "A rabbit reticulocyte model for the role of hemin-controlled repressor in hypochromic anemias. Hemin allows maximal protein synthesis in intact rabbit reticulocytes and their cell-free lysate preparations by retarding the formation of a translational repressor (HCR) found in the postribosomal supernate. In order to evaluate the role of HCR in the pathogenesis of hypochromic anemias, HCR was isolated and partially purified from intact rabbit reticulocytes incubated in vitro with either 0.1 mM alpha,alpha-dipyridyl (an iron-chelating agent) or 0.1 M ethanol. Both of these agents inhibit reticulocyte protein synthesis. Hemin (50 muM) protects against the inhibition by both agents. A ferrous iron-transferrin mixture, however, protects only against alpha,alpha-dipyridyl. Both alpha,alpha-dipyridyl and ethanol inhibit heme synthesis before the time that protein synthesis is affected, while neither lowers either ATP or GSH levels. These results indicate that while both agents inhibit heme synthesis, alpha,alpha-dipyridyl does so by inducing iron deficiency while ethanol works at a non-iron-requiring step. When HCR was isolated from intact cells and assayed in the reticulocyte cell-free systems, plus and minus hemin, premature appearance of HCR was found in cells incubated in vitro with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl or ethanol. When hemin was present in the intact cell incubation, the appearance of HCR was retarded. The HCR from alpha,alpha-dipyridyl ethanol-treated cells was partially purified and eluted at the same location on a Sephadex G-200 column (molecular weight approximately 3 x 10(5)) as that from postribosomal supernates incubated minus hemin. In addition rabbits with phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia were given intravenous ethanol in vivo at a dose of 0.4 ml/kg. This concentration of alcohol resulted in an inhibition of the rate of heme synthesis and protein synthesis as well as an acceleration of HCR formation in reticulocytes. The HCR from these in vivo treated rabbits was isolated, partially purified, and assayed in an identical fashion as the in vitro experiments. These in vivo experiments further support the physiological and pathophysiological role of HCR in reticulocytes. On the basis of these results a model for a role of HCR in some of the hypochromic anemias is proposed. In iron deficiency or chronic disease (where iron is not available to the erythroblast for heme synthesis) HCR appears prematurely and inhibits protein synthesis. When heme synthesis is inhibited by ethanol but there is sufficient intracellular iron, HCR appears prematurely and inhibits protein synthesis, iron accumulates in the erythroblast, and the end result is sideroblastic anemia.\n",
      "Arylsulfatase B of human lung. Isolation, characterization, and interaction with slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. Arylsulfatase B was separated from arylsulfatase A in extracts of human lung tissue by anion exchange chromatography and further purified by gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography. Arylsulfatase B of human lung was similar to that enzyme in other tissues and species, exhibiting an apparent mol wt of approximately 60,000, a pH optimum for cleavage of 4-nitrocatechol sulfate (pNCS) of 5.5-6.0, and a sensitivity to inhibition by phosphate ions and especially pyrophosphate in the presence of NaCl. Human lung arylsulfatase B inactivated slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxix (SRS-A) in a linear time-dependent reaction in which the rate was determined by the enzyme-to-substrate ratio. Cleavage of pNCS by human lung arylsulfatase B was competitively suppressed by SRS-A. The finding that human lung tissue contains predominately arylsulfatase B discloses a potential regulatory mechanism for inactivation of SRS-A at or near the site of its generation.\n",
      "Credibility ratings for desensitization and pseudotherapy among moderately and mildly snake-avoidant college students. Twenty moderately avoidant and 20 mildly avoidant Ss were chosen as though they were to participate in a snake-avoidance desensitization experiment. After relaxation training, Ss listened to a taped excerpt of either desensitization or pseudotherapy and responded to a 5-item questionnaire that assessed the credibility of the treatment. Mildly avoidant Ss rated desensitization as more credible than pseudotherapy. The implication of this finding is that a great many experimental studies of systematic desensitization have failed to control satisfactorily for the operation of expectancy effects and nonspecific forms of behavioral influence.\n",
      "A comparison of female and male neurotic depressives. Female and male neurotic depressives in an outpatient psychiatric clinic were compared on measures of subjective distress, interpersonal concerns, and types of treatment given. There were essentially no differences between the two groups on the patient self-report measures. However, female patients were found to have significantly more therapy sessions that the male neurotic depressives. Also, the female patients were more likely than the male patients to receive psychotropic medication, especially the more potent antidepressant variety.\n",
      "Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis for the diagnosis of pneumococcal chest infection. Counter-current immunoelectrohporesis is a rapid sensitive method for detecting pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. A result can be obtained within 45 minutes. The optimum conditions for performing the test are given. Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis works with all the 33 pneumococcal antigens tested except type 14. Better precipitin lines are obtained when the gel-support is acid (pH 6-6) than when it is alkaline (pH 8-6). Omniserum is as effective as group-specific sera for the identification of pneumococcal capsular antigens. The findings suggest that pneumococcal infection was present in 44% of 300 unselected suspected chest infections. Culture for pneumococci was positive in only 15% of these cases. The clinical importance of these findings is still being studied but our experience has shown that patients with chest infections should have effective antipneumococcal antibiotics as part of their regimen and that the laboratory diagnosis may be made quickly and accurately by counter-current immunoelectrophoresis.\n",
      "Use of anaerobic culture for the improved isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The following report compares the results of aerobic and anaerobic cultivation for the primary isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) from the respiratory tract of children. Of 414 specimens of respiratory tract secretions cultured, 65 (15-7%) yielded pneumococci; 31 (47-7%) grew both aerobically and anaerobically, but 34 (52-3%) strains were isolated only from the anaerobic culture. Pneumococci cultured anaerobically with added carbon dioxide characteristically produce large mucoid colonies which are more easily distinguished than the 'normal' colonies commonly seen in the mixed flora isolated from respiratory sites. This advantage justifies the inclusion of anaerobic culture when attempting to isolate Str. pneumoniae from clinical material.\n",

Mirror-induced aggressive display of male Siamese fighting fish was reduced by water-borne traces of (a) a pair of male combatants, (b) a nondisplaying fish of either sex, and (c) bits of torn cadual fin. These findings may indicate a mechanism whereby males tolerate the presence of conspecifics to permit nonagressive social interactions.\n",

The initial galactose content of the mix was a trace but increased to 1.20% during fermentation. Glucose content remained a trace throughout fermentation. Several brands of commercial yogurt were purchased from local supermarkets and analyzed for carbohydrate content.

Several mammary and adipose enzymes were measured in normal, adrenal-ectomized, adrenalectomized cortisol-treated, and intake-restricted lactating rats. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, lipoprotein lipase, and triglyceride synthetase complex activities in mammary tissue were unchanged by intake restriction, decreased by adrenalectomy, and increased by glucocorticoid-replacement therapy.

      "B-complex vitamins in cultured and acidified yogurt. Studies were to determine the effect of various factors upon B-vitamin content of cultured yogurt and to compare the B-vitamin contents of cultured and direct acidified yogurt. Incubation of yogurt culture at 42 C for 3 h yielded maximum vitamin synthesis concurrent with optimal flavor and texture qualities. A method was standardized for the manufacture of direct acidified yogurt involving the use of Stabilac acidulant and nonfat dry milk, Carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin, and Starite. Acidified yogurt showed a slightly higher content of certain B-vitamins than the cultured yogurt due to the contribution made by various food additives. Both cultured and acidified yogurt showed good keeping quality and freedom from microbial contaminants during storage at 5 C for 16 days. However, folic acid and vitamin B12 contents decreased 29 and 60% in cultured yogurt and 48 and 54% in acidified yogurt.\n",
      "Microorganisms and characteristics of laban. Laban had a titratable acidity of about 1.0%, a pH of 4.25, an ethanol content of 1.25%, and contained 4.2 mug acetaldehyde and 34 mug acetoin/ml. There was no diacetyl. Five microorganisms, classified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Leuconostoc lactis, Kluyveromyces fragilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were responsible for the fermentation. Streptococcus thermophilus and L. acidophilus were responsible for acid production with S. thermophilus producing acid more rapidly. Most of the acetaldehyde was produced by K. fragilis, little ethanol was found in absence of S. cerevisiae, and the acetoin was producted by S. thermophilus.\n",
      "A mechanism for tobacco smoke-induced allergy. Normal CFW mice, when exposed to tobacco smoke, showed a significantly increased susceptibility to the lethal effects of histamine. The LD50 for mice subjected to smoke was 45 mg/kg of histamine, whereas in normal CFW mice the LD50 was 1,100 mg/kg. The histamine susceptibility of smoked mice was markedly diminished by injecting the animals with isoproterenol. Normal CFW mice, as well as sham control mice, exhibited an epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia, whereas the blood glucose values for smoked mice given epinephrine were essentially the same as those for sham mice given only saline. This observation indicates that tobacco smoke may contain a component which causes an autonomic imbalance, hence rendering the mice more susceptible to histamine. This tobacco smoke-induced allergy is probably related to a blockade of adrenergic receptors and not to an immunologic phenomenon.\n",
      "Regulation of the antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. V. Ontogeny of factors influencing the magnitude of the plaque-forming cell response. Mice of different ages were evaluated with respect to their ability to give a plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSSIII), as well as the degree of amplifier and suppressor thymus-derived(T) cell activity present. Although the magnitude of the PFC response to an optimally immunogenic dose of SSS-III for 2-and 3-week old mice was only 7% and 14%, respectively, of that produced by adult (8-week old) mice, values comparable to those of adult animals were attained by 4 weeks of age; no significant changes in the ability to respond to SSS-III occurred thereafter. Amplifier T cell activity, which was minimal at 2 to 4 weeks of age, matured slowly and did not reach a maximum until 8 to 10 weeks of age. By contrast, suppressor T cell activity appeared to be fully developed at least as early as 2 weeks of age; here, the inhibitory effects produced could by abrogated by depletion of T cells, indicating that the unresponsiveneness induced by such cells does not result in the depletion ot irreversible inactivation of B cells capable of responding to SSS-III. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of suppressor T cells are predominant in young mice and that such cells may play an important role in determining the ease with which unresponsiveness is induced in neonates, and in the prevention of autoimmune disease. Also, studies conducted with adult-thymectomized mice showed that both amplifier and suppressor T cells, once seeded to the periphery, are stable and do not depend upon the presence of intact thymus for the expression or renewal of their activity.\n",
      "The role of the capsular polysaccharide in the activation of the alternative pathway by the pneumococcus. Previous studies have shown that when pneumococci are incubated in normal, nonimmune serum, they activate the alternative pathway and opsonically active C3b is fixed to the surface of the organism. Other studies have demonstrated that C3-dependent opsonization via the alternative pathway plays a significant role in the nonimmune host's defense against the pneumococcus. The present studies concern the role of the capsular polysaccharide in initiating the activation of the alternative pathway by the pneumococcus. Some pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide types, but not all, are able to activate the alternative pathway. Soluble purified capsular polysaccharide types 1, 4 and 25 activate the alternative pathway, whereas types 2, 3, 14, and 19 do not. Since the capsular polysaccharides exist in their native form attached to the pneumococcal surface, selected capsular polysaccharides were also tested for their ability to activate the alternative pathway when attached to a particulate carrier, sheep erythrocytes. Capsular polysaccharide types 2 and 3 failed to activate the alternative pathway when attached to sheep erythrocytes, paralleling the results obtained when these capsular polysaccharides were in solution. In contrast, the type 25 capsular polysaccharide not only activated the alternative pathway when attached to sheep erythrocytes, as it had when in solution, but it also initiated alternative pathway-mediated lysis of the erythrocytes. The capsular polysaccharide is not required for the activation of the alternative pathway by the pneumococcus. Although all types of encapsulated pneumococci are able to activate the alternative pathway, not all the purified capsular polysaccharide types are able to do so. In addition, a nonencapsulated pneumococcus, derived originally from a type 2 organism, activates the alternative pathway as well as a fully encapsulated type 2 pneumococcus.\n",
      "The effects of age on the immune response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SIII) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in BALB/c, SJL/J, and C3H mice. Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SIII) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to evaluate B cell and T cell regulatory functions in BALB/c, SJL/J, and C3H mice of various ages. It was found that the BALB/c and C3H mice could mount high level plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses to SIII at various ages through 110 weeks whereas the levels of the SJL/J PFC responses had begun to decline by the age of 42 weeks through the age of 80 weeks. BALB/c mice were also capable of producing strong PFC responses to LPS at various ages through 110 weeks whereas the comparable SJL/J PFC responses to LPS had declined by 80 weeks of age. By using anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) and low-dose paralysis to SIII, it was shown that suppressor T cell activity was apparently greater in young BALB/c mice than in older BALB/c mice. It was also found that paralysis to SIII in BALB/c mice was easier to achieve at an early age. SJL/J mice were found to have the necessary B cell activity to respond to SIII through 80 weeks of age and the PFC responses could be greatly enhanced by ALS. Implications of the roles of regulatory T cells in aging are discussed.\n",
      "Production of IgG antibodies and enhanced response of nude mice to DNP-AE-dextran. DNP-AE-dextran, prepared by the binding of DNP-epsilon-aminocaproyl residues to animoethylated dextran (predominantly alpha-1,6-linked), induced a T-independent anti-DNP antibody response in mice. However, certain differences were observed between the response to this antigen in normal andnude mice. Thus, the antibody titers of nu/nu mice from day 10 to 38 after immunization were significantly higher than those of nu/+ controls. Furthermore, DNP-AE-dextran induced a weak secondary response in nu/+ but not in nu/nu mice. For both thymusless and normal mice the production of IgG in addition to IgM antibodies to DNP-AE-dextran could be established. The former included antibodies of the IgG1 subclass which were considered to be particularly thymus dependent (1). The higher response of nu/nu mice was reflected mainly in the increased production of IgG antibodies. Under the influence of a graft-vs-host reaction, a 10-fold increase in antibody titers to DNP-AE-dextran was observed, due entirely to an enhanced IgG response.\n",
      "Lymphoid cell fractionation by aggregated immunoglobulin-agarose columns. Fractionation by columns of aggregated rat immunoglobulin (Agg Ig)-agarose was investigated as a method of separating different populations of lymphoid cells. With rat spleen cells, Agg Ig columns retained phagocytes, IgM- and IgG-antibody-forming-cells, cells mediating antibody- or PHA-induced lysis of chicken erythrocytes, and specifically immune splenocytes lytic to chicken erythrocytes without exogenous antibody. Agg Ig columns did not selectively remove 'B lymphocytes' (surface-Ig-bearing lymphocytes with or without EAC' receptors), or T lymphocytes capable of PHA-induced proliferation or graft-versus-host reactivity. With mouse spleen cells, Agg Ig columns retained alloimmune cytotoxic T cells.\n",
      "Rheological studies of Hb SS blood: influence of hematocrit, hypertonicity, separation of cells, deoxygenation, and mixture with normal cells. Studies of the rheological properties of Hb SS blood indicate that the marked increase in viscosity with deoxygenation is primarily due to cell-cell interaction of cells which were not permanently deformed. The permanently deformed cells, the bottom fraction of cells separated by centrifugation, show only a fraction of the increase in viscosity compared to top cells, when each was deoxygenated. Top cells showed a greater degree of morphologic change with deoxygenation compared to bottom cells. The viscosity of deoxygenated Hb SS blood was disproportionately reduced by the addition of compatible deoxygenated Hb AA cells. A mixture of 1/4 Hb AA cells and 3/4 Hb SS cells reduced the viscosity of deoxygenated Hb SS blood 50 per cent. Studies of Hb SS cells in hypertonic media indicate that hypertonicity per se does not cause sickling. Normal and Hb SS erythrocytes both show identical changes in rheological properties when suspended in hypertonic serum. However, changes in oxygen saturation due to a decrease in intracellular pH with certain hypertonic media may lead to sickling when Hb SS blood is at intermediate PO2 levels. The addition of x-ray contrast material to blood results in the changes due to hypertonicity but does not cause sickling of Hb SS cells. The contrast material lowers the pH of the media and raises intracellular pH.\n",
      "Detection of pneumococcal polysaccharide in the sputum of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia by counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Each of 41 patients with bacterial pneumonia was placed into 1 of 4 categories based on the relative clinical certainty of the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. The frequency of pneumococcal polysaccharide in the sputum by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) was then noted for each diagnostic category of patients. Detection of pneumococcal polysaccharide in sputum correlated with the diagnostic certainty of pneumococcal pneumonia, while results of culture of sputum were less indicative of pneumococcal infection. Saliva of 83 normal individuals failed to give positive tests for pneumococcal polysaccharide despite the presence of alpha-hemolytic streptococci on culture. Furthermore, the mere presence of pneumococci in cultures did not predict a positive test for polysaccharide by CIE nor did the absence of pneumococci mean that polysaccharide would not be detected. This study suggests that detection of pneumococcal polysaccharide appears more rapid, more sensitive, and more specific than sputum cultures in diagnosing pneumococcal infection of the lung.\n",
      "The myofilament lattice: studies on isolated fibers. IV. Lattice equilibria in striated muscle. Accounts of similarities between the thick filament lattice of striated muscle and smectic liquid-crystalline structures have focused upon an equilibrium between electrostatic (repulsive) and van der Waal's (attractive) forces. In living, intact muscle the fiber volume constitutes an additional important parameter which influences the amount of interaxial separation between the filaments. This is demonstrable by comparison of the lattice behavior of living fibers with that of fibers from which the sarcolemma has either been removed or made leaky by glycerination. These comparisons were made mainly by low-angle X-ray diffraction under conditions of changes in sarcomere length, ionic strength or osmolarity, and pH. Single fibers with the sarcolemma removed and glycerinated muscle have lattices which behave in accord with equilibrium liquid-crystalline systems in which the thick filament spacing is determined by the balance between electrostatic and van der Waal's forces. Conversely, osmotic and shortening studies demonstrate that the living, intact muscle has a lattice which behaves in accord with the so-called non-equilibrium (volume-constrained) liquid-crystalline condition in which the interaxial separation between the thick filaments is solely due to the amount of volume available as determined by the Donnan steady-state across the sarcolemma.\n",
      "The identification and subcellular localization of thrombosthenin \"M\", the myosin-like component of pig platelets. A protein has been studied which spontaneously precipitates from stored fractions of platelet soluble phase prepared by density gradient centrifugation. It is rich in a Ca2+ ATPase activity which displays an activity/pH profile resembling that of skeletal muscle myosin. Adjustment of freshly prepared soluble phase fractions to 0.6 M with respect to KCl and dilution 1 in 3 results in the precipitations of a protein fraction with essentially the same enzymatic properties as the spontaneously precipitable protein. These two similar proteins represent between 9 and 13% of the soluble phase total protein and each account for almost the whole of divalent cation activated ATPase activity of the soluble phases from which they were derived. The Mg2+ ATPase activity is only about twice purified with respect to the soluble phase enzyme activity, but the Ca2+ ATPase shows a 10-13-fold enrichment. Synthetic actomyosins can be prepared from the two proteins by addition of either platelet or skeletal muscle actin. These show significant increases in Mg2+ ATPase at the most favourable combination ratios. The ratio between the yield of soluble phase protein obtained by dilution precipitation and the lactate dehydrogenase activity of the soluble phase remains constant under a wide range of homogenization and sonication conditions applied to the original whole platelet suspensions. This confirms our earlier view that the soluble phase is a valid intracellular compartment for a considerable proportion of the platelet contractile protein and that in the complex the myosin-like component predominates.\n",
      "Control of mouth opening and pharynx protrusion during feeding in the sea anemone Calliactis parasitica. 1. Activity in all three known conducting systems (the nerve net, SS1, and SS2) may accompany feeding in Calliactis. The most marked response is an increase in pulse frequency in the SS2 (the endodermal slow conducting system) during mouth opening and pharynx protrusion. 2. Electrical stimulation of the SS2 at a frequency of one shock every 5 s elicits mouth opening and pharynx protrusion in the absence of food. 3. A rise in SS2 pulse frequency is also evoked by food extracts, some amino acids, and in particular by the tripeptide reduced glutathione, which produces a response at a concentration of 10(-5) M. 4. Although the SS2 is an endodermal system, the receptors involved in the response to food appear to be ectodermal. 5. The epithelium that lines the pharynx conducts SS1 pulses, but there is some evidence for polarization of conduction.\n",
      "Blood oxygen transport and metabolism of the confined lugworm Arenicola marina (L.). Oxygen consumption (MO2), haemoglobin oxygen saturation level (SVO2) and pH (pHv) in prebranchial blood were measured in lugworms experimentally confined in sea water at 15 degrees C. Total blood flow through the gills (Vb) was estimated. For sea water oxygen partial pressure (PwO2) between 120 and 150 Torr MO2, SVO2 and Vb were high and nearly constant. For PwO2 less than 120 Torr, Vb fell quickly, MO2 progressively dropped, and metabolism remained aerobic at the expense of the prebrancial blood oxygen store. For PwO2 less than 50 Torr, Vb and SvO2 values were extremely low, and the low pHv and the modified buffer power of the surrounding sea water showed that anaerobic metabolism was occurring. Changes in respiratory gas exchanges and metabolism during the tidal cycle are deduced from the comparison of these results with data obtained in the field.\n",
      "Multiple sedimenting species of properdin in human serum and interaction of purified properdin with the third component of complement. Normal human serum subjected to sucrose density gradient analysis exhibited multiple sedimenting species of properdin antigen. Properdin antigen distribution was dependent on serum concentration, ionic strength, temperature, and the presence of C3, and was not dependent on the presence of divalent metal cations or blood coagulation. In mixtures of purified components, properdin sedimented heavier in the presence of C3, C3b, or C3c. Addition of factor B to mixtures containing C3 and properdin was without effect. These data provide insights into earlier discrepancies concerning the sedimentation behavior of partially purified properdin, indicate a propensity of some constituents of the alternative pathway to form protein-protein complexes, and suggest caution in interpretation of immunopathological studies in which properdin deposits are found in the presence of C3.\n",
      "[Cathepsin, phosphoprotein-phosphatase and acid phosphatase in the soluble fraction of the cattle brain cortex: purification and properties (author's transl)]. Cattle brain cortex was homogenised in 0, 29 mol/1 sucrose and centrifuged at 101 000 X g. The supernatant contains the majority of 3 enzymes participating in protein turnover: cathepsin (EC 3.4.4.23), phosphoprotein phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16) and acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2). They were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G 200 in neutral buffer. The cathepsin was purified up to 380 fold by gel filtration on Sephadex and column electrophoresis. The pH optimum of cathepsin was 5.7. At 37 degrees C no decrease of activity was measurable during 30 min. The Km was found to be 2.75 mg/ml Casein Hammarsten. The molecular weight by gel filtration and exclusion-gel electrophoresis was about 45 000, corresponding to the cathepsin from human liver (Barrett, A.J. (1970) Biochem. J. 117, 601-607). The sedimentation constant 3.0 S20,W is comparable with the values of proteinase of different origin, and the composition is similar with respect to the high proportion of acidic amino acids. The phosphoprotein phosphatase can be further purified by chromatography on hydroxyapatite and by column electrophoresis. The pH optimum of phosphoprotein phosphatase was about pH 5.5. At 45 degrees C no decrease of activity was measurable during 20 min; the Km was 1.43 mg/ml casein isoelectric. The pH optimum of acid phosphatase was about 5.6. At 54 degrees C NO DECREASE OF ACTIVITY WAs measurable during 30 min; the Km was 2 mumol/1 for Sodium phenolphthalein diphosphate. All three enzymes slowly lost their activity during several weeks at - 4 degrees C, apparently by self digestion in the cold.\n",
      "Polydipsia, hyponatremia, and seizures in psychotic patients. Case histories are presented for four psychotic patients who ingested large quantities of water and subsequently developed grand mal seizures and serum sodium levels of less than 121 meq/liter.

      "Isolation from bovine brain of a fraction containing capillaries and a fraction containing membrane fragments of the choroid plexus. Combined differential and density gradient centrifugation was used for the isolation of a capillary-rich fraction from the cerebral cortex and a brush border containing fraction from the bovine choroid plexus. The activities of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and several other marker enzymes were monitored during the fractionation procedure. Electron microscopic examination showed a membrane-rich fraction in the choroid plexus high in the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and 5'-nucleotidase activities. From the brain cortex, a capillary-rich fraction was obtained which was high in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase activities. A histochemical examination showed gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity localized in the capillary walls.\n",
      "Ionic mechanism of 5-hydroxytryptamine induced hyperpolarization and inhibitory junctional potential in body wall muscle cells of Hirudo medicinalis. Five-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) causes a hyperpolarization and increased conductance of the leech body wall muscle cell membrane. If 5-HT is applied in the absence of the Cl minus ion, the response appears as a depolarization, whereas if 5-HT is applied in the absence of the K+ ion, the response is a hyperpolarization. In both cases, the conductance of the muscle cell membrane is increased. Stimulation of the peripheral nerve to the body wall muscle produces a complex junctional potential in muscle cells. Exposing the muscle to d-tubocurarine (d-TC) eliminates the excitatory component (EJP) of the complex potential. The inhibitory potential (IJP) that remains has an equilibrium potential at approximately 65 mV. Furthermore, this IJP appears as a depolarization when the nerve is stimulated in the presence of d-TC and low CL minus, whereas this is not the case if the nerve is stimulated in the presence of d-TC and low K+. The drugs BOL-148 and cyproheptadine block the IJP's in the body wall muscle. These data are interpreted as indicating that 5-HT acts on leech body wall muscle cells by increasing the conductance to the Cl minus ion and that the IJP's caused by nerve stimulation are probably the result of 5-HT release at nerve terminals. As a final point, it has been shown that the inhibition by 5-HT of the spontaneous EJP's that occur on the leech body wall muscle results from an inhibition of central neurons and not from any direct effect on the muscle cell or on peripheral synapses.\n",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratios in hydrocephalus. Cerebral metabolism in 21 hydrocephalic patients was studied. Preoperative and postoperative specimens of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained and the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated in each instance. The specimens of CSF were analyzed for lactate and pyruvate and the lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio was calculated for each sample. The L/P ratio, which reflects the redox state of the cell, was used to determine the extent of anaerobic metabolism. An inverse relationship was noted between CPP and lactate as well as the L/P ratio. In general, the level of anaerobic metabolism was decreased after insertion of a shunt.\n",
      "Effects of hyperventilation, CO2, and CSF pressure on internal carotid blood flow in the baboon. The combined effect upon cerebral blood flow (CBF) of an elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) and changes in respiratory CO2 was studied in nine baboons under chloralose anesthesia. The animals were mildly hyperventilated and provided with increasing amounts of CO2 in O2-air. Arterial CO2 tensions (PaCO2) increased from 17 to 58 mm Hg. Internal carotid blood flow (ICBF) was measured at normal CSFP and at hydrostatically maintained 50 mm Hg CSFP. It was found that: 1) end-tidal CO2 may be used as a substitute for arterial PaCO2 determinations; 2) this elevation of CSFP has little effect on ICBF during hypercapnia and normocapnia; however, 3) during hypocapnia the ICBF is reduced an additional 20% when CSFP is elevated; that is, ICBF is reduced 50% from normal when end-tidal CO2 is reduced to 2% at this elevated level of CSFP. Caution should be exercised during hyperventilation therapy particularly if the elevated CSFP or intracranial pressure (ICP) is not reduced to approach normal levels; in these conditions, the combination of decreasing PaCO2 and elevated ICP may reduce CBF below critical levels and thus lead to cerebral hypoxia.\n",
      "The effect of dietary vanadium on fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and turnover in the chick. Day-old male, broiler type chicks were used to study the effect of 100 ppm dietary vanadium on fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and turnover in vivo. After feeding the experimental diets for 4 weeks body weight and liver weight of chicks fed 100 ppm vanadium were significantly less than those of the control chicks and liver total lipid and cholesterol tended to be slightly higher than the levels of the control chicks. [1-14C] Acetate was administered intravenously and the specific activities of plasma and liver total lipid, cholesterol and fatty acid were determined at 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 15.0 hours after the injection. Plasma total lipid and cholesterol were significantly higher than the levels in the control chicks. The rate of incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into plasma and liver total lipid, cholesterol and fatty acid was higher in chicks fed vanadium than the control group at any of the time being tested after the injection. There was a significant increase in the hepatic citrate cleavage enzyme activity among chicks fed 100 ppm vanadium, whereas, there was no significant change in acetate thiokinase activity. Turnover rate of plasma total lipid and fatty acid in vanadium fed chicks was lower than the control. The turnover rate of plasma cholesterol determined by administering [4-14C]cholesterol and periodically measuring the specific activity of plasma cholesterol was higher in chicks fed vanadium than in those fed the basal diet.\n",
      "Changes of pH-values during storage of fetal blood samples. In recent years increased attention has been given to the degree of acidity of fetal blood during the course of labor or immediately after delivery. As it is not always possible to measure the blood pH immediately after sampling, it is important to know whether or not the pH is likely to change if the blood sample is stored for some time. 30 heparinized whole blood samples were collected from the umbilical artery of 30 newborn infants immediately after delivery and were stored at room temperature. pH -measurements were made every 5 minutes up to 80 minutes. In a second group the same number of samples were stored in a refrigator. pH-measurements were performed after 30 minutes and then every hour for up to 7 hours, and finally after 24 hours. The pHact-values did not change at room temperature (about 24 degrees C) for up to 25 minutes; pHqu40-values decreased initially more rapidly  but at 50 minutes the decrease was the same as in pHact-values namely 0.02 units. Afterwards the pHact-values decreased at a mena rate of about 0.03 units per hour and pHqu40-values at a mean rate of about 0.017 units per hour. If the storage temperature was lowered by refrigeration (about 6 degrees C) the pHact-values remained between 0 and -0.02 units for 6 hours and pHqu40-values for 3 hours. From these experiments it can be concluded that fetal blood samples must be kept in a refrigerator in order to inhibit autoxidation, if they have to be stored for longer than 50 minutes.\n",
      "Inhibition of drug-induced anorexia in rats by methysergide. Iproniazid was found to reduce food consumption in fasting rats. Combined treatment of iproniazid with tryptophan resulted in a significantly greater anorexic action whilst tryptophan alone had no effect on food consumption. Iproniazid treatment was associated with a significant increase in brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration but in association with tryptophan higher brain 5-HT concentrations were recorded. The anorexic action of the iproniazid-tryptophan combination was antagonized in a dose-dependent fashion by methysergide. Equivalent levels of anorexia induced by fenfluramine and mazindol were similarly antagonized by methysergide in a dose-related manner. The results suggest a common role of 5-HT in the inhibition of eating behaviour in fasting rats when anorexia is induced by iproniazid, fenfluramine or mazindol, sensitive to a specific 5-HT antagonist.\n",
      "Cerebral monoamine metabolism in guinea-pigs with ascorbic acid deficiency. Guinea-pigs kept on a diet deficient in vitamin C showed, after 3 weeks, a marked decrease of ascorbic acid in brain and blood leucocytes as well as of the activity of alkaline phosphatase in blood plasma. Pair-fed animals did not exhibit these changes. The alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha MpT)-induced diminution of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus and the rest of the brain was attenuated in pair-fed animals, but restored in guinea-pigs deficient in ascorbic acid. The cerebral noradrenaline content (without administration of alpha MpT) showed a decrease in both pair-fed and ascorbic acid deficient animals. The noradrenaline of the heart exhibited a similar tendency. The alpha MpT-induced dopamine decrease in the striatum of ascorbic acid deficient animals was attenuated and the dopamine content (without alpha MpT administration) decreased. Pair-fed animals showed a similar tendency. The striatal concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) was diminished in both pair-fed and ascorbic acid deficient guinea-pigs. The cerebral content of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid showed a decrease in pair-fed as well as in ascorbic acid deficient animals. It is concluded that ascorbic acid deficiency enhances the turnover of brain noradrenaline, whereas under-nutrition without ascorbic acid deficiency (pair-feeding) diminishes the turnover of cerebral noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine and striatal dopamine.\n",
      "The effect of an aldosterone antagonist on the protective action of carbenoxolone on the gastric mucosal barrier. The effect of an aldosterone antagonist on the protective action of carbenoxolone sodium on the gastric mucosal barrier has been studied in three dogs with Heidenhain pouches. The net fluxes of hydrogen ion and sodium ion were measured before, during, and after contact with a 10 mM bile acid solution at pH 2, in pouches which had not been treated with drugs, in pouches treated with carbenoxolone sodium and in pouches treated with both carbenoxolone sodium and the aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone. Hydrogen ion back diffusion from, and sodium ion gain by the untreated pouch was increased by 10 mM bile acid solution. Addition to the pouches of either carbenoxolone sodium alone or carbenoxolone sodium and spironolactone reduced the hydrogen ion back diffusion after exposure to the bile acid solution. The spironolactone did not change the protective effect of carbenoxolone on the gastric mucosal barrier. Carbenoxolone did not change the increased sodium ion diffusion caused by bile.\n",
      "The quantification of kanamycin ototoxicity in the rat using conditioned tone discrimination. Twelve male Lister hooded rats were conditioned to discriminate an 8 kHz tone (56.5 +/- 0.5 dB re 0.0002 dyne cm-2) and were subsequently injected subcutaneously with kanamycin (400 mg kg-1 day-1) for 28 days; during this time and for five weeks after dosage was stopped, the nature and extent of the resultant hearing deficits were studied. The animals' Preyer reflex thresholds were determined at intervals during the study. Only one rat was unaffected by the kanamycin dosage. The onset of hearing impairment (reduced discrimination performance), which was gradual in some rats and sudden in others, generally occurred during the fourth week of kanamycin dosage although the earliest onset was towards the end of the second week. In most animals the hearing impairment progressed after kanamycin was stopped and in one rat there was a latency between the end of drug dosage and onset of hearing impairment. Hearing impairment was irreversible in five rats. One rat, whose impairment was slight, recovered normal hearing. Some rats showed a reduced discrimination performance at a time when their Preyer reflex threshold showed no elevation suggesting that kanamycin, at least initially, caused a threshold elevation rather than reduced sensitivity to intense sounds.\n",
      "The bioavailability in man of ICRF-159 a new oral antineoplastic agent. The bioavailability of the antineoplastic agent, ICRF-159, has been examined in 12 patients receiving the drug in single and subdivided dose schedules in an attempt to account for the differences in toxicity found with the different schedules clinically. Recovery of radioactivity in the urine after single large doses (13.3-19.4 g) was 8.5 +/- 3.0% of the administered dose. After doses of 3.8-5.55 g recovery was 22.7 +/- 10.5% and after the same dose subdivided into 3 equal aliquots it was 52 +/- 8.7%. Unrecovered radioactivity was largely accounted for in the faeces. Plasma radioactivity levels in 2 patients after high and low dose were equivalent. Toxicity of the drug paralleled urinary recovery of radioactivity. It is concluded that schedule dependence of toxicity of ICRF-159 is at least partly due to bioavailability factors.\n",

      "The identification and analysis of the metabolic products of mephentermine. Phentermine (Ib), N-hydroxymephentermine (Ic) and N-hydroxyphentermine (Id) were identified as metabolic products after in vitro incubation of mephentermine (Ia) with rabbit liver microsomal fractions. Compounds Ia, Ib and Ic were also identified as excretion products in the urine of a human subject given a single dose of mephentermine (Ia) sulphate. Derivatization with acetic anhydride, trifluoroacetic anhydride and the trimethylsilyl donor reagent N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) or hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) were used for qualitative identification of the metabolic products Ib-Id by g.l.c.-mass spectrometry and for quantitative determination of Ia-Id after extraction from rabbit hepatic homogenates. The synthesis of N-hydroxymephentermine (Ic) and the properties of the metabolic products are reported.\n",
      "A rapid g.l.c. procedure for the determination of codeine and norcodeine in biological fluids based on micro-phase extraction techniques. Therapeutic serum concentrations of codeine can be virtually completely extracted and obtained sufficiently concentrated for g.c. measurement without distillation, by acid extraction of the drug from the initial crude organic extracts of alkalinized serum followed by a micro-phase back extraction step. The procedure has simplicity, rapidity and eliminates concentration by distillation and background interference. The method can be readily adapted for the seperate measurements of codeine and norcodeine and it can also be used for similar analysis of other body fluids.\n",
      "Plasma sodium concentration and sodium excretion in the anaesthetized dog. 1. The effect of acute alterations of plasma sodium concentration (PNa) on renal sodium excretion (UNaV) was investigated by three types of experiments on anaesthetized dogs: (a) A local increase in PNa at one kidney was produced by infusion of hypertonic saline directly into its artery while systemic levels of PNa were stabilized by haemodialysis. (b) Systemic levels of PNa were lowered by exchange transfusion of blood for an equal volume of salt-free dextran-in-dextrose solution. The results were contrasted with those observed after similar exchanges, but using dextran-in-saline solution. (c) The level of PNa was altered by varying the sodium concentration of a saline solution infused at a fixed rate either intravenously or into one renal artery. 2. All three types of experiment suggest a dependence of UNaV on PNa Analysis demonstrated that this relationship was not due to contemporary changes in: packed cell volume; plasma solids concentration; plasma potassium concentration; blood pressure or plasma hydrogen ion concentration. The distribution of these variables did not change with PNa except for plasma hydrogen ion concentration. Moreover, the relationship persisted when data were selected to exclude clearance periods in which the value for any variable had shifted past the group mean obtained before PNa was altered. 3. The fall in UNaV at low levels of PNa could be attributed to a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but the progressive rise in UNaV seen as PNa exceeded 150 m-mole 1(-1) occurred despite a fall in GFR and no apparent change in the mean filtered load of sodium. These results suggest that the increased sodium excretion accompanying raised levels of PNa is due to reduced tubular re-absorption of sodium.\n",
      "Synthesis of angiotensin II antagonists containing N- and O-methylated and other amino acid residues.

They caused an initial rise in blood pressure (30 min of infusion, 250 ng/kg/min in vagotomized, ganglion-blocked rats) of 16.57, 9.80, 22.80, 32.00, 7.00, 15.06, 32.50, and 11.42 mmHg and showed secretory activity (isolated cat adrenal medulla) of 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.1, less than 0.01, 0.1, less than 0.01, and 0.05% of angiotensin II. On isolated organs pA2 values (rabbit aortic strips) of 8.74, 7.44, 7.64, 7.85, 7.89, 8.76, 8.63, and 8.08, and pA2 values (cat adrenal medulla of 8.16, 9.16, 9.31, 8.00, 8.00, 7.00, 9.16, and 9.33 were obtained. Dose ratios (ratio of ED20 of angiotensin II during infusion of the antagonist and before infusion of the antagonist) in vagotomized, ganglion-blocked rats, infused at 250 ng/kg/min, were 33.43, 2.14, 3.26, 2.99, 0.62, 62.52, incalculable, and 11.15, respectively. The results obtained suggest that (a) analogs I and VI are potent antagonists of the pressor response of angiotensin II in normal rat, VI being the most potent antagonist thus far synthesized; (b) replacement of position 4 (Tyr) with MeTyr or position 5 and/or 8 (Ile) with Melle in [1-sarcosine,8-isoleucine]angiotensin II reduced the antagonist activity of this peptide (rabbit aortic strips and rats), indicating that steric hindrance imposed due to N-methylation in positions 4, 5, or 8 was not favorable in eliminating the initial pressor activity or prolonging the duration of action of [Sar1, Ile8]angiotensin II without reducing its antagonistic properties; (c) except II, none of the analogs showed any enhanced duration of action, suggesting that N-methylation in positions 5 or 8 did not afford protection against proteolytic enzymes; and (d) perfusion studies in cat adrenals indicated that all of these analogs are only very weak secretagogues. With the exception of [Sar1,Thr(ObetaMe)8]angiotensin II, which gave lower antagonistic properties, all other analogs had either similar antagonistic properties or were better antagonists in adrenal medulla than in smooth muscle.\n",
      "Synthesis and enzymic activity of some novel xanthine oxidase inhibitors. 3-Substituted 5,7-dihydroxypyrazolo(1,5-alpha)pyrimidines. A series of 3-substituted 5,7-dihydroxypyrazolo[1,5-alpha]pyrimidines containing various aromatic [phenyl- (3e), 3-pyridyl- (3f), p-bromophenyl- (3g), p-chlorophenyl- (3h), p-acetamidophenyl- (3i), p-tolyl- (3j), m-tolyl- (3k), 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl- (3m), or naphthyl- (3n)] or nonaromatic [hydrogen- (3a), nitro- (3b), bromo- (3c), or chloro- (3d)] substituents in the 3 position was synthesized and tested as inhibitors of xanthine oxidase. The compounds (3a-m) were synthesized by condensation of the appropriate 3-amino-4-substituted pyrazole with diethyl malonate in alcoholic sodium methoxide and neutralization of the resulting enol sodium salts. As inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, 3e-n greater than 3a,c,d congruent to allopurinol greater than 3b. The 3-aryl-substituted compounds 3e-n were 30-160 times better xanthine oxidase inhibitors than allopurinol using hypoxanthine as substrate and 10-80 times better using xanthine as substrate, as evidenced by a comparison of Ki values. The inhibition by all compounds (3a-n) was totally reversible and of the noncompetitive or mixed type. A study of the pH dependence of xanthine oxidase inhibition by 3a,e,g and allopurinol indicated that the 3-aryl substituents facilitated binding to the enzyme. These and the above results show that the compounds reported here inhibit xanthine oxidase by a mechanism which is significantly different from that of allopurinol.\n",
      "Immobilized glucuronosyltransferase for the synthesis of conjugates. Partially purified rabbit liver UDPglucuronosyltransferase is immobilized on agarose by the cyanogen bromide activation method. Both soluble and matrix-bound enzyme preparations display very similar Km and pH optimum. The storage stability of the immobilized enzyme at 4 degrees is 5-10 times improved over the soluble preparations. The agarose-bound UDPglucuronosyltransferase is successfully used in the synthesis of p-nitrophenyl glucuronide in an overall yield of 50-70%. The matrix-bound enzyme is reusable over an extended period of time and offers an easy and convenient synthetic tool for various drug glucuronides.\n",
      "The limits of informed consent. The patient, a 59-year-old man, was referred to a psychiatric hospital with what appeared initially to be the signs and symptoms of mental disorder. In hospital a lesion of the brain was diagnosed and surgery was proposed to relieve the condition. The patient, however, during this and subsequent admissions to hospital, refused operation. His refusal to consent was regarded as valid as he seemed to have good insight into his condition. Finally, under section 26 of the Mental Health Act, he was treated surgically. Unfortunately the patient died six weeks later of intracranial haemorrhage. Three comments are made on this case - two by psychiatrists, Dr K Davison and Dr Ashley Robin, the other by a professor of Christian ethics, Professor F C Blackie. Both psychiatrists argue that when a patient's mind is affected by mental or organic illness to the degree that 'he cannot bring a rational and conscious mind' to the question of his treatment then the doctor, in consultation with the relatives, making clear to them the likely course of events if an operation is not performed, must take whatever is the proper course of action, in this case surgery. In this view, such an operation performed immediately the diagnosis was confirmed might not have been so complicated. Professor Blackie, commending 'the attempt to regard the patient as a responsible human being' with a 'moral right to be consulted on all aspects of treatment', questions in this patient the limits to which the appeal to reason was carried. He concludes that 'in this situation the advice and consent of the family must weigh more heavily than the statements of the patient'.\n",
      "Calcium-potassium-stimulated net potassium efflux from human erythrocyte ghosts. In the presence of 8 mM external Ca++, the K+ permeability of human red cell ghosts increases provided K+ is also present in the medium. This increase does not represent K+/K+ exchange but a stimulation of net K+ efflux. The stimulation is half-maximal at 0.7 +/- 0.15 mM (n=5). At concentrations above 4.0 mM, external K+ inhibits net K+ efflux. Similar stimulatory and inhibitory effects of external K were also observed in intact cells after exposure to Pb++ or to Ca++ in the presence of fluoride, iodoacetate plus adenosine, or propranolol, suggesting that a common K+ -activated K+ -specific transfer system may be involved under all of these various circumstances. Internal K+ also stimulates net K+ efflux from ghosts, but it is uncertain whether internal K+ is an absolute requirement for the K+ permeability increase. In contrast to external Na+ which slightly stimulates K+ efflux, internal Na+ inhibits. The inhibition by internal Na+ is abolished by sufficiently high concentrations of external K+, showing that K+ binding to the outer membrane surface and Na+ binding to the internal surface are mutually interdependent. In red cell ghosts the Ca++ -K+ -stimulated net K+ efflux increases with increasing pH until a plateau is reached between pH 7.2 and 8.0. In fluoride-poisoned intact cells, the Ca++-K+ stimulated flux passes through a maximum around pH 6.8. Neither internal nor external Mg++ interferes with the combined effects of Ca++ and K+. Similarly, external EDTA has no influence at concentrations which are far lower than the Ca++ concentration required to produce a maximal response. In contrast, low concentrations of internal EDTA prevent the permeability change.\n",
      "Analog circuit of the Acetabularia membrane. The high membrane potential of Acetabularia (Em=-170mV) is due to an electrogenic pump in parallel with the passive diffusion system (Ed=-80mV) which could be studied separately in the cold, when the pump is blocked. Electrical measurements under normal conditions show that the pump pathway consists of its electromotive force Ep with two elements P1 and P2 in series; P2 is shunted by a large capacitance (Cp=3mF cm-2). The nonlinear current-voltage relationship of P1 (light- and temperature-sensitive) could be determined separately; it reflects the properties of a carrier-mediated electrogenic pump. The value of Ep(-190 mV) indicates a stoichiometry of 2:1 between electrogenically transported charges and ATP. The electrical energy normally stored in Cp, compares well with the metabolic energy, stored in the ATP pool. The nonlinear current-voltage relationship of P2 (attributed to phosphorylating reactions) is also sensitive to light and temperature and is responsible for the region of negative conductance of the overall current-voltage relationship. The power of the pump (1 muW cm-2) amounts to some percent of the total energy turnover. The high Cl- fluxes (1 nmol cm-2 sec-1) and the electrical properties of the plasmalemma are not as closely related as assumed previously. For kinetic reasons, a direct and specific Cl- pathway between the vacuole and outside is postulated to exist.\n",
      "Nigericin-induced charge transfer across membranes. The electric properties of the bilayer lecithin membranes have been studied in the presence of the antibiotic nigericin. When the antibiotic concentration is about 10(-7) ohm-1 cm-2. The potassium ion concentration gradient gives rise to a transmembrane potential of the order of 40 mV per 10-fold concentration gradient with the side of the higher potassium concentration negative. The transmembrane potential produced by the hydrogen ion concentration gradient is a function of the potassium ion concentration which is equal on both sides of the membrane. For low potassium ion concentrations the hydrogen potential has the expected polarity with the solution having higher concentration of protons negative. For potassium ion concentrations exceeding 0.03 M the hydrogen potential has the reverse polarity. This unexpected result cannot be accounted for in terms of the available simple hypotheses about the charge transport mechanism for nigericin in BLM. In order to account for the experimental results obtained, a theoretical approach has been developed based on the assumption that charge is transported across the membrane by nigericin dimers. The theoretical predicitons are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. The model also yields some predictions which may be verified in future experiments.\n",

      "[Diagnosis and therapy of primary defects of immunity (author's transl)]. Immunological responses are divided into those mediated by humoral antibody (B-Cells) and those by cells (T-Cells). Both depend upon the activity of small lymphocytes which become thymus or bursa analogue dependent during embryonic development. Primary immundeficiencies are therefor defects of lymphocytes attributed in most cases to gene defects. Early diagnosis is the necessary prerequisit for possible treatment. Tests for assessing the cellular immune status are: skin testes and in vitro tests. Clinical syndroms are: lymphocytopenia, hypoplasia, deficiency of lymphocytes in lymphatic tissues normal cortical germinal centres. Recurrent infections with viruses, candida or pneumocystis carinii are common. Tests for assesing the humoral immune status are: measurement of immunglobulin levels in serum, isohaemagglutinins, tests for antibody formation following active immunization, in vitro tests. Clinical syndroms are: no germinal centres in lymphnodes, no plasma cells. Recurrent bacterial infections. Treatment of B-cell deficiencies: immunglobulin replacement therapy. Treatment of T-cell deficiencies by grafting of thymus transplants. Combined immune deficiencies are treated with bone marrow transplants from matched donors. For bone marrow transplantation germfree state seems to be the ideal situation to protect the patient against infection before the therapeutic maneuver and for prevention of graft versus host reaction in the posttransplantation period.\n",
      "[Effect of the chronic action of small doses of ionizing radiation of the excretion of gaseous metabolic products in albino rats]. White rats were kept in sealed chambers for 3 months and were exposed to chronic gamma-irradiation (100 mur/day). The effect of the exposure on the excretion of some metabolites--ammonia, acetone, carbon monoxide, phenol and organic substances measured by their oxidability--was studied. Under the influence of low doses of gamma-irradiation the excretion of acetone and organic substances decreased, whereas that of carbon monoxide, phenol and ammonia increased. Possible mechanisms responsible for these changes are discussed.\n",

The purpose of the measurements was to explore the use of the substances as urine conserving agents. Catamine-AB showed the highest antibacterial activity. Anthracoid spores exhibited the highest resistance to the substances; staphylococci were less resistant than E. coli. Investigations of the effectiveness of urine conservation demonstrated that catamine-AB at a concentration of 0.1% killed all Staph. aureus and E. coli. Therefore, it can be recommended as a urine conserving agent.\n",

      "Surgical management of severe aortic coarctation and interrupted aortic arch in neonates. Forty-four infants, 2 to 90 days of age, with severe obstructive lesions of the aortic arch, underwent emergency surgical correction between Jan. 1, 1966, and April 1, 1975. The typical clinical presentation was severe congestive heart failure and acidemia. Resection of an aortic coarctation with end-to-end anastomosis was performed in 31 patients. Eight (26 per cent) died after the operation. Since 1969, the mortality rate has been reduced to 14 per cent (3 of 22 patients) even though the incidence of major associated cardiac lesions has remained essentially constant (56 per cent from 1966 through 1969, 64 per cent from 1970 through March, 1975). This suggests that the higher survival rate has resulted from improved surgical techniques and postoperative care. The mortality rate in the infants operated upon during the second and third months of life was twice as high as that in those operated upon before the age of 1 month. Eight patients with Type A interrupted aortic arch were operated upon and 5 survived. Five patients with Type B aortic arch were operated upon and 3 survived.\n",
      "Pharmacological analysis of the adrenergic control of the cerebral circulation. The adrenergic control of the cerebral circulation was subjected to pharmacological analysis. The status of the cerebral circulation was assessed using radioisotope, electromagnetic and resistographic methods. EEG, ECG and arterial pressure were recorded. The acid-base equilibrium and oxygen tension were measured in the arterial blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The experiments showed that the sympathetic innervation plays an important role in controlling cerebral circulation and in the development of cerebrovascular disorders. This was indicated by the constriction of intracranial arteries induced by noradrenaline, stimulation of sympathetic nerves, reflex sympathetic activations and the effect of potassium chloride on the centrol nervous system. The pharmacological study demonstrated that constriction of the intracranial vessels is brought about by an activation of the sympatho-adrenal system which is mediated via alpha-adrenoreceptors of cerebral blood vessels.\n",
      "Cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in swine. In incubation studies with swine tissue slices, acetate-1-14C or glucose-U-14C as substrates were incorporated more readily into fatty acids and cholesterol in adipose tissue than other tissues tested. Cholesterol and fatty acid synthesizing acitivity was substantial in the small intestine. When acetate was available, liver, small intestine, and adipose tissue were important sites for cholesterol synthesis. Heart and aortic tissue had marginal levels of cholesterol synthesizing ability. Lipogenesis in adult swine liver, heart, and aortic tissue was extremely low. As in tissue slices, incorporation of acetyl-1-14C CoA into fatty acids by adipose homogenates indicated high lipogenic activity. Subcellular fractionations of heart and aortic tissue indicated that the heart microsomal fraction had the highest lipogenic activity as measured by the incroporation of acetyl-4-14C CoA into fatty acids. In adult swine adipose tissue, the incorporation of glucose-U-14C into fatty acid was higher than its incorporation into glyceride-glycerol. The synthesis of glyceride-glycerol from glucose-U-14C or acetate-1-14C in liver was higher than for fatty acid synthesis. The acitivity of acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, citrate cleavage enzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphat-malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was considerably higher in adipose tissue than in other tissues tested, paralleling its high lipogenic capacity.\n",
      "Insulin receptors of skeletal muscle: specific insulin binding sites and demonstration of decreased numbers of sites in obese rats. A membrane preparation was obtained from rat striated muscle. The preparation used has been shown to contain plasma membranes by electron microscopy as well as by enrichment in specific activity of both a plasma membrane enzyme \"marker\" (5'-nucleotidase) and cell surface 125I-incorporated radioactivity. The characteristics of 125I-insulin binding to this striated muscle preparation were studied, and it was found that 125I-insulin readily and specifically binds to this membrane preparation. The binding reaction was time, pH, and temperature dependent with optimal steady-state binding conditions occurring at 20 degrees C and at pH 7.6. Under these conditions (20 degrees C, pH 7.6) skeletal muscle plasma membranes displayed little ability to degrade insulin. Binding of 125I-insulin was readily inhibited at physiologic concentrations of unlabeled insulin and the specificity of this receptor for insulin was demonstrated by finding that high concentrations of glucagon, b-LH, b-FSH, p-PRL, hCG, TSH, and HGH were without effect on 125I-insulin binding and that insulin analogues inhibited binding in proportion to their biologic activity. When membranes from older, fatter rats were compared to membranes from younger, lean animals, 5'-nucleotidase specific activity and insulin degrading activity were found to be comparable. On the other hand, insulin binding to membrane receptors was decreased 30%-40% in the older, fatter animals. Thus, these studies indicate that (1) specific insulin receptors exist in skeletal muscle plasma membranes, and (2) membranes from older, fatter rats have fewer receptors than those from younger, lean animals.\n",
      "The role of potassium in the control of ammonium excretion during starvation. Administration of KC1 0.5 mmol/kg/day to subjects undergoin prolonged starvation reduced daily urinary ammonium and beta-hydroxybutyrate excretion by one-third. These changes were accompanied by an improvement in potassium balance and an increased rate of chloride excretion. A similar fall in ammonium excretion occurred in a second group of subjects after administration of KHCO3 0.5 mmol/kg/day. Ketone body and bicarbonate excretion remained unchanged in this group while potassium balance improved. In both the first and second groups urine pH fell significantly as the rate of excretion of urinary buffer (ammonium) decreased. When the dose of KHCO3 was increased to 1.5-2.0 mmol/kg/day in fasting subjects, the urine was alkalinized, and ammonium excretion fell to negligible levels, resulting in nitrogen sparing of 2.0 g/day. The results indicate that one-half of the increase in ammonium excretion observed in starvation is due to potassium deficiency. Nitrogen wastage caused by losses of urinary ammonium during starvation can be virtually eliminated by potassium supplementation and urinary alkalinization. The decrease in beta-hydroxybutyrate excretion after potassium chloride administration was not caused by a fall in the rate of nonionic diffusion of this organic acid related to the reduction in urine pH. The reason for the fall in beta-hydroxybutyrate excretion is not apparent, though it was associated with an increase in chloride excretion.\n",
      "Lactic acidosis: an experimental model. A model of spontaneous lactic acidosis was developed in alloxan diabetic rabbits by infusing intravenously beta-hydroxybutyric acid followed by a continuous infusion of NaHCO3. In half of the animals, the arterial lactate/pyruvate ratio rose from 2.5 mM/0.19mM to 20.4 mM/0.28 mM, and arterial pH fell to 7.16. In animals with lactic acidosis, the calculated ratio in blood of NAD/NADH was 1437 +/- 230, versus a normal value of 6754 +/- 1250. Both arterial PO2 and blood pressure were normal. Continued infusion of NaHCO3 led to increased blood lactate levels, with cardiorespiratory arrest in 36% of animals. Lactic acidosis did not develop in normal rabbits who were similarly treated. It is concluded that spontaneous lactic acidosis can be produced in diabetic, but not in normal, rabbits by infusion of beta-hydroxybutric acid followed by infusion of NaHCO3.\n",

      "[Production of glycolic acid by the cells of Chlorella pyrenoidosa]. The maximum production of glycolic acid by the cells of Chlorella pyrenoidosa, strain S-39, was found when the cells, grown at the content of carbon dioxide of 2% in the air and illumination of 2000 lx, were transferred to 10(-3) M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with barbotage by pure oxygen and illumination of 30,000 lx. The rate of production of glycolic acid during the first five minutes is the same in the light and darkness; later no glycolate is formed in the darkness while in the light glycolate is formed at a lower rate. Bicarbonate inhibits production of glycolate. Negative interaction has been established between oxygen and bicarbonate during their effect on the production of glycolic acid. These data confirm the production of glycolic acid in the cells of Chlorella pyrenoidosa from ribulose diphosphate which is oxidized by molecular oxygen with the participation of ribulose diphosphate carboxylase acting as an oxygenase.\n",
      "[Interrelationship between the intestinal microflora of lackey moth, brown-tail moth and the entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis]. The interrelationship between the intestine microflora of lackey moth (Malacosoma neustria L.), brown-tail moth (Nygmia phaeorrhoea L.) and entomopathogenic bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Berl.), Bac. thuringiensis var. galleriea, and Bac. thuringiensis KR3 was studied in vitro. Various organisms of the intestine microflora of lackey moth display bacteriostatic action towards Bac. thuringiensis var. galleriea and Bac. thuringiensis KR3 which is not typical of the microflora of brown-tail moth that manifests mainly the batericidal action. Yeast cultures have been isolated from the intestines of lackey moth; the cultures stimulated growth of the studied entomopathogenic bacterial test cultures. Therefore, weak virulent action of Bac. thuringiensis towards brown-tail moth, as compared to its action on lackey moth, may be due to the bactericidal properties of some intestine microorganisms of brown-tail moth, and also the absence in their intestines of microorganisms stimulating growth of the entomopathogenic bacteria.\n",
      "[Photoinduced reduction of NAD(P) in the cells of green sulfur bacteria]. The spectrum of a photoinduced increase in luminescence of the cells of the gree sulphur bacterium Chlorobium limicola f. thiosulfatophilum, within the range of 400 to 520 nm, was found to correspond to the spectrum of luminescence of NADH in the protein-bound form. Photoinduced reduction of NAD(P) in green bacteria, contrary to purple bacteria, is not susceptible to the action of p-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenlhydrazone which uncouples photophosphorylation. Therefore, in Chlorobium limicola f. thiosulfatophilum, NAD(P) is reduced by direct non-cyclic transport of electrons via the photosynthetic chain. NAD(P)H is utilized mainly in the system of CO2 fixation; the process is inhibited by fluoroacetate, and the inhibition is eliminated by substrates of the cycle of carboxylic acids.\n",
      "[Production of lecithinase by Bacillus thuringiensis]. The activity of lecithaniase was determined in 24 strains of Bacillus thuringiensis on four growth media. The highest accumulation of lecithinase was found on the Hottinger medium containing 0.5% of glucose and 0.56% of sodium bicarbonate. Lecithinase appears at the logarithmic growth phase, and its activity is maximal after 10 hours of growth (at the beginning of the stationary phase). Biosynthesis and accumulation of lecithinase occur at pH 6.0 to 9.0. Lecithinase was purified by salting out with ammonium sulphate (75% saturation). Lecithinase is a thermolabile protein; it is stable within pH range of 3.0 to 9.0 and is resistant to the action of trypsin and 8M urea.\n",
      "Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of pneumococci relatively insensitive to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. Penicillin-insensitive pneumococci, of 10 serotypes, which had been isolated in Australia and New Guinea from healthy carriers and patients with pneumococcal infections, were shown to be relatively resistant to penicillin G, penicillin V, methicillin, cloxacillin, cephaloridine and cephalothin, compared with pneumococci fully sensitive to penicillin G. Most penicillin-insensitive pneumococci either were fully sensitive to ampicillin or showed a slight decrease in sensitivity. The size of inoculum, measured in viable units, had little effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin G; this applied to both penicillin-insensitive and penicillin-sensitive pneumococci. In bacterial tests, the minimal bactericidal concentration of penicillin G either equalled or exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration.\n",

The corresponding DNAs carrying R-specific modification are resistant to the enzyme. The enzyme has been purified approximately 400-fold and is essentially free from contaminating double strand-directed unspecific exo- or endonuclease activity. Only Mg2+ is required as cofactor. The substrate DNAs are cleaved at specific sites. The double-stranded fragments produced from SPP1 DNA (molecular weight 2.5 x 10(7)) have an average molecular weight of about 3 x 10(5).\n",
      "Myo-inositol oxygenase from oat seedlings. Enzyme preparations from oat seedlings showing the activity of myo-inositol oxygenase (E.C.1.13.99.1) have been described previously. In contrast to myo-inositol oxygenase preparations from other sources, e.g. rat kidney or yeast, the oat enzyme seemed to exhibit a somewhat less stringent activity, acting on other inositols and inositol methyl ethers as well as on myo-inositol. By purification of the enzyme present in the extract from oat seedlings with the help of an affinity gel specific for enzymes acting on myo-inositol a homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained, which shows the same strict specificity as the myo-inositol oxygenase from other sources. It has a molecular weight of 62,000 and tends to aggregate to oligomers (up to tetramers) under physiological pH-values; in more alkaline media dissociation to monomers is observed. The action on the other inositols and inositol methyl ethers is apparently due to one or more other enzymes, which are also adsorbed on the affinity gel, but can be separated from the myo-inositol oxygenase by elution with increasing concentrations of myo-inositol.\n",
      "The uptake and extrusion of monovalent cations by isolated heart mitochondria. The factors involved in the movement of monovalent cations across the inner membrane of the isolate heart mitochondrion are reviewed. The evidence suggests that the energy-dependent uptake of K+ and Na+ which results in swelling of the matrix is an electrophoretic response to a negative internal potential. There are no clear cut indications that this electrophoretic cation movement is carrier-mediated and possible modes of entry which do not require a carrier are examined. The evidence also suggests that the monovalent cation for proton exchanger (Na+ greater than K+) present in the membrane may participate in the energy-dependent extrusion of accumulated ions. The two processes, electrophoreti c cation uptake (swelling) and exchange-dependent cation extrusion (contraction) may represent a means of controlling the volume of the mitochondrion within the functioning cell. A number of indications point to the possibility that the volume control process may be mediated by the divalent cations Ca+2 and Mg+2. Studies with mercurial reagents also implicate certain membrane thiol groups in the postulated volume control process.\n",
      "[Acid-alkaline equilibrium of the ferri-leg-hemoglobin of the lupine (Lupinus luteus L.) Spectral studies]. Influence of pH was studied on the absorption spectra (340-670 nm) and on the curves of abnormal dispersion of optic rotation (220-270 nm) of the lupine ferri-leg-hemoglobin (Lb). pH range of the existence of the lupine Lb native form was determined (pH 5.5-11.0 at 20-25degrees C). It has been shown that not only met-hydroxy transition (which is in a complicated manner connected with the ionization of both ligand-bound water and certain amino acid residues of globin) but the ionization of a group with pK approximately 5, too, in the native molecule produces a heterotropic effect onto the haem. Complex analysis of the acidic and alkaline denaturation evidences that these processes are cooperative and proceed via several stages. pK values and the number of tyrosine residues were determined; it has been shown that these amino acid moieties are \"buried\" in the protein molecule. The results are discussed on the basis of a tentative model of the lupine Lb spatial suggested by the authors.\n",
      "[Kinetic characteristics of DNA alkylation with some chloroethylmethylarylamines and elimination of alkylated bases from DNA]. Kinetics of DNA alkylation with 2',3'-o-[N-2-chloroethyl-N-methylamino)benzylidene]uridine (UCHRCL), uridine-5'-methylphosphate (MepUCHRCL) and 4-(N-2-chloroethyl-N-methylamino)benzylamine (NH2CH2RCl) and kinetics of elimination of alkylated bases have been studied. Efficiency of DNA alkylation (p/s-ratio of rate constant of alkylation to the sum of rate constants of by-reactions of an active intermediate formed from the reagent) increases with an increase of the positive charge of the reagents as well as efficiency of tRNA alkylation. Alkylated bases are eliminated from DNA; rate of elimination depends on the structure of the reagent; it decreases in the series NH2CH2R- greater than greater than UCHR-greater than MepUCHR-. Bases alkylated by NH2CH2RCl and UCHRCl are eliminated from DNA during alkylation; therefore plots of DNA alkylation by NH2CH2RCl have a maximum. DNA alkylated by MepUCHRCl is rather stable; alkylated bases are not eliminated during alkylation. Effect of temperature and pH on elimination has been studied.\n",

      "[Possibilities and results of shortened hospital treatment in pediatric surgery (author's transl)]. 2582 surgical operations on children - principally abdominal hernias and phimoses - are reported. Inpatient treatment required a stay of 3.2 days, 430 children were treated as outpatients. The 11 pediatricians working in the afflux area unanimously judged the shortened stay in hospital positive. Of the parents interviewed, only 1.3% did not agree with the short hospitalization and 4.8% disagreed with the outpatient therapy. The well-known psychic disturbances of small children by admission to hospital confirmed. The economic importance of a stay which can be reduced by 10 days compared with the present average is pointed out.\n",
      "[The diagnostic significance of immunoglobulin determination in chronic liver diseases. II. Relationships between immunoglobulin changes and degree of activity (author's transl)]. The relationship between the immunograms and aminotransferases, gamma-GT and AP were examined in 715 patients with hepatobiliary diseases closely confirmed by histomorphological criteria and a series of 60 normal subjects. The normal subjects showed positive relationships. These are largely lacking in acute and protracted courses and in chronic aggressive hepatitis. Only relationships of the individual immunoglobulins between themselves can be demonstrated in the aggressive chronic types. Positive relationships are present between immunograms and aminotransferases, gamma-GT and AP in the group with fatty livers, and so are other highly significant positive relationships in toxic hepatitis and toxic cirrhoses of the liver.\n",
      "[pH-dependence of the mechanism of pepsin action]. N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine inhibition of the peptic hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine-L-tyrosine over the pH range 2-4.5 was studied. The mixed character of inhibition which was partially competitive and partially non-competitive allowed us to infer that the separate steps of the enzymatic hydrolysis were pH dependent. The orderliness of the dissociation of the triple enzyme-product-product complex was also pH dependent. The group with pKa approximately 3 influenced the mechanisms of pepsin hydrolysis as strongly as in the case of pepsin catalyzed oxygen isotopic exchange in the acyl amino acid carboxyl group.\n",
      "Caffeine enhancement of digestion of DNA by nuclease S1. The activity of Aspergillus orzae nuclease S1 on DNA has been investigated under varying pH and metal ion conditions. Nuclease S1 was found to preferentially digest denatured DNA. With native DNA as substrate the enzyme could only digest the DNA when caffeine was added to the reaction mixture. The enzyme was more active in sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), than in either standard saline citrate (PH 7.0) or sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Caffeine was also found to affect the thermal stability of DNA, resulting in a melting profile characterized by two transitions. The first transition (poorly defined) was below the normal melting temperature of the DNA, while the next transition was at the normal melting temperature of the DNA, while the next transition was at the normal melting temperature of the DNA. The susceptibility of caffeine-treated DNA to nuclease digestion seems to be a result of the local unwinding that caffeine causes in the regions of DNA that melt in the first transition. This selective destabilization presumably sensitizes the unwound regions to nuclease hydrolysis. The hydrolysates of the DNA digested by nuclease S1 were subjected first to ion exchange chromatography followed by paper chromatography. The results from this partial characterization of the digestion products showed that they contain mononucleotides as well as oligonucleotides of varying lengths. The base composition of the mononucleotide digests suggests that caffeine has greater preference for interacting with A-T base-pairs in DNA.\n",
      "[Isolation and properties of polyphosphatase of Neurospora crassa]. Polyphosphatase (polyphosphate-phosphohydrolase) has been isolated from mycelium of Neurospora crassa and purified to homogenous state. The enzyme is shown to be strictly specific to high molecular weight inorganic polyphosphates. Km for phosphate in polymeric form is 6.8-10(-4) M. The molecular weight of this enzyme is 50 000 +/- 3000. To display its activity polyphosphatase requires the presence of bivalent cations of some metals, Mg2+ ions being the best activator with Co2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ ions-slightly less effective.\n",
      "[Isolation of rat liver chromatin non-histone protein]. A chromatin with the protein/DNA ratio of 3.0 was obtained from rat liver cells nuclei. The chromatin was dissolved in 2 M NaCl, pH 7, and reprecipitated by decreasing the ionic strength to 0.4 and increasing pH to 9.0. A fraction of non-histone proteins (NH-1) remained in a supernatant solution, the NH-1/DNA ratio being equal to 1.3 and the ratio of acidic to basic aminoacid residues equal to 1.31. After chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 cation-exchang resin, a fraction (NH-2) with the NH-2/DNA ratio of 1.0 +/- 0.15 and the ratio of acidic to basic aminoacid residues of 1.57 was obtained. According to the data of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the NH-2 fraction contained 2.7% of histone f2 + f3 as an admixture whereas histone f1 was not revealed.\n",
      "Cimetidine suppression of nocturnal gastric secretion in active duodenal ulcer. Nocturnal pain and gastric hypersecretion are common in duodenal ulcer. Therefore, we investigated the antisecretory effects of a new H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine, in 200-, 300- or 400-mg doses, taken orally at bedtime. The 200-mg dose did not cause a statistically significant change in nocturnal (midnight to 7 a.m.) acid output and had only a borderline effect on pH. However, the 300-mg and 400-mg doses significantly (P less than 0.001) lowered acid output and increased (P less than 0.01) intragastric pH. All doses caused substantial decreases in secretory volume output. After a 400-mg dose, half the patients remained anacidic for eight hours. Dose-related increases of drug blood levels were observed and correlated with the degree and duration of inhibition of acid output. Serum gastrin levels were unaffected. Cimetidine appears to be a potent inhibitor of nocturnal gastric secretion.\n",

      "Differential inhibition of sclerotial germination in Whetzelinia sclerotiorum. A number of diverse compounds including divalent metal ions, simple sugars, and common counterions, buffers, and fungicides were surveyed in the laboratory with regard to ability to inhibit germination of field-collected sclerotia from Whetzelinia sclerotiorum. Many compounds were inhibitory and several were comparable in effectiveness to benomyl and other commercial fungicides. Different levels of a given inhibitor were needed to prevent stipe formation, apothecial formation or mycelial germination. Inhibition was not correlated with ionic strength or related to pH.\n",
      "[Biophysical primary processes in photosynthetic membranes. Data with pulse-spectroscopical methods]. The electron transfer in the photosynthetic membrane of green plants from H2O to NADP+ is driven by two chlorophyll reaction centers in series. The electron transfer converts one part of the light energy into the form of the reducing power of NADPH. The transfer initiates an electrical field across the membrane. The electrical energy of the charged membrane is an additional state into which light energy is converted. Protolytic reactions coupled with the electron transfer lead to a proton translocation into the inner space of the thylakoid. The discharging of the ectrically energized membrane by H+ efflux is coupled with the formation of ATP.\n",
      "Mechanism of action of anticonvulsants. Role of the differential effects on the active uptake of putative neurotransmitters. The effect of pentobarbital and phenytoin on the high-affinity uptake of the putative neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and norepinephrine was examined in synaptosomes prepared from rat brain. Both pentobarbital and phenytoin inhibited the uptake of norepinephrine. Pentobarbital increased the uptake of GABA twofold and only slightly increased the uptake of glutamate. Phenytoin facilitated GABA uptake to a lesser extent than did pentobarbital, but also increased the uptake of glutamate. This suggests that these drugs may limit the propagation of seizures through the balance of excitatory glutamate pathways and inhibitory GABA and norepinephrine pathways. The contrasting effects of these drugs on GABA and glutamate uptake may be related to the hypnotic properties of pentobarbital not present in phenytoin.\n",

We have studied the effect of chlorpromazine and PGF2alpha on the blood and amniotic fluid levels of prolactin over a 1-hour period of time in women who were in the 14th-20th week of gestation. Following intramuscular injection of chlorpromazine, maternal plasma prolactin rose 1.0- to 2.5-fold. No significant change was noted in maternal plasma after PGF2alpha administration. Amniotic fluid prolactin declined by 6 to 56%. These changes may be dilutional.\n",

      "Cobalamins in fibroblasts cultured from normal control subjects and patients with methylmalonic aciduria. The intracellular content and proportional distribution of B12 (cobalamin) derivatives in fibroblasts cultured from patients with various forms of methylmalonic aciduria, as well as from normal control subjects, has been determined by a two-dimensional chromatobioautographic technique. Each line of fibroblasts was grown in the presence of four concentrations of cobalamin, ranging from the 0.04-0.07 pmol/ml contained in the basal medium to 74 pmol/ml (100 ng/ml), added in form of hydroxocobalamin (OH-CHl). Control cells grown in the basal medium contained substantial proportions of both methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenysylcobalamin (AdoCbl), with the former predominating. As increasing concentrations of OH-CBl were added to the growth medium, the total cellular cobalamin content increased without marked changes in the relative proportions of MeCbl, AdoCbl, and OH-Cbl. Three different patterns were discernable in the cobalamin distributions of the cells cultured from patients with methylmalonic aciduria (Table 1 and Fig. 1).\n",

      "Semantic desensitization: language conditioning or demand characteristics manipulation? Previous studies in language conditioning, especially those called semantic desensitization, have shown changes in self-report, behavioral measures, and the semantic meaning of the target concept following treatment. This last has been proposed as a causal variable but experimental and control groups differed greatly in terms of their demand characteristics. The present study included a placebo group with demand characteristics similar to those of the control group. The target area was self-concept (18 male Ss, 9 female Ss). Significant changes in self-report and actual performance with a hand dynamometer were obtained but these were as great for the placebo group as for the experimental groups. It was suggested that factors other than conditioning are of importance in semantic desensitization.\n",
      "[Polyarteritis nodosa: general aspects and occurrence in domestic animals, particularly in association with nosematosis in blue foxex (author's transl)]. A survey of polyarteritis nodosa in domestic animals is presented, including a description of the patho-morphological lesions and a discussion on the causal factors. This vascular disease occurs in domestic animals in association with both viral infections (infectious plasmacytosis in mink), bacterial infections (erysipelas in swine), and protozoan infections (nosematosis in blue foxes). The conclusion is drawn that the observations in domestic animals support the view that immunological disturbances are involved as pathogenetic mechanisms. Nosematosis is dealt with in more detail; the infecting agent (fig. 1), Nosema cuniculi (Encephalitozoon cuniculi), is a widespread mamalian parasite, which causes cerebral and renal lesions in blue foxes of the same type as in animals of other species. In addition, the vascular system throughout the body is affected, resulting in patho-morphological alterations corresponding to classical polyarteritis nodosa (Fig. 2). In the early stages of involvement, masses of parasitic organisms are regularly found within the walls of affected arteries (Fig. 3). This disease is frequently lethal, and always accompanied by elevated values of gamma globulins. Both the hypergammaglobulinemia and the tissue lesions, seem at times, at least in part, to be reversible.\n",
      "[Caesarean section in sows anesthetized with Azaperone and Metomidate (author's transl)]. 213 caesarean sections and 157 hysterectomies were carried out in gilts and sows with different body weight (table I). The neuroleptic Azaperone and the hypnotic Metomidate were used for anaesthesia with different administration (table II). Local analgesia and premedication with Atropine. The duration of the anaesthesia was 45 minutes and where prolongation was necessary, Metomidate, Azaperone or barbiturates were used alone or in combinations once or more. The indications (table III) for caesarean section were retarded birth in 70 sows, dislocation of uterus in 74 sows and in 69 sows by other indications. Hysterectomy was indicated by retarded birth in 93 sows, dislocations of uterus in 40 cases and in 24 cases by other indications. In 183 operations (table IV) 1006 living piglets were delivered, and 703 were alive at discharge (70%). The chances of survival depends on the composition of the litter, in litters of piglets alive only, 76% survived at discharge; in litters consisting of both alive and stillborn 69% survived and 59% survived in litters consisting of piglets alive and post mortem piglets. The total survival of the sows was 78%, 80% after caesarean section and 76% after hysterectomy. It is pointed out that most of the patients operated were in a very late phase of birth.\n",
      "Formation and in-vivo-distribution of different 99mTc-Sn-pyrophosphate complexes. The formation of two different 99mTc-Sn-pyrophosphate complexes was determined by evaluation of their in vivo distribution in rats. It was found that formation of a 2 : 2 Sn : PyP complex, which is bone seeking, is depending as well on the pyrophosphate as on the hydrogen ion concentration in the equilibrium. On the contrary, formation of a 2 : 1 Sn : PyP complex, which shows no bone affinity but concentrate in the kidneys, is hydrogen ion independent and occurs even at very low pyrophosphate concentrations. The probable structure of these complexes is discussed.\n",
      "Separation of (3') deoxynucleotides with cation exchange columns. A procedure is described for a one-step separation of synthetic (3') deoxynucleotides purchased commercially or those purified and isolated from the enzymatic digests of DNA. The method is simple. A 50 ml buret was used for column which was filled with the resin slurry and packed at water aspirator pressure. The compounds were eluted from the column at atmospheric pressure under gravity flow using a fraction collector and read on a Beckman DU spectrophotometer. Recoveries were in excess of 90% and no accessory devices were required. The use of a volatile buffer, e.g. ammonium formate facilitated the recovery of the purified material by allowing the evaporation of the medium in which the sample was eluted.\n",
      "Interactions between anticonvulsants. Anticonvulsant drug interactions have been investigated using multiple linear regression analyses. The one statistically significant interaction found was that in which phenytoin dosage decreased plasma carbamazepine concentrations. There was a suggestion that carbamazepine and phenobarb dosage tended to increase phenytoin levels. No interaction was detected between phenytoin and sulthiame. Studies in individuals suggested that ethosuximide may increase plasma phenytoin concentration and that clonazepam tends to decrease carbamazepine and phenytoin concentrations.\n",
      "Renin and hemodynamic changes via central adrenergic, cholinergic, and sodium receptor mechanisms in conscious rats. The effects of centrally administered autonomic drugs and hypertonic saline on renin release were studied in the conscious rat. A 0.3 mug intraventricular dose of isoproterenol, which is one-thirtieth of the intraperitoneal dose required to stimulate renin release, induced the release of renin into the systemic circulation. Norepinephrine had no effect on renin release in the same dose range. Hypertonic saline and carbachol suppressed renin release. Alterations in renin release were preceded by a reciprocal change in blood pressure. These results suggest a central nervous system site for sodium, beta-adrenergic, and cholinergic receptors in altering renin release and blood pressure.\n",
      "Hepatic sodium-potassium exchange induced by adrenomimetic amines. The effects of catecholamines on hepatic K+ and Na+ movements were studied in anesthetized dogs by measuring systemic arterial and hepatic venous electrolyte composition following intraportal injections of adrenergic agonists. All catecholamines studied caused the initial loss and subsequent uptake of K+ by the liver. The loss of hepatic K+ was accompanied by an uptake of Na+ at a 1:1 ratio. This accumulation of Na+ continued, although at a slower rate, for at least 8 min. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were much more potent in these effects than either phenylephrine or isoproterenol. Neither alpha- nor beta-adrenergic blockade, singly or in combination, had an appreciable effect on the magnitude or duration of the observed ion shifts. It is concluded that the predominant effect of catecholamines is to produce a net accumulation of hepatic Na+, and that the mechanism governing hepatic ion movements is nonadrenergic as defined by stimulation by specific adrenergic agonists and inhibition by specific adrenergic antagonists.\n",
      "Canine cardiac lymph potassium, pH and flow after experimental myocardial infarction. Canine cardiac lymph was studied after acute experimental myocardial infarction. The lymph potassium concentration remained the same, the lymph potassium content increased, the lymph pH decreased, and the lymph flow increased while the serum potassium and pH remained the same. It is suggested that localized hypoxia may result in cellular changes that release substances, e.g., potassium, to the interstitial space where they mobilize fluid and enhance lymph flow.\n",
      "Regulation of proinsulin synthesis in isolated rat islets. (1) A system is described for studying the short-term effects of agents on proinsulin synthesis in vitro, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]leucine into isolated proinsulin. (2) Of the agents tested, glucose has the most marked, and apparently earliest, effect on proinsulin synthesis. (3) The adenyl cyclase system participates in the regulation of proinsulin synthesis since exogenous cyclic AMP, glucagon, and caffeine are stimulatory. When cyclic AMP is added to the medium in the presence of glucose, it is the most potent agent acting on the adenyl cyclase-phosphodiesterase system.

      "Myocardial substrate utilization in anaphylactic shock. Changes in myocardial substrate utilization were studied in anesthetized dogs following the production of anaphylactic shock. Mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and pH decreased significantly during this form of shock. Myocardial FFA oxidation was greatly diminished especially within the first hour following challenge and lactate uptake more than doubled during the same time. Thus, it is concluded that myocardial substrate utilization shifted away from FFA and towards lactate during anaphylactic shock and these changes resembled those observed following an acute, severe hemorrhage, or the administration of E. coli endotoxin.\n",

      "The effects of salicylic acid on metabolism and potassium ion content in yeast. Under anaerobic conditions, at low pH and 30 degrees, commercial baker's yeast loses K+ ion in the presence of salicylic acid. Glucose utilization is inhibited. In suspensions containing no glucose, carbohydrate stores of the cell are dissimilated to carbon dioxide and alcohol. The ion loss and inhibitory effects of salicylic acid on glucose utilization are reversed by washing the cells free of salicylate. The loss of K+ appears to be due at least partly to a K+-H+ exchange process. An unexplained maximum is seen in the curves of either net K+ loss or K+ efflux versus salicylic acid concentration. At 6 degrees the effects of salicylic acid on both endogenous metabolism and net K+ loss are minimal. Furthermore, no maximum is seen in the K+ loss-salicyclic concentration curve at this temperature. It is generalized that salicylic acid or salicylate may elicit K+ leakage from many types of cells, i.e., a fundamental action of this compound may be its ability to affect (reduce) K+ content of the cell; furthermore, it appears that the salicylate effects on K+ loss may be associated in an as-yet-unknown manner with the metabolic effects of this compound. The effects of salicylate on K+ loss in yeast may not be unique for this compound, since no experiments of this nature have been done with other penetrating undissociated acids.\n",
      "The size pH, and redox potential of the cecum in mice associated with various microbial floras. Cecal size and in situ redox potential and pH of cecal contents were determined in conventionally reared mice and mice reared under a variety of gnotobiotic conditions: germfree, monoassociated with a cecal Clostridium sp., hexaflora-associated and thermoduric polyflora-associated. The mean Eh was approximately +200 mV in germfree and -200 mV in conventional mice. The Eh was close to zero in the monoassociated mice, thus occupying a position intermediate between the germfree and conventional mice. The potentials observed in the hexaflora and the thermoduric flora groups were indistinguishable from those of conventional animals. The degree of normalization was more advanced with respect to the redox potential than to the cecal size in the various gnotobiotic groups. In the thermoduric polyflora-associated group, normalization was observed in both cecal size and redox potential. This demonstrates that normalization can be accomplished with a relatively simplified microflora, at least with regard to the parameters studied.\n",
      "Plasma prolactin levels in maturing intact and cryptorchid male rats: development of stress response. In order to determine the possible role of the seminiferous tubules in the regulation of prolactin secretion during sexual development, male rats were rendered cryptorchid at 22 days of age, and thereafter different groups of animals were decapitated at 8-10 day intervals between Day 32 and Day 70. Cryptorchid rats showed destruction of the germinal epithelium accompanied by increased plasma FSH and, to a much lesser extent, increased plasma LH titers. Nevertheless, plasma prolactin levels were similar to those of intact controls throughout the entire period studied. Plasma prolactin titers in intact controls remained uniformly low from Day 20 to Day 70, contrasting with previous reports in which increasing prolactin levels have been observed during sexual development. To determine the reason for this apparent discrepancy, a longitudinal experiment was conducted in which intact and cryptorchid male rats were bled every 10 days from Day 30 to Day 70, following a 3-min period of exposure to ether fumes. The prolactin response to this stress increased markedly with age. A similar pattern of prolactin was observed in a cross-sectional study in which different groups of intact animals were bled following a 3-min period of ether exposure, at ages ranging from 20 to 70 daysmthe results indicate that unlike FSH secretion, prolactin secretion is not controlled by the seminiferous tubules. In addition, they suggest that the pattern of increasing plasma prolactin previously described in the developing male rat is at least in part caused by an age-dependent increase in responsiveness of prolactin to stress.\n",

Isophthalic acid, 5-carboxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 5-methoxy-, 5-fluoro-, 5-bromo-, 5-cyano-, and 5-methylisophthalic acid were inhibitors competitive with L-glutamate for bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase. The extent of inhibition by the derived compounds was not much greater than that obtained with the parent compound, isophthalic acid. A plot of pKi versus pH showed the presence of an ionizable group (pKa 7.4-7.8) at the enzyme active site which interacted with the substitutent at the 5 position of the substituted isophthalates.\n",
      "Dehydrogenation of reduced pyridine nucleotides by Leydig cell tumors of the rat testis. The activities of the cytochrome c reductases and of the D-T diaphorase in rat Leydig cell tumors have been described. The increase in enzymatic activity of the NADH cytochrome c reductase activity in functional tumors derived from interstitial cells of the rat testis is interpreted as being possibly related to hydroxylation of steroids by the neoplastic cells. Meanwhile, the increase in the activity of the D-T diaphorase in the other tumor is interpreted as being an anaplerotic reaction to substitute for the deficient shuttles for the transfer of reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria observed in tumors.\n",

      "[Effects of antianxiety drugs on the food intake in trained and untrained rats and mice (author's transl)]. Various minor tranquilizers (benzodiazepines, barbiturates and meprobamate) induced an increase in the food intake of rats or mice. Drugs were injected i.p. 30 min before testing and the amount of food consumed during 30 min was recorded. The enhanced food consumption occurred when the animals were in a novel situation, in a situation which they had previously experienced, or in their home cage, in which they were used to eating in the daytime within 30 min. Studies with two benzodiazepines showed this effect to be maximal between 10 to 30 min after injection and to disappear 4 hrs after injection. Moreover, minor tranquilizers reduce the latency before eating of rats and mice tested in a new situation. These results and the observation of anti-anxiety drugs-induced hyperphagia in satiated animals suggest that: 1. The enhanced food consumption of a non familiar food in a novel situation induced by the minor tranquilizers could hardly be related only to their anti-anxiety action. 2. The existence of some inhibitory controls (endogenous satiety in daytime or satiety after recent absorption) is not essential for the action of the minor tranquilizers. 3. An increased motivation and a disruption in the food related behavior could possibly be an explanation for all the observed effects.\n",
      "LSD as an agonist at mesolimbic dopamine receptors. The dopamine agonist apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) produced an enhanced stimulation of locomotor activity compared to control animals in rats injected bilaterally 14 days previously with 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) into the nucleus accumbens. (+)-Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) also produced a marked stimulation of locomotor activity in the 6OHDA treated animals at a dose (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) which was ineffective in control rats. (+)-Bromo-lysergic acid diethylamide (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) did not stimulate locomotor activity in 6OHDA treated rats. The locomotor stimulation produced by LSD was blocked by pretreatment with the dopamine antagonist pimozide (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). It is suggested that LSD acts as an agonist at mesolimbic dopamine receptors.\n",
      "Effects of various inhibitors of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase on rat self-stimulation after reserpine treatment. The behavioral effects of low doses of the catecholamine (CA) synthesis inhibitor, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT, 50 mg/kg i.p.), or the norepinephrine (NE) synthesis inhibitors (FLA-63, 15 mg/kg i.p., U-14624, 50 mg/kg i.p., or disulfiram 150 mg/kg i.p.) were studied in rats pretreated with reserpine (1 mg/kg i.p.) 24 h before. Rats were implanted either in the area ventralis tegmenti (AVT) or in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). The modifications of CA synthesis and endogenous CA levels were estimated in a parallel experiment. Reserpine treatment produced a slow decrease in self-stimulation (SS) rates during the first 12 h; SS rates were 85% of control values 24 h after reserpine treatment. Injection of alpha-MPT in reserpine-pretreated rats inhibited SS (85% decrease 3 h after administration either in AVT or LH rats), whereas dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibition had no great effect on SS. The administration of very low doses of alpha-MPT (20 mg/kg i.p.) to rats treated with reserpine (24 h before) plus FLA-63 (1 h before) induced an important decrease in SS rates in AVT-implanted rats only. The major conclusion is that dopaminergic neurons seem to be involved in AVT and LH SS. The last experiment suggests the involvement of a balance between dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons in AVT SS.\n",
      "Immunologic phagocytosis by macrophages: effect by stimulation of alpha adrenergic receptors. Alpha adrenergic stimulating drugs, metaraminol, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, was found to increase, in vitro, immunological phagocytosis by mice peritoneal macrophages. This effect could be inhibited by dibenamine, a blocking agent. The stimulation by alpha adrenergic agents was similar to that caused by drugs that reduce the intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate or by drugs that increase the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate.\n",
      "[Uric acid as electronic acceptor of chicken liver's XDH (author's transl)]. Uric acid seems to act as an electronic acceptor in the dehydrogenation of hypoxanthine catalyzed by chicken liver's xanthinedehydrogenase (XDH). Oxidation was observed in crude homogenates under anaerobic conditions, although dialyzed homogenates or purified hepatic XDH also induce a similar action either in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The reaction pH optimum is about 6.0. Xanthine appears to be the only inhibited product of the reaction when its concentration is greater than 1 X 10(-4) M. When hypoxanthine and uric acid concentrations exceed 2 X 10(-3) M and 1 X 10(-4) M, respectively, they induce inhibition by substrate. Purine is a fairly good substrate of XDH when uric acid acts as acceptor. Allopurinol inhibits hypoxanthine oxidation by uric acid in the presence of XDH. XDH also catalyzes the dismutation of xanthine to hypoxanthine and uric acid.\n",
      "Studies on the anoxic inhibition of myocardial protein synthesis. The present study demonstrates that exposure of cardiac muscle to high levels of glucose during anoxia appears to retard damage to myocardial protein synthesis. The mechanism of this \"glucose\" effect is glucose-specific and appears related to the intracellular metabolism of glucose by the anoxic myocardium.\n",
      "Phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and palmitoyl coenzyme A hydrolase in cardiac subcellular fractions. The characteristics of the two enzymes related to fatty acid esterifaction were studied in order to provide fundamental information leading to further understanding of the control of myocardial glyceride formation. Palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase are both distributed unevenly among heart subcellular fractions. The activity of the latter enzyme in subcellular fractions changes independently in response to Mg2+ addition and in response to thyroid hormone treatment of animals.\n",
      "Force development of isoproterenol-damaged frog heart muscle in cyanide anoxia. From recent experiments it is indicated that in frogs living at +25 degrees C the abnormal response to cyanide anoxia appears as soon as 4-5 hr after the first isoproterenol (IPR) injection, but the aneurysm does not appear until a few hours after the second injection of IPR. There is evidently a discrepancy between the biochemical and structural effects of IPR on the heart. The biochemical effects are probably transient as we have observed that a normal response to cyanide reappears a few weeks after the second IPR injection. It might thus be concluded that IPR causes derangement to the cells also in hearts without any visible lesions and demonstrated as a lowered resistance to histotixic anoxia. This effect precedes any structural damage if such should occur and is of a transient nature.\n",
      "The role of H+ in temporary hypoxic contractility failure: different effects of pH on the force decay and on the force recovery after reoxygenation. The contractility of isolated ventricle strips of the frog heart (Rana pipiens) was studied under temporary N2 hypoxia and during subsequent recovery after reoxygenation under different extracellular H ion concentrations (pH 6.0-8.5). The recovery of contractile force was three times more pH-sensitive than force decay. Under slow pacing (12/min) at +12 degrees C there was almost complete recovery to control values within 60 min at pHe above 7.0. Under this pH level recovery was largely delayed (pH 6.5) or did not occur (pH 6.0). Prolongation of contraction during the reoxygenation phase, observed at low H ion concentrations, was largely delayed or absent under high concentrations of H ions.\n",
      "Effect of variations in pH on kinetics of myosin. The pH optimum was the same in canine tissue for cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin; when myosin was activated by monovalent cations, the pH optimum was 7.5 while activation of myosin by divalent cations gave a pH optimum of 5.5. Protons were needed for divalent cation activation of myosin. With changes in pH there were concomitant changes in the apparent affinity of enzyme for substrate (S 0.5), such that with a decrease in pH there was an elevation in K+- or NH4+ -activated myosin's apparent affinity for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and at the same time a decrease in Vmax values of myosin. The converse was true with the divalent cations, Ca++ and Mn++; here with a decrease in pH there was a concomitant decrease in apparent affinity of myosin for ATP, and at the same time an increase in the enzymatic Vmax values. It appeared that hydrogen ions affected the apparent affinity of myosin for substrate and this in turn affected the rate-limiting step in ATPase reaction. Addition of monovalent cations to the divalent cation activating system lowered the activity of myosin, and the converse was true: divalent cations lowered the activity of myosin when activated by monovalent ones in a monovalent cation activating system.\n",
      "Distribution of prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductase and NAD+-dependent and NADP+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in the renal cortex and medulla of various species. Regional distributions of PGE 9-ketoreductase and 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase were examined in the cytoplasmic fractions from the kidneys of seven species. All species contained an NADPH-dependent reductase, as well as NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases in both cortex and medulla. A previously unrecognized cytoplasmic NADH-dependent PGE 9-ketoreductase was also detected in the cortex and medulla of rat and bovine kidney. Total NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase activity was about equally distributed between the two renal regions of monkey, dog, rat, and swine. Bovine, rabbit, and cat had greater cortical than medullary dehydrogenase activity with ratios of 3, 5, and 10 respectively. The activities of NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase varied among the renal tissues.\n",
      "Normal blood-gas values in lambs during neonatal development and in adult sheep. Arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) tensions and pH were determined in 20 lambs during development from two weeks to five months of age and in 34 adult sheep. Throughout the period the lambs' mean PaCO2 (33.1 mm Hg) and pH (7.46) values were similar to those determined in the adult sheep (PaCO232.1 mm Hg; pH 7.48). The lamb's mean PaO2 increased from 63.3 mm Hg at two weeks of age to about 80 mm Hg at eight weeks and by 20 weeks was similar to the mean PaO2 (88.0 mm Hg) of adult sheep.\n",
      "[The clinical importance of angiography in the diagnosis of periarteritis nodosa]. Report on a 53 years old patient with renal failure. Angiography showed multiple micro-aneurysms in kidneys and liver, in some instances also in the pancreatic, duodenal and mesenterial arteries. Muscle biopsy confirmed the suspicion of arteriitis nodosa. Clinically the diagnosis of necrotizing arteriitis is difficult. Angiography settles the diagnosis, but only positive findings of micro-aneurysms prove it. The differential diagnosis is discussed and illustrated.\n",
      "pH and the cytotoxicity of fluoride in an animal cell culture system. To investigate the mechanism for the toxicity of silicate cement as observed in a cell culture system, the effects of pH and fluoride were tested on human epithelial cells (NCTC 2544). At pH 7.3, fluoride concentrations from 15 to 25 mug/ml (0.79 to 1.3 mM) had a growth inhibitory effect. When pH of the incubation medium was lowered in the range 7.0 to 6.4, an enhanced cytoxic effect of fluoride was found, and even at 5 to 10 mug/ml growth inhibition occurred. Concomitant with the enhanced cytotoxicity of fluoride at low pH, there was an increased utilization of glucose and formation of lactate. Upon lowering the pH of the incubation medium from 7.4 to 6.7 a twofold increase in the intracellular concentration of fluoride was found.\n",
      "Dysplasia of the testis and epididymis. Various congenital malformations of the testis and the seminal pathways are illustrated by 10 cases. Though these malformations are often free from symptoms, an increasing number of them are now being discovered in connection with investigations of male infertility. In cases of azoospermia where testicular biopsies show complete spermatogenesis, surgical exploration is indicated. Some of these malformations may then be treated by surgery, with fairly good prospects of restored fertility.\n",
      "[Lipoprotein X in hepatobiliary diseases]. The diagnostic and prognostic reliability of lipoprotein-X (Lp-X) in demonstrating or ruling out cholestasis has been evaluated in a group of 80 patients with diseases of the liver and/or the biliary tracts, and in 103 subjects with various other diseases. The results of Lp-X detection were compared with the so-called \"enzymes indicating cholestasis\": alkaline phosphatase, leucine arylamidase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Where possible a histologic specimen of the liver was obtained. The correlation between Lp-X and \"enzymes indicating cholestasis\" was satisfactory in more than 90% of cases. When compared with the histologic findings, Lp-X proved to be more reliable than the enzymes. Despite this fact, Lp-X did not show absolute specifity in the detection of cholestasis as there were several negative results in cases with histologically proven cholestasis. Furthermore, the differentiation of intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis was not possible on the basis of Lp-X. In the control group of 103 patients with other than hepatobiliary diseases, a positive Lp-X result was found in 3 cases. Further investigations in these three patients revealed that primarily unsuspected hepatobiliary disease could not be ruled out. In the follow-up of a hepatobiliary disease the transition of Lp-X to negative indicates a trend towards improvement of cholestasis 1-2 weeks earlier than the enzymes mentioned above.\n",

Longterm therapy of chronic bacterial bronchitis assumes two forms: (a) therapy of acute exacerbations, and (b) continuous longterm prophylaxis, chiefly during the 4-7 winter months. Longterm prophylaxis should be confined exclusively to patients with two or more severe annual exacerbations. The commonest pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococci, are usually sensitive to ampicillin and amoxycillin, cotrimoxazole (Bactrim or Eusaprim) and tetracyclines.\n",
      "[Isolation, identification and quantitative determination of lysolecithin in the human gastric juice]. Lysolecithin was isolated and identified from the gastric contents of 5 patients with gastric ulcer and erosive and atrophic gastritis. The methods used involved methanolic extration, column chromatography on silica gel and sephadex gel filtration, followed by preparative thin layer chromatography. Identification of lysolecithin was verified in one sample by thin layer chromatography and elementary analysis. A method for quantitation of lysolecithin in human gastric fluid for routine clinical analysis is described, based on the procedure used for identification of this phospholipid. Further, a hemolysis test is proposed for screening gastric contents for lysolecithin concentrations above approximately 10 mg/100 ml. With the quantitative method, an average concentration of 66.1 mg of lysolecithin in 100 ml gastric content was found in the group of 5 patients. The screening test was positive in all 5 samples, but was negative with native gastric juice in 25 persons serving as controls. When the gastric fluid of the controls was concentrated, however, 9 samples gave a positive hemolytic reaction. From these 9 specimens, the lysolecithin concentration was found to average 0.9 mg/100 ml. These findings afford evidence that lysolecithin may be involved as a factor in the pathogenesis of gastric ulceration.\n",
      "[Prinzmetal angina: clinical aspects and coronarographic findings]. The clinical course and coronary arteriographic findings in 5 patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina pectoris are reviewed. In 4 patients who had ST-elevations inferiorly, 1 had minimal, 1 only slight, and 1 medium coronary artery disease; 1 had coronary spasm. 1 patient with ST-elevation anteriorly had severe stenosis of the anterior descending coronary artery. All 5 patients had normal left ventriculograms, 3 also had normal left enddiastolic pressure, and 2 slight elevation. Medical treatment was carried out in 2 patients and surgical revascularization in 2. Both treatments were accompanied by marked symptomatic improvement. Spontaneous loss of angina occurred in 1 patient. Prinzmetal's variant angina pectoris may be accompanied by a variety of coronary arteriographic findings and the prognosis appears to be more favorable than previously reported.\n",

      "[Sugar-free, tooth-protecting chewing gum and candy. Results of a 7-year study]. Experiences of 7 years with sugarless chewing gums and lozenges (tab. I and II) regarding their tooth protective properties are reported. Telemetry of interproximal plaque pH allows to assess acid formation from carbohydrates by plaque bacteria under almost natural conditions. Altogether, 5 chewing gums and 8 lozenges containing sorbitol or mixtures of sorbitol and hydrogenated oligosaccharides were investigated. Lowest pH values during and after chewing sugarless gums varied between pH 6.0 and 7.3. When sucking sugarless lozenges the recorded pH values were between 5.8 and 7.0. In contrast to lozenges, the consumption of sugarless chewing gums becomes particularly important due to their greater stimulation of saliva and buffering capacity of oral fluid. All products tested did not acidify interproximal plaque below the critical pH and therefore comply with the regulations of the Swiss Federal Health Authorities with respect to the labeling or marketed sweets with \"safe for teeth\". New non-fermentable sugar-replacing substrates are being developed. Their utilization in foodstuffs and sweets is being discussed.\n",
      "[Churg-Strauss syndrome. Its nosological place. Apropos of a new case diagnosed before death]. Allergic granulomatous angeitis or Churg and Strauss disease, seems to form part of the disease of necrotising angeitis. Clinically, it may be considered when periarteritis nodosa is associated with asthma and marked eosinophilia. The diagnosis depends on the pathological findings including the venous and pulmonary lesions, giant cells and the presence of extra-vascular granulomas. The recognition of this disease does not, however, permit one to give a precise prognosis. In the absence of progress concerning the pathogenesis, treatment will be the same as that given in other forms of necrotising angeitis.\n",

      "Nonsurgical control of massive acute gastric mucosal hemorrhage with antacid neutralization of gastric content. A simple and safe method of medical treatment for control of massive acute gastric mucosal hemorrhage is described. The procedure was developed from the observation that gastric HCl played a central role in peretuating the syndrome. The treatment consists in neutralization of the gastric acid with antacid to pH of 7.0. In preliminary observations of consecutive admissions, 19 of 20 (95 per cent) patients treated with this techinique stopped bleeding. The one remaining patient required surgery. There were no deaths. In contrast, 10 of 15 (66 per cent) patients stopped bleeding with conventional medical therapy. Four of the remaining patients required surgery to control the bleeding. One patient did not stop on medical management. All five (33 per cent) patients died.\n",
      "Effect of total gastrectomy on acid proteolytic zymogens in serum and urine. Proteolytic pH-activity curve and agar gel electrophoretic pattern of acid proteolytic zymogens in serum and urine were studied in totally gastrectomized patients. In serum, total gastrectomy was found to reduce proteolytic activity markedly, but no appreciable changes could be detected by electrophoretic analysis. In urine, however, in addition to the marked reduction of proteolytic activity, changes were found in electrophoretic pattern after total gastrectomy. Namely, fraction Pg 3 tended to persist, while Pg 5 disappeared along with the lapse of time after total gastrectomy. An unusual appearance of fraction Pg 7 in urine was also observed on the occasion of postoperative transient albuminuria. Their orgins and related clinical problems were discussed.\n",
      "[Pollen diet as an adjuvans of radiotherapy in gynecologic carcinomas]. The introduction of a pollen diet as an adjuvant in the reduction of side effects during radiotherapy of patients with gynaecological cancer is described and its efficacy evaluated. 15 women with carcinoma of the cervix received a pollen diet during irradiation, whilst ten further patients receiving irradiation served as controls without pollen added to the diet. Serum enzymes, proteins, vitamins and blood count were analysed before and after irradiation. It appears, that pollen favourably influences the efficacy of irradiation and reduces the frequency of side effects, both subjectively and objectively.\n",
      "[Effects of lethal overexposure on gastric secretion in the pig]. The characteristics of gastric secretion following acute gamma exposure (1500 rd) were studied in pigs with a small Pavlov stomach. Spontaneous secretion was practically inhibited when the animals were taken out of the irradiation cell. It slowly recovered in the following hours and its pH, first neutral, turned acid again. However, till the third day, it did not recover normal characteristics. The excretion of sodium ions was much increased. Under histaminic stimulation, the responses of irradiated pigs and controls were much similar. The secretory capacities of the gastric mucosa were retained but without spontaneous manifestations. As a conclusion, the early troubles following overexposure must be the consequences of regulation disorders rather than of the direct action of radiation on the stomach.\n",
      "A study of the host selection patterns of the mosquitoes of the Kisumu area of Kenya. The results of 12,168 precipitin tests on blood meals of mosquitoes of the Kano Plain caught by a variety of catching techniques indicate that to gain an accurate overall picture of feeding patterns both the indoor and the outdoor biotope must be sampled. CDC light traps operated inside houses and Monkswood type light traps operated under the outside eaves of houses were found to collect larger numbers of blood fed specimens from a wider range of species than battery driven aspirators collecting from natural resting sites. The results indicated that 7 mosquito species entered houses to bite man in appreciable numbers in the Kisumu area. These were Anopheles gambiae s.l., A. funestus, A. pharoensis, Mansonia uniformia, M. africana, Culex antennatus, and C. univittatus. Eight mosquito species were found to bite man and domestic animals in the outdoor biotope in large numbers. These were: A. pharoensis, A. ziemanni, M. uniformis, M. africana, C. antennatus, C. univittatus, Aedes circumluteolus, and Ae. ochraceus. From an epidemiological point of view, species with a narrow range of hosts are most likely to be of importance as vectors of parasitic diseases such as malaria and into this category fall the major man biting anophelines A. gambiae and A. funestus. Those mosquito species which switch from one group of hosts to another according to local circumstances are most likely to be involved in arbovirus transmission and in this group the following species must be considered: A. pharoensis, A. ziemanni, M. uniformia, M. africana, C. antennatus, C. univittatus and Ae. circumluteolus.\n",
      "The host component of the graft-versus-host reaction. A study on the popliteal lymph node reaction in the rat. I have measured the proportion of host cells in a popliteal lymph node undergoing a graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction. By using cytotoxic alloantisera with specificity for donor and host Ag-B determined antigens, it was found that about 90% of live cells suspended from the node were of host origin. The role of host T lymphocytes in this reaction was evaluated by investigating GVH-reactivity in hosts depleted of T cells (B rats). These rats differed very little from normal hosts with regard to lymph node weight increase (which was, in fact, slightly enhanced), increase in node cellularity, and donor/host contribution. The number of i.v. infused 51Cr-labelled thoracic duct lymphocytes localizing in popliteal lymph nodes undergoing a GVH-reaction was increased, but the significance of this phenomenon for the lymph node enlargement is questionable.\n",
      "Arboviruses isolated from mosquitos and man in Surinam. In the capital of Surinam, and in parts of the coastal plain and the savannah belt 47 strains of arbovirus were isolated from mosquito pools and from sentinel mice. Most of the strains (51%) were of the Mucambo type. The other types were Guama, Bimiti, Una, Catu, Restan, Maru, and Kwatta. Culex portesi was found to be the principal vector of all but one (Maru) types. Other vectors found to be carriers of arboviruses were Psorophora ferox, Mansonia venezuelensis, and Aëdes serratus. The highest proportion of mosquito pools yielding arboviruses was found in the savannah belt, the lowest in the municipality of Paramaribo.\n",
      "The use of pluronic polyols in the precipitation of plasma proteins and its application in the preparation of plasma derivatives. Pluronic F-38 was used a precipitant of plasma proteins under varying conditions of pH and polymer concentration. Results indicated that marked differences in the solubility of the plasma proteins in F-38 solutions can be appled to the separation of plasma components. The feasibility of the industrial application of this fractionation method was tested in several experiments. Conditions were established for the preparation of albumin, human plasma protein fraction (HPPF), and immune serum globulin (ISG) with similar yield and purity as those prepared by the Cohn methods. Current procedures for the preparation of antihemophilic A (Facor VIII) concentrate and prothrombin complex (Factors II, VII, IX, and X) were adapted to the F-38 process by removal of the clotting factors from the starting plasma prior to polymer precipitation. In addition, a plasma protein solution free of lipoproteins, isoagglutinins, and clotting factors was developed which has proven useful as a perfusion medium in organ preservation.\n",
      "Preparation and storage of platelet concentrates. A technique of platelet concentrate preparation and storage is presented which permits the maximum number of viable and functional platelets to be preserved for periods of 72 hours. Although the storage conditions must be followed precisely, the method is nevertheless simple to perform and does not require specialized expensive equipment. Critical factors include: 1) preparation of the platelet concentrates with an initial centrifugation of 1000 X g for 9 minutes and a second centrifugation of 3000 X g for 20 minutes (86% +/- 1 platelet yield), 2) a storage bag composed of either Fenwal's PL-146 or McGaw plastic, 3) constant gentle mixing, 4) a 70 ml residual plasma volume, and 5) room temperature storage (22 C +/- 2). In Vivo platelet recovery after 72 hours of storage at room temperature averaged 46 per cent +/- 3 and survival was 7.9 days +/- 0.3 (81% of fresh platelet viability). The function of these platelets as measured by the correlation between bleeding time and platelet count after transfusion of pooled platelets into unimmunized, aplastic thrombocytopenic recipients was as good as that of fresh platelets. Both viability and function of concentrated platelets stored at 4 C are severely compromised.\n",
      "[Polysome ribonucleases of leukemic cells]. The composition of ribosomal proteins isolated from normal homopoietic and leucemic cells was studied by analytic electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. It was found that acid-soluble proteins from polysomal complexes can be separated into 21-22 components in the acid system. There was no significant differences in protein components from normal and leucemic polysomes by their quantity and mobility in polyacrylamide gel. Five protein components possess a ribonuclease activity as it was established by using technique of direct RNase assay in electrophoregrams. All ribonuclease-active components have pH optimum at 7.6-7.8. No differences were detected in the number and activity of particular enzyme components of polysomes isolated from normal hemopoietic and leucemic tissues. It is suggested that the number and presence of RNases in polysome complexes is likely to play not a significant role in regulation of polysome activity, but influence of inhibitors makes this supposition possible.\n",

Studied were bacteriologically a total of 114 birds affected with acute Marek's disease (40 broilers, 44 growing layers, and 30 adult layers) as well as 100 healthy control birds of the same three categories. A chemical analysis was performed of the red and white meat of 20 of the diseased pullets and 20 of the diseased adult layers as well as of 34 of the affected broilers. The investigation included the same numbers of the control birds. Extractions of the sampled meat were studied in terms of catalase number, pH value, and peroxydase activity. It was found that enterobacteria in the viscera of the diseased birds were three to nine times more frequently encountered than in the same organs of the controls. In two cases Salmonella bacteria were also isolated from the affected chickens. In three cases there were enterobacteria in the red musculature of these birds. The meat of the diseased birds had higher water content, higher catalase number and pH value, with lower contents of proteins, fats, and mineral matter. The only exception was the red meat of these birds which had higher content of crude protein as compared with the red meat of the normal birds.\n",

An enzymatic activity of shuttle systems for reduction equivalents transport (malate-aspartate, glycerophosphate, lactate, glutamate and beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) was studied spectrophotometrically in liver tissue of intact rabbits and animals with experimental atherosclerosis. Content of malate, oxaloacetate, glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, alpha-glycerophosphate, dihydroacetone phosphate, lactate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were studied. In experimental atherosclerosis coordinated functioning of the enzymes, which participate in the utilization of the cytoplasmic NAD-H2 and the alteration in the ratio of reduced and oxidized metabolites in the systems, were found to be impaired.\n",
      "[The specificity of galactokinase induction in rat liver tissue under the effect of galactose]. In liver tissue of rats, a conventional laboratory food of which was substituted for galactose-rich food, the galactokinase activity was increased, but the glucokinase was not affected. In the rats kept on a glucose-rich food the glucokinase (but not the galactokinase) was activated. Hydrocortisone injection induced an increase in tyrosine aminotransferase, but the galactokinase activity was not altered. The data obtained suggest that in rat liver tissue the galactokinase was specifically induced under the effect of galactose. Except for the liver tissue, galactose induced galactokinase in eye crystalline lens; the enzyme activity was not altered in spleen and kidney.\n",
      "[Age-related properties of inductive synthesis of glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, tyrosine aminotransferase and tryptophan pyrrolase in hypothalamus stimulation]. In aged rats electrostimulation of hypothalamus caused less distinct induction of the enzymes in liver tissue, kidney and spleen as compared with the adult animals. The activation of the total RNA synthesis (actinomycin D and olivomycin) eliminated the alterations in the enzymatic activities, caused by the stimulation of hypothalamus. Effect of adrenalectomy and administration of ACTH suggested that the influence of the hypothalamus stimulation on induction of the enzymes studied was realized through the system hypophysis -- adrenal cortex. In the aged animals activation of adrenal cortex was less distinct when the stimulation of hypothalamus was carried out. The alterations in hypothalamic regulation of the enzyme induction could be an important mechanism in regulation of adaptive reactions in aged organisms.\n",
      "[Determination of the transferase activity of L-asparaginase]. A method for determination of the transferase activity of 1-asparaginase in presence of hydroxylamine is developed. The optimally determined quantity of the enzyme was from 0.7 to 20 i. u. The conditions optimal for the enzymatic reaction and for quantitative estimation of 1-aspartyl-beta-hydroxamic acid were studied. The transferase and hydrolase activities of 1-asparaginase from E. coli were compared. The enzyme catalyzed at equal rates hydrolysis and hydroxylaminolysis of 1-asparagine.\n",
      "[The effect of lipids from typhoid endotoxin on the activity of some liver enzymes]. Sublethal doses of typhoid endotoxin distinctly increased the activities of glutamate dehydrogenase and histidine ammonium lyase in liver tissue of mice within 3 hrs and the tyrosine transaminase activity within 6 hrs after a single intraperitoneal administration. Within 24 hrs normalzation of these enzyme activities and a decrease in the urocaninase activity were observed in liver tissue. Lipid A, obtained from the endotoxin, activated glutamate dehydrogenase and histidine ammonium lyase, inhibited urocaninase but did not affect the tyrosine transaminase activity. Lipid B, isolated by a non-hydrolytic method, showed even wore distinct capacity to activate glutamate dehydrogenase and histidine ammonium lyase, but did not alter the activities of tyrosine transaminase and urocaninase in liver tissue.\n",
      "[Purification and properties of myeloperoxidase from mice leukocytes]. Myeloperoxidase from leucocytes of peritoneal exudate was isolated by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, CM-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The preparation obtained was homogenous as shown by repeated gel filtration and ultracentrifugation. The enzyme was purified 302-fold, with 16% yield. The sedimentation constant was equal to 4.05 S. Molecular weight of the enzyme, determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, constituted 135,000 daltons. Myeloperoxidase had two pH optima of activity--at pH 4.6 and at pH 7.6. Km for o-dianizidine was equal to 4.0-10(-3)M and for hydrogen peroxide--to 1.65-10(-4)M. Myeloperoxidase of mice leucocytes differed from the enzymes of leucocytes from other animal species in its distinctly lower sedimentation constant and thermolability.\n",
      "[Changes in oxidative systems of liver microsomes in rats following a single administration of phenobarbital and morphine]. During the first three hours after a single administration of phenobarbital or morphine into rats a marked increase was observed in the activity and content of the respiratory chain components responsible for the oxidation of NAD-H2 and NADP-H2 in liver microsomes. This activation of oxidative enzymes correlated with the disappearance of hypnotic and analgetic effects of the narcotics. The phase following the normalization of oxydative systems was characterized by the increase of microsomal enzymes level. This is related to their specific induction only by phenobarbital.\n",
      "[Isolation and properties of 2 kallikreins from human saliva]. Two kallikreins (K-I and K-II) were purified from mixed, parotid and submandibular human saliva. The kallikreins were separated by chromatography on CM-cellulose. The pH optima of activity were at pH 9.3 and pH 9.6-9.8; Km for BAEE was 1.10-3M and 4.10-3M, respectively. The esterase activity of K-I and K-II was inhibited by trasylol-like inhibitors, while the plant and synthetic inhibitors of trypsin were uneffective. In dog, rabbit and rat the hypotensive effect of K-II and its action upon the permeability of rabbit skin was 4-5 fold higher than the effects of K-I. Ki and K-II did not alter the arterial blood pressure in guinea pig.\n",
      "[The correlation between activity of enzymes participating in the formation and utilization of acetyl CoA in rabbit heart mitochondria in myocarditis and normal state]. Activities in rabbit heart mitochondria of acetoacetyl-CoA-thyolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetyl CoA-synthetase, citrate synthase and acetyl carnitine transferase were compared. These enzymes participate in formation and utilization of acetyl-CoA. The acetoacetyl-CoA-thyolase and acetyl CoA-synthetase were shown to possess the more distinct capacity in vitro to form acetyl CoA. The co-enzyme was most efficiently utilized under these experimental conditions by the citrate synthase. The enzymes studied were localized within the mitochondria fraction in both the subfractions of soluble and membrane-bound proteins. In myocarditis a distinct decrease in activities of the acetoacetyl-CoA-thyolase and citrate synthase was observed.\n",
      "[New values for the molar extinction coefficients of NADH and NADPH for the use in routine laboratories (author's transl)]. Extensive re-investigations with regard to the molar extinction coefficients of NADH and NADPH proved that in future, calculations in routine work can be performed with the following much more accurate epsilon-values: 6.15 x 10(3) 1 x mol-1 x cm-1 at Hg 334 nm (NADH and NADPH), 6.3 X 10(3) 1 X mol-1 x cm-1 at 340 nm (NADH and NADPH), 3.4 X 10(3) 1 X mol-1 X Cm-1 (NADH) and 3.5 x 10(3) 1 x mol-1 x cm-1 (NADPH) at Hg 365 nm, respectively. The safest measurement is performed at Hg 334 nm, because here epsilon is identical for both coenzymes and deviations of the epsilon-value caused by temperature, pH and ionic strength are less than 0.5%.\n",

The delta4-3-oxosteroid-5 alpha-reductase in liver microsomes was studied intensively and it was found that it is an enzyme system. The 5 alpha-reduction of testosterone with NADPH or with NADH depends upon different enzymes or enzyme systems.\n",
      "[An improved trihydroxyindole method for the determination of urinary catecholamines]. Commercially available columns for ion exchange chromatography were used for the separation of catecholamines in urine. The estimation of catecholamines was performed fluorimetrically by a new trihydroxyindole method. The fluorescence of adrenaline or noradrenaline was enhanced, in comparison with other methods, by the combined application of boric acid, copper-ions, mercaptoethanol and final reacidification. The fluorophores are stable: The loss of fluorescence of adrenolutin amounted to 22% during 180 minutes, and there was no loss of noradrenolutin. For the differentiation of amines, adrenaline was oxidized at pH 2.85 and noradrenaline at pH 7. Precision, accuracy, sensitivity and specifity fulfilled the criteria of analysis. The normal values, determined in a collective of 17 healthy persons, were adrenaline (x +/- s) 44.8 +/- 16.9 nmol/24 h and noradrenaline (x +/- s) 224.0 +/- 68.0 nmol/24h. The simultaneous application of alpha-methyldopa (2 g/day) in 13 patients with primary hypertension did not disturb the fluorimetric estimation of catecholamines.\n",
      "[Biochemical investigations of cancer cachexia. II. Depletion of glycogenolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis in Walker carcinoma 256 bearing rats (author's transl)]. 150-200 g heavy, Walker-carcinoma bearing, male Sprague-Dawley-rats showed rapid, tumour weight dependent, loss of liver glycogen until complete depletion in tumour groups heavier than 40 g/animal. Simultaneously the glycogen mobilization after massive glucagon stimulation, was successivly diminished and finally abolished in different groups with increasing tumor weight. Concomitantly the spontaneous and stimulated activity of liver phosphorylase a was found markedly reduced in advanced tumour cachexia, the extent of stimulation of liver phosphorylase a activity by intracardial injections of epinephrine not being altered. Tumour induced inhibition of glycogen mobilization thus appears to have been excluded. To account for the relative late pronounced hypoglycemia in peripherial rat blood in face of the early loss of liver glycogen, accelerated gluconeogenesis has been postulated. In accord with this spontaneous rise in liver tyrosine amino transferase was found in tumour bearing rats along with a doubled maximal stimulation value after medrol injection as compared to control groups. This behavior could not be shown for liver alanine aminotransferase and liver fructose 1,6-di-phosphatase. The former showed no differences between control and tumour groups neither of spontaneous nor of stimulated activity. The latter showed only a very reluctant rise after massive stimulation by triamcinolone for 3 days in the control groups, the tumour bearing groups showing no deviation from spontaneous control values.\n",
      "Oxidative decarboxylation of para-hydroxybenzoic acids by peroxidases under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Oxidative decarbyxylation of p-hydroxybenzoic acids in plant cell suspension cultures is catalyzed by peroxidases. This reaction has been characterized in vivo and in vitro. Decarboxylation of substituted benzoic acids yields monomeric, dimeric and oligomeric benzoquinones. All peroxidases obtained from soybean (Glycine max) cell suspension cultures by gel electrophoresis are equally capable to decarboxylate p-hydroxygenzoic acids as indicated by their rather low differences in specific activity for various benzoic acids.\n",
      "The regulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in chloroplasts. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from intact pea chloroplasts is partially membrane bound and inactivated upon illumination. The inhibitory effect of light can be abolished by addition of methylviologen. Kinetic experiments with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reveal that, in the dark, the enzyme activity is strongly inhibited by the accumulation of NADPH. The inhibition of NADPH can be reversed by the addition of excess NADP+. The non-Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics suggest that the enzyme is stringently regulated by the ratio of NADPH to NADP+ plus NADPH, i.e., the \"reduction charge\". These observations seem to indicate that in the light the inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is due to a high reduction charge, whereas in the dark the enzyme is controlled by the metabolic demand for reducing equivalents.\n",
      "Characterization of different deoxyribonucleases in human lymphocytes. Four groups of deoxyribonuclease activities from human lymphocytes have been characterized by deoxyribonuclease assay in DNA-containing polyacrylamide gels following their separation by disc-electrophoresis. All activities hydrolyse DNA endonucleolytically. One neutral deoxyribonuclease found in the cytoplasmic fraction prefers native or UV-irradiated DNA over denatured DNA as substrate and is a 5'-monoester former. Two groups of acid deoxyribonuclease activities are detectable in the nuclear fraction. Both are 3'-monoester formers. One is as well active with denatured DNA as with native DNA, the other one shows the same activity with native and UV-irradiated DNA but lower activity with denatured DNA. An alkaline deoxyribonuclease activity, also localized in the nucleus, is a 5'-monoester former, and prefers denatured or UV-irradiated DNA as substrate.\n",
      "Studies on fragments of rod outer segments from bovine retinas. Monolayers of fragments of our rod segments were formed at an air-water interface. The area of these particles was measured as a function of the pH of the aqueous phase. A maximum area was measured at pH 6.5. The film was characterised by measuring the decrease in surface pressure, after compression, and the half time required to reach constant pressure. At a pH between 6 and 7 the decrease in surface pressure was a minimum. Irradiation of films of fragments resulted in a decrease in surface potential of between 30 and 40 mV. The largest decrease occured at a pH between 6 and 6.5. A small decrease in surface pressure was also observed upon irradiation. Mixed films of fragments and phosphatidyl ethanolamine were examined. Irradiation of the mixed film resulted in a 70 mV decrease in surface potential.\n",

The pK of formation of the monoanion is 8.6, at 25 degrees C. As formycin B has the same pK value, the ionization of both compounds is ascribed to dissociation of a proton from N-1. Both the neutral and monoanionic forms of oxoformycin are strongly fluorescent.\n",
      "Antagonistic relationships between electron transport and P700 in chloroplasts and intact algae. The effects of divalent salts and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) upon nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) reduction and P700 in isolated chloroplasts are described and compared with the influence of DCMU on oxygen evolution and P700 in intact cells. Most experiments were carried out with a steady-state relaxation spectrometer. A kinetic mechanism for the estimation of P700 fluxes is proposed and experimentally tested. Good agreement between theory and experiment was found. Concurrent measurements of P700 and NADP reduction revealed two antagonisms: addition of divalent cations caused an increase in the yield of NADP reduction and a decrease in the yield of P700. Conversely, in the presence of Mg2+ low concentrations of DCMU decreased the yield of NADP reduction and increased the yield of P700. Aging of the chloroplasts at 30 degrees C exerted a similar effect. With far-red actinic light, Mg2+ stimulated the yield of NADP reduction without affecting the flux. Also, in the absence of Mg2+, DCMU inhibited both reactions although P700 required a higher herbicide concentration for fractional inhibition than NADP reduction. In the presence of Mg2+, chloroplasts resembled intact algae in which a high rate of oxygen evolution was accompanied by little P700 turn-over. Titration with DCMU decreased the rate of photosynthesis and increased P700 flux. On the whole, the data suggest that P700 relaxing in 20 msec is not directly involved in linear electron transport.\n",
      "Energy-linked pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase activity in photosynthetically grown Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Rhodopseudomonas palustris (ATCC 17001) develops energy-dependent NADP+ transhydrogenase activity while growing photosynthetically on thiosulfate, formate, or acetate as the electron donors. The enzymatic activity is present in the supernatant fraction S-144 000. -- As reported, this fraction contains small membrane fragments but no closed vesicles and was shown to drive energy-dependent reversed electron flow as well as an aerobic respiratory electron transport. The energy-dependent transhydrogenase reaction in this fraction can be driven either by ATP, ADP, or inorganic pyrophosphate, but also by acetyl phosphate or acetyl-coenzyme A in the presence of orthophosphate. -- Arsenate acts as an inhibitor and decreases preferentially the acetyl-coenzyme A-dependent and the acetyl phosphate-driven reaction; whereas, oligomycin inhibits preferentially the ATP- and the acetyl phosphate-dependent reactions. -- Acetate kinase and a phosphotransacetylase are operative in S-144 000.\n",
      "[Findings of subpartal monitoring, status of the newborn infant and evaluation of cardiotocographic findings]. The parameters of the intrapartal fetal CTG and the actual pH are related to each other and to the Apgar score of the newborn. The interpretation was carried out by means of groups of 300 to 600 cases. The actual fetal pH has the most compact relation to the Apgar score of the newborn (C equals 0,31). But also this contingence is unsatisfactory. At fetal acidosis most of the Apgar scores are pathological, in that manner the pH is the most important test for indication of operative delivery. The rare CTG pattern as dip II and variable decelerations combined with tachycardia of bradycardia, the bradycardia with 80 bpm or less, are likewise indications of urgent delivery.\n",

Studies have been made on substrate specificity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE;EC 3-1-1-7) from the electric organ of the ray T. marmorata with respect of choline and thiocholine esters, as well as on the effect of pH, salts and organophosphorus inhibitors (OPI) on the activity of the enzyme. Acetylcholine (ACh), propionycholine (PrCh) acetyl-beta-methylcholine (MeCh), acetylthiocholine ((ATCh) and propionylthiocholine (PrTCh) were hydrolyzed by the enzyme studied at the following relative rates-100: 28.8: 18.3: 87.2: 18.9 correspondingly. In all the cases, inhibition of the enzyme by high concentrations of the substrate was observed. As compared to other AChE, the enzyme from T. marmorata exhibits the highest affinity to ACh. For all the substrates studied, pH dependence of AChE activity followed the curve with maximum 7.5 for ACh and PrCh, 8.0-8.5 for ATCh and MeCh and 7.5-8.5 for PrTCh. Various salts (MgCl2), KCl, NaCl, NaBr, KI) increased AChE activity, the increase being the highest with MgCl2 (3.3 times) and NaCl (2.5X). Biomolecular rate constants ((k) II) for the interaction of AChE investigated with OPI containing cationic group-methylsulfomethylates, O-ethyl-S-(beta-ethylmercapto) ethylmethylthiophosphonate and O,O-diethyl-S-(beta-ethylmercapto) ethylthiophosphate, as well as methyl iodide O,O-disopropyl-S-(beta-phenylmethylamino) ethylphosphate-were significantly higher as compared with k(II) values for corresponding compounds without the cation.

      "Preoperative treatment of thyrotoxicosis with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. The clinical usefulness of propranolol as the sole drug in the preoperative treatment of thyrotoxicosis has been investigated. The effect of the drug on the serum levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine has also been studied. Eight consecutive patients were treated. Four of these showed good clinical response to propranolol and both pre- and postoperative periods were uneventful. Two patients also showed a good clinical response but developed accentuated thyrotoxic symptoms in the immediate postoperative period. One patient showed no clinical response to propranolol therapy and in one further patient the treatment was discontinued because of discomfort. All glands were resected without technical difficulty. They were more vascular and friable after this therapy than after pretreatment with antithyroid drugs and thyroxine. The serum levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine decreased during propranolol treatment. It is concluded that treatment with propranolol as a sole preoperative drug might be used as an alternative only in cases where conventional therapy is not suitable.\n",

      "I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II):a report on its pathology. The single most characteristic morphological feature in I-cell disease (ICD) is the accumulation of membrane-bound vacuoles in mesenchymal cells (mainly fibroblasts). No true storage can be documented in those vacuoles. That their contents could have been dissolved during fixation or embedding remains however a possibility. Remnants consisting of a few lamellar arrays and of small amounts of fibrillo-granular material are too scarce for histochemical characterization. In hepatocytes large cells in the white pulp of the spleen and in myocardial fibers, vacuoles with fixative insoluble contents have been discovered; they are nowhere very abundant and their specificity is questionable. Because the affected fibroblastic elements represent a small fraction in any organ, most secondary biochemical abnormalities are expected to be detectable only in purely fibroblastic tissues. Our pathological study contributes to the understanding of some of the clinical features characteristic of ICD and stresses major morphological differences between ICD and the many diseases classified as mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidoses.\n",

      "[Effect of an anxiolytic agent in hay fever]. In a group of 55 allergic patients with hay fever, and including patients treated by complete placebo, the action of Lorazepam has been studied from both the psycho-somatic and the allergic point of view. This most obviously allergic of all allergic diseases has been especially chosen because it was thought that the psycho-somatic hypothesis would appear at the outset in this condition to be the less apparent. Despite this fact, the anxiolitic effect of Lorazepam and its anti-allergic consequences were conclusive. A parallel study using only placebo treatment, orally and by vaccine, was performed in a few cases. 39 patients out of 45 treated by Temesta and placebo vaccine, had few or very few allergic symptoms. The 10 patients treated by complete placebo (orally and by vaccine) presented this year an acute pollinosis. We find the same parallelism between the allergy and the psycho-somatic aspect.\n",
      "A case of methylmalonic and propionic acidemia due to methulmalonyl-CoA carbonylmutase apoenzyme deficiency. A patient presenting with a deep metabolic acidosis after birth is described. Gas chromatographic analysis of short chain fatty acid and non volatile organic acids revealed the presence of both propionic and methylmalonic acid. In plasma obtained immediately after death the propionic- and methylmalonic acid concentrations were measured after separation of both acids by thin layer chromatography. The propionic acid concentration was about 5 mM while the methylmalonic acid concentration was 2.6 mM. The methylmalonic acid concentration in urine was 6.8 mM. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity measured in leucocytes and liver-mitochondria revealed normal values (53 pmoles/min/mg protein and 6.5 nmoles/min/mg protein respectively). 2-14C-Methyl-malonate oxydation in intact fibroblasts was totally blocked in the patient's cells.

      "Survival of anaerobic bacteria during transportation. 1. Experimental investigations on the effect of evacuation of atmospheric air by flushing with carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The effect of evacuation of atmospheric air during transportation on recovery of anaerobic bacteria was investigated. Evacuation of atmospheric air from glass tubes by flushing with pure carbon dioxide lowered the content of oxygen to about 0.4 per cent. Three B. fragilis strains and one strain of Fusobacterium mortiferum and of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were investigated. Bacterial recovery was determined one hour and 24 hours after evacuation of atmospheric air by pure carbon dioxide and pure nitrogen, was compared to bacterial recovery from samples transported with free access to atmospheric air. Evacuation by pure carbon dioxide significantly improved the recovery of one B. fragilis strain after 24 hours of transportation and significantly impaired the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after one hour of transportation, while evacuation by pure nitrogen significantly improved the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after 24 hours of transportation. In all other cases, however, no statistically significant effect on bacterial recovery was found.\n",
      "The spread of the action potential through the T-system in hagfish twitch muscle fibres. The input impedance of twitch muscle fibres of the Atlantic hagfish has been measured with sinusoidal transmembrane currents. The apparent specific membrane resistance and capacitance decreased markedly with frequency, and were relatively independent of fibre diameter. A model of the T-system based on anatomical observations, was used to predict the input impedance in the normal solution (artificial sea water). The changes in input impedance produced by glycerol treatment, low chloride solution, reduced pH and isotonic solutions with low ionic strength were easily interpreted in terms of the same model. The model predicts severe attenuation of the action potential if conducted electrotonically by the transverse tubules towards the center of the fibre.\n",
      "Withdrawal psychosis: a study of 30 consecutive cases. A study was carried out of 30 consecutive patients with withdrawal psychosis who in the period 1972 to 1975 were admitted to a psychiatric department or were attended by the department while hospitalized in a somatic department. There was a clear majority of women among cases of psychosis following drug withdrawal (15 as against four) and a clear majority of men among cases of psychosis following alcohol withdrawal (nine as against two). Competing pathogenetic factors could be considered present in most cases in the last mentioned group. In most cases the abrupt cessation took place in conjunction with admission to hospital, most frequently surgical cases or cases of acute drug toxication. In other cases abrupt cessation was decided upon by the patient himself. Frequently predelirium treatment was either omitted or was given in the form of neuroleptics. Approximately a quarter of the patients initially denied their abuse. The study indicates that withdrawal psychosis can make its debut or become manifest at so late a stage as about the 14th day of the withdrawal phase following use of benzodiazepines and d-propoxiphene. It is further indicated that abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines taken in \"therapeutic\" doses for several years in some instances can give rise to a withdrawal psychosis.\n",
      "Nephroangiography in Wegener's granulumatosis. A comparison with panarteritis nodosa. Three cases of Wegener's granulomatosis with a classical course are described, 2 of which with fatal outcome in spite of immuno-suppressive therapy. Nephroangiography was performed during the oliguric or anuric phase. The appearances were similar to those encountered in glomerulonephritis and were compared with those in three cases of panarteritis nodosa. Two of these represented the classical form with intrarenal arterial aneurysms; the third was a case of the microscopic type presenting blurred intrarenal arteries with lumen variations and occlusions. These observations support the opinion that Wegener's granulomatosis nodosa are different diseases. Nephroangiography seems to be of value in their differentiation.\n",

Metoprolol, a new selective adrenergic beta1-receptor blocking drug, has been compared to placebo in a series of 24 women who previously had taken alprenolol and propranolol during a cross-over study. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were significantly reduced during metoprolol treatment compared to placebo. The occurrence of side-effects was similar during treatment with metoprolol and placebo. After the cross-over study the patients continued on metoprolol for more than two years, except for short periods on placebo or propranolol. During this follow-up period BP remained at a similar level when the metoprolol dose was unchanged. Dose reduction (from 50 or 100 mg t.i.d. to 50 or 100 mg b.i.d.) caused no, or only a very slight, increase in BP. No side-effects were reported during long-term treatment.\n",

      "Effects of metabolic and pharmacologic interventions on myocardial infarct size following coronary occlusion. A number of hemodynamic, pharmacologic and metabolic interventions were found to change the extent of acute ischemic injury of the myocardium and subsequent necrosis following experimental coronary artery occlusion. Reduction in myocardial damage occurred by decreasing myocardial oxygen demands (beta-adrenergic blocking agents, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, external counterpulsation, nitroglycerin, decreasing afterload in hypertensive patients, inhibition of lipolysis, and digitalis in the failing heart); by increasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (coronary artery reperfusion or elevating arterial pO2),  or through collateral vessels (elevation of coronary perfusion pressure by alpha-adrenergic agonists, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation); or by increasing plasma osmolality (mannitol, hypertonic glucose); presumably by augmenting anaerobic metabolism (glucose-insulin-potassium, hypertonic glucose); by enhancing transport to the ischemic zone of substrates utilized in energy production (hyaluronidase); by protecting against autolytic and heterolytic damage (hydrocortisone, cobra venom factor, aprotinin). Augmentation of myocardial ischemic damage occurred as a consequence of increasing myocardial oxygen requirements (isoproterenol, glucagon, ouabain, bretylium tosylate, tachycardia); by decreasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (hypoxia, anemia) or through reduction of collateral flow (hemorrhagic hypotension, minoxidil) or by decreasing substrate availability glycemia). Pilot studies have been carried out in patients with hyaluronidase, nitroglycerin, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, beta-blocking agents and Arfonad and have shown that these interventions may also reduce myocardial damage, suggesting that the concept of reduction in infarct size following coronary occlusion is applicable clinically.\n",
      "Factors of importance for the degree of ischemic injury in the isolated rat heart. Isolated working rat hearts were made ischemic by introducing a one-way aortic ball valve. After the ischemic period the hearts were perfused in a retrograde non-working way for 30 min. Flow rates, glycogen, ATP, and creatine-phosphate went down during the time of ischemia, whereas tissue lactate accumulated. For shorter periods of ischemia these values were normalized but after 30 min of ischemia the hearts seemed to be irreversibly damaged. There was a leakage of GOT, GPT, LDH, and CPK from all hearts when ischemic from 5 to 30 min. Different factors that might be of importance for the degree of ischemic injury were tested. The injury tended to be more severe at higher heart rates. Addition of adrenaline 10(-6)M resulted in excessive myocardial damage. A variation of pH from 7.1 to 7.7 did not alter the effects of the ischemic injury. One group of rats were injected with adrenaline for 8 weeks to simulate chronic stress. When hearts from these rats were made ischemic they were more prone to fail compared to controls. The failing hearts, on the other hand, had a lower leakage of enzymes, possibly due to a less severe myocardial damage. A high mechanical performance and a normal noradrenaline content of the hearts are key factors for the development of myocardial infarction, as indicated by this study.\n",
      "Double-blind study of the effect of cardioselective beta-blockade on chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. A double-blind study including three different cardioselective beta-blockers, practolol, H 87/07 and metoprolol, was performed in 54 patients with acute myocardial infarction and chest pain shortly after onset of symptoms. Transmural infarctions were found in 42 patients while 12 patients had nontransmural infarctions. Chest pain and the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in the beta-blocker groups whereas no changes were seen after saline. All patients with nontransmural infarctions and 14 out of 29 with transmural infarctions got pain relief lasting for at least 30 min. None of the patients developed signs of left ventricular backward failure, shock, or bradycardia. A decrease in ST segment elevation was observed in all the transmural infarctions after beta-blockade. No changes in ST segment elevation were found after analgesics when given after saline, but in some cases an increase was seen in this parameter when analgesics were given due to insufficient pain relief after beta-blockers or due to return of chest pain. It is suggested that pain relief by beta-blockers indicates decrease of myocardial ischemia.\n",
      "Multiple endocrine adenomatosis syndromes. MEA I and II are two genetically distinct tumor endocrinopathies, both showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Little overlap exists between these conditions, and that which is present can be explained on the basis of two mutually exclusive factors: (1) the secondary consequences of hormone excess on another endocrine gland or (2) the fact that both tumor syndromes appear to result from genetically faulty differentiation of neuroectoderm. A seemingly disproportionate amount of effort has been expended on study of the MEA syndromes. However, there would seen to be ample justification for this interest: 1) The MEA syndromes, unlike most neoplastic conditions, are hereditary and can be readily detected and more expeditiously treated; 2) hormone radioimmunoassay has greatly facilitated diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals; and (3) probably most importantly, study of these syndromes has provided considerable insight into the embryologic origin of the endocrine system. It is conceivable that knowledge gained from these conditions may stimulate further inquiry into the processes whereby neoplasia occurs in endocrine tissue and thus lead the way to the development of effective therapy for a host of hormone-producing tumors.\n",
      "Folic acid absorption in regional enteritis. The authors have investigated intestinal absorption of folic acid by jejunal perfusion with a triple lumen tube in five subjects with regional enteritis. The subjects' intestinal disabilities ranged from terminal ileitis to short bowel syndrome. Two had steatorrhea and two had low serum folate levels. Absorption of pteroylglutamic acid was normal in all five. This suggests that folic acid deficiency, common in this disorder, is largely caused by malnutrition, not malabsorption.\n",
      "Acid, neutral, and alkaline hydrolases in arthritic synovium. The levels of six lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase, beta-acetylglucosaminidase, cathepsin D, beta-galactosidase, arylsulfatase A, and beta-glucuronidase) and four neutral and alkaline hydrolases (esterase, inorganic phyrophosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and 5'-nucleotidase) were measured in osteoarthritic, rheumatoid and control synovia. All enzyme levels in diseased synovium except esterase values in osteoarthritis were significantly elevated compared with controls. The mean values of the group of acid hydrolases and the group of neutral and alkaline hydrolases in osteoarthritic synovia were 1.9- and 2.0-fold greater than those of control specimens. In rheumatoid synovia, the values were 4.2- and 4.5 fold greater than control for the same enzymes. Levels in rheumatoid synovia were significantly higher than those in osteoarthritic synovia with the exception of 5'-nucleotidase. Only a limited correlation between the extents of inflammation present in the synovia and the levels of a lysosomal marker enzyme (cathepsin D) was observed. These results demonstrate that whatever the mechanism, increased levels of acid hydrolases as well as certain neutral and alkaline hydrolases are present in osteoarthritic and rheumatoid synovia, and these enzymes are probably contained in the synovial lining cells.\n",
      "Effects of acute metabolic acidosis on parathyroid hormone action and calcium mobilization. Mechanisms through which metabolic acidosis increases calcium mobilization have been investigated in thyroparathyroidectomized rats with induction of acute metabolic acidosis by infusing NH4C1 intravenously. Acute metabolic acidosis directly raised serum calcium concentration and augmented the effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to raise serum calcium concentration. The same effects of metabolic acidosis were observed in rats with surgically removed intestines and bilateral nephrectomy, suggesting that acute metabolic acidosis directly increases calcium mobilization from bone and augments the effect of PTH to mobilize calcium from bone. In the kidney, acidosis directly inhibited the tubular reabsorption of calcium, but augmented the effect of PTH to increase tubular reabsorption of calcium. Acidosis had no measurable effect on calcitonin action.\n",
      "Metabolism of histamine in secreting and isolated canine stomach. Total 14C activity in juice secreted by gastric pouches of six dogs and seven isolated canine stomachs was determined in response to intravenous and intra-arterial infusions of histamine and [14C]histamine. The proportions of 14C attributable to histamine, Nalpha-methylhistamine (NalphaMeH), Nalpha,Nalpha-dimethylhistamine (NalphaNalphaMe2H), N-telle-methylhistamine (NtauMeH), imidazole acetic acid (ImAA), N-methylimidazole acetic acid (NtauMeImAA), acetylhistamine (AcH), and histaminol (HOH) were defined using thin-layer chromatography. Similar estimates were made at the end of infusions on blood, gastric mucosa, and gastric muscle. Methylation was the major, or sole, route of metabolism of histamine in the gastric mucosa, and the major product was inactive NtauMeH. Small quantities of the active NalphaMe derivatives, particularly NalphaNalphaMe2H, were identified in both the juice and mucosa. Little or no ImAA, NtauMeImAA, AcH, and HOH were present in juice from isolated stomachs while they did occur in the juice from intact dogs, demonstrating they are extragastric metabolites of histamine. A major mucosal function of methylation of histamine is inactivation, although NalphaMe derivatives formed may play a role in the secretagogue action of histamine.\n",
      "Intracellular bicarbonate of skeletal muscle under different metabolic states. Intracellular bicarbonate of single muscle fibers in vivo was measured by a direct electrometric method simultaneously with the membrane PD in rats under seven different metabolic states. From the measured intracellular bicarbonate values and the PCO2, the bicarbonate equilibrium potential and the intracellular pH were calculated. The mean intracellular [HCO3-] under normal control conditions was 10.3 +/- 0.7 mM (SE). The intracellular bicarbonate fell significantly in both chronic metabolic acidosis and chronic K+ depletion. In contrast, intracellular bicarbonate was elevated in chronic metabolic alkalosis, K+ loading, and Na+ depletion. Taking intracellular pH as an index of the acid-base status of cells, we find that whereas the calculated cell pH decreased along with the cell bicarbonate in both chronic metabolic acidosis and K+ depletion, cell pH increased along with the bicarbonate only in chronic metabolic alkalosis. Cell pH was unchanged in both chronic K+ loading and Na+ depletion.\n",
      "Effect of acid lumen pH on potassium transport in renal cortical collecting tubules. In order to determine the effect of acid lumen pH on renal tubular potassium transport, cortical collecting tubules were dissected from rabbit kidneys and perfused in vitro. When the pH of the perfusate was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8, potassium secretion into the tubule lumen decreased by an average of 47%. The transepithelial voltage increased from a mean value of -32 mV (lumen negative) at pH 7.4 to -51 mV at PH 6.8. Net sodium absorption from the tubule lumen was essentially unchanged (5% mean decrease). Transepithelial voltage and potassium secretion returned to control values when the pH of the perfusate was raised to 7.4. Alterations in pH of the bath had no comparable effect on the transepithelial voltage, whether the bath pH was increased or decreased. We conclude that a decrease in the pH of the tubule fluid of itself inhibits active potassium secretion in this tubule segment, providing an additional explanation for the decrease in potassium excretion found in acidosis. The negative voltage (presumably caused by sodium absorption out of the lumen) is increased under these conditions, possibly because of reduction of a smaller counterbalancing positive voltage caused by potassium secretion into the lumen.\n",
      "Reflex sympathetic tachycardia during intravenous infusions in chronic spinal cats. The reflex tachycardia elicited by rapid intravenous infusions of a blood substitute was studied in 21 chronic cats with spinal sections at C8. All animals could breath spontaneously. The day after section the average resting heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure (AP) were 109 beats/min and 98/67 mmHg, respectively. Vagal blockade with atropine (0.5-0.7 mg/kg iv) was performed prior to each infusion, increasing the average HR To 127 beats/min. In 39 infusions in 21 cats the average increase in HR was 10 beats/min (range from -6 to +22 beats/min). A tachycardia was observed in all but five trials, four of which were obtained in two cats that subsequently responded with a tachycardia. In seven animals the neural circuit mediating the response was partially or totally interrupted by section of several thoracic dorsal roots (T1-T4 or T1-T6) and of the spinal cord at the inferior level of these sections (between T6 and T7). The tachycardia response was progressively reduced and finally abolished by these procedures. These experiments indicate that spinal neural mechanisms are likely to contribute to the phenomenon first described by Bainbridge.\n",
      "Sudden potential drop in bullfrog gastric mucosa. The previously reported sudden potential drop (SPD), which occurs under anoxia in 10% CO2, has been further explored. We find several conditions necessary for this effect: 1) anoxia; 2) serosal pH less than 7.1;3) presence of chloride; and 4) a PD, either spontaneous or voltage clamped, which changes across the region of 10 mV, serosal positive. With the first three conditions satisfied, a reversible decrease in measured resistance can be produced at will by changing the clamp voltage. In the anoxic, low-resistance state, changes in K+ or C1- concentration give little change in voltage, showing that the increased conductivity is not selective for either ion. A model is proposed containing a shunt-resistance element whose resistance is a step function of PD. This model can mimic the responses of the tissue and provides a working model for the SPD.\n",
      "Cancer of the undescended or maldescended testis. An analysis of 45 cryptorchids (by history or examination) with a testicular cancer treated at Memorial Hospital, between 1934 and 1973, is presented. Twenty-five patients had the cryptorchid state repaired at ages four to 27 years, either spontaneously or by orchiopexy or hormonal therapy. Ipsilateral (24) or contralateral (one) intrascrotal testis tumors developed four to 47 years later. Twenty cryptorchid patients presented with ipsilateral inguinal (eleven), abdominal (seven), or contralateral intrascrotal (two) tumors. There were 18 pure seminomas, 17 embryonal carcinomas, nine teratocarcinomas, and one reticulum cell sarcoma. Five year survival rates as estimated by the product-limit method were 60% for the unrepaired cases and 41% for the repaired cases. The survival seems to follow histologic type and anatomical stage, whether the testis is within the scrotum or not. Five year survival similarly estimated was 78% in the seminomas and 29% in the other tumors. Twelve of thirteen survivors (including nine with seminoma) received postoperative irradiation to the regional lymphatics and eleven were without recurrent tumor for periods ranging from six to 28 years.\n",
      "Use of protease inhibitor (trasylol) and heparin in cardiorespiratory resuscitation. II. Gasometric investigations of arterial blood. The purpose of the present work was to assess the effect of trasylol--an inhibitor of proteases--and heparin on gasometric values in arterial blood during cardio-respiratory resuscitation. The investigations were carried out on rabbits in three experimental groups. In group I the simplest resuscitation procedures were applied: artificial respiration with AMBU self-expanding bag and heart massage. In group II oxygen was given for respiration, heart massage was applied, cardiac, vasoactive and alkalinizing drugs were given. Group III received the above drugs and procedures but trasylol and herparin were used additionally. Cardiac arrest was obtained by means of acute hypoxia following suxamethonium administration. The investigations showed that in groups I and II despite resuscitation management arterial hypoxaemia and metabolic acidosis persisted while in group III a certain return of normal gasometric values was observed and the animals in this group survived the experiment.\n",
      "Porcine malignant hyperthermia induced by halothane and succinylcholine: failure of treatment with procaine or procainamide. Metabolic, hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to the combined use of halothane and succinylcholine (SCh) were measured in five normal swine and five swine susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH). Constant-volume ventilation was used, and no therapy was instituted. The overall response in susceptible swine was fulminant, in that it involved the rapid onset of SCh-induced MH combined with the more severe metabolic, endocrine, and cardiovascular effects of halothane-induced MH. Maximal changes in VO2 were equivalent with either drug or both combined, while changes in lactate, potassium (K+), pH, and catecholamines were perhaps synergistic. Utilizing similar measurements, procaine or procainamide was used in 20 susceptible swine in attempts to prevent MH initiated by halothane, SCh, or both. Recommended therapeutic doses of either drug did not prevent characteristic MH changes in oxygen consumption, cardiac output, lactate, K+, pH, catecholamines, or temperature.\n",

      "[Carbohydrate containing media for the detection of urease in \"Klebsiella\"]. Sone strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca grown on nutrient agar may appear \"urease negative\" in a Ferguson type reagent medium after a 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C. Amongst such 147 so called urease negative strains, urease has been detected within a few hours in 79 strains, when bacteria have grown on media containing carbohydrates (Kligler iron agar, Drigalski lactose agar, SS agar and Worfel-Ferguson sucrose medium). Acid production by carbohydrate fermentation increases urease production by Klebsiella: pH 4 is the most convenient pH for urease synthesis by these bacteria. The other 68 strains have been considered as urease-less Klebsiella. The best results are obtained from culture on Worfel-Ferguson sucrose medium: urea hydrolysis is positive--on an average-after 1 hour and 30 minutes when detected in a Ferguson type reagent medium, and after 2 hours and 35 minutes when detected in a Christensen reagent medium.\n",
      "[Ferrous ion oxidation and uranium solubilization from a lowgrade ore by \"Thiobacillus ferrooxidans\" (author's transl)]. The microbiological oxidation of ferrous ion and the extraction of uranium from a low-grade ore has been studied using an adapted strain of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The effect of temperature, pH, volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, K1a, and aeration number, Ia, on the activity of the microorganism has been determined. The activation energy for ferrous iron oxidation was calculated to be - 13.9 +/- 0.1 kcal/mole and inactivation (thermal death of bacteria) 53.3 +/- 0.2 kcal/mole. Temperature coefficient, Q10, was estimated to be 1.8. Uranium extraction varied between 80 and 100%.\n",
      "Ethanol and galactose metabolism as influenced by 4-methylpyrazole in alcoholics with and without nutritional deficiencies. Preliminary report of a new approach to pathogenesis and treatment in alcoholic liver disease. 4-Methyl pyrazole (4-MP, a specific inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase) reduced ethanol elimination by 30-50% and completely removed the ethanol-induced inhibition of galactose elimination in 2 control subjects. Ethanol elimination was accelerated in 2 alcoholics with adequate nutrition, but the effect of 4-MP was comparable to that in controls. In 2 other alcoholic subjects, who reported poor nutritional intake, intermediate rates of ethanol elimination were observed and 4-MP had almost no effect on ethanol or galactose elimination. These results suggest that alcohol abuse may result in an increased contribution to ethanol elimination by pathways other than that involving alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and that the decreased contribution from ADH, possibly potentiated by inadequate nutrition, may diminish the ethanol-induced shift in the NAD-coupled redox state. Since liver damage produced by alcohol abuse is believed to be related to changes from the normal redox state caused by ethanol, these results may explain why alcoholic liver damage is uncommon in alcoholics living on a  marginal diet. Since 4-MP effectively eliminates the ethanol-induced shift in the redox state, a therapeutic trial with 4-MP in alcoholics with a high risk for liver disease is indicated.\n",
      "A method for the regulation of microbial population density during continuous culture at high growth rates. A method for the continuous culture of microorganisms is described which employs growth-dependent pH changes to control the rate of addition of fresh medium to a culture vessel. The apparatus (the \"phauxostat\") supports, at constant pH, long-term continuous culture at rates near or at the maximum of which the organisms are capable. The buffering capacity of the inflowing medium determines the steady-state population density of the culture, but the rate of growth is independent of the buffering capacity. The fundamental theory of operation is tested and some basic parameters of growth are estimated using Escherichia coli B growing continuously in media containing glucose, glycerol or DL-lactate.\n",
      "Pyruvate fermentation in Rhodospirillum rubrum and after transfer from aerobic to anaerobic conditions in the dark. The fermentative metabolism of Rhodospirillum rubrum (strain Ha, F1, S1) was studied after transfering the cells from aerobic to anaerobic dark culture conditions. Pyruvate was metabolized mainly to acetate and formate, and to a lesser extent to CO2 and priopionate, by all strains. Therefore, pyruvate formate lyase would appear to be the characteristic key enzyme of the dark anaerobic fermentation metabolism in R. rubrum. Strain F1 and S1 metabolized the formate further to H2 and CO2. It is concluded that this cleavage was catalysed by a formate hydrogen lyase system. Strain Ha was unable to metabolize formate. The cleavage of formate and the synthesis of poly-beta-hydroxy-butyric acid were increased by a low pH value (approximately 6.5). Fermentation equations and schemes of the pyruvate metabolism are discussed.\n",
      "The influence of foster-home care on psychiatric patients. Adult patients placed into foster families by six administrations in three provinces of Canada were oberved at time of placement and followed up 18 months later. Over this period, they exhibited a substantial decline in symptoms-almost as great as with similar patients retained in the hospital. However, there was virtually no improvement in social functioning, despite the fact that the use of foster homes has been advocated mainly for the resocialization that was expected to occur there. In discussing the reasons for this paradoxical finding, recommendations are offered regarding the use of foster homes by mental health administrations.\n",
      "Sialic acid in thyroglobulin. II. Influence of sialic acid on ionization of tyrosine residues. During electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel at pH 9-5, it was noticed that sialic acid-poor thyroglobulin contains fewer low molecular weight fragments than sialic acid-rich thyroglobulin. Splitting off of sialic acid diminishes thenumber of phenolic groups of tyrosine, MIT, DIT and T4, which dissociate below pH 12-5. This phenomenon was interpreted as a result of lowered hydrophilia of these regions of the thyroglobulin molecule which contains tyrosine and its iodinated derivatives.\n",

      "Kawasaki disease. Relationship with infantile periarteritis nodosa. Until 1972, Kawasaki disease, or acute febrile infantile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS), was considered in Japan to be a nonfatal disease with a favorable prognosis. Based on the findings from two autopsy cases of MCLS, we believe that sudden and unexpected death during convalescence may be due to arterial lesions, especially those involving the coronary artery, that resemble those of periarteritis nodosa. Of 29 autopsy cases of MCLS, gathered from all over Japan, all exhibited arteritis lesions (eg, aneurysm due to coronary arteritis). Such vascular pathological findings may in fact represent the same entity as infantile periarteritis nodosa. Whether infantile periarteritis nodosa can be identified with the adult type is still debatable. The particular manifestations of infantile periarteritis nodosa might be related to severe vasculitis. Autopsy cases of infantile periarteritis nodosa without MCLS manifestations are being collected and studied.\n",
      "Portal hypertension and gastric lesions in the rat. Gastric lesions occurred spontaneously and were increased in number by seven hours of restraint stress in rats with portal vein constriction (PVC). Vagotomy and pyloroplasty protected the congested stomach from erosion formation with stress. Major weight loss occurred two days after PVC, but not thereafter. Platelet counts were decreased in intact and splenectomized rats with portal hypertension, but prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen were unaffected, and histological stains failed to demonstrate thrombin in the gastric blood vessels. The oxygen pressure (PO2) of the gastric luminal fluid was decreased at day 2, but was normal at day 4 after PVC. Hypersection of acid and abnormal acid equilibration were not observed in the stomach. Gastric congestion, weight loss, and possibly portasystemic shunting of blood contributed to the higher incidence of gastric erosions with portal hypertension.\n",
      "Scanning electron microscopy studies in muscular dystrophy. Scanning electron microscopy of unmanipulated erythrocytes from patients with myotonic dystrophy or Duchenne dystrophy and patients who were Duchenne carriers showed a large increase in the number of stomatocytes over the number in normal controls. No specific morhologic changes that would differentiate any of the dystrophic patients from one another were seen. Adverse conditions such as washing before fixation or extreme pH produced a greater change in erythrocytes from these patients than in those from normal controls.\n",
      "Comparison of the biological effects in rat of high doses of two 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline derivatives: chloroquine and glafenine. When given orally in elevated but nonlethal doses (150 to 450 mg/kg, on 2 consecutive days), glafenine induces in rats (body weight 100 g) a transient nephritis with an increase in blood urea, hypertrophy of adrenals, and some changes in the serum proteinogram. These effects do not appear to be due to the 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline structure from which glafenine is derived, as they are not observed with the structural analogue chloroquine given at equimolar doses under the same conditions. Further, they do not appear to be due to glycerol, the by-product of metabolic glafenine hydrolysis. The responsible molecule appears to be either glafenine itself or its acid metabolite 4-(0-carboxyphenylamino) 7-chloroquinoline.\n",
      "A comparative study on the irreversible binding of labeled halothane trichlorofluoromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride to hepatic protein and lipids in vitro and in vivo. 1) After intraperitoneal injection of labeled CCl4, CHCl3, and halothane in mice, 14C is preferentially bound to liver endoplasmic protein and lipid. A considerable activity is also associated with mitochondrial constituents. Maximal protein binding (nmol/mg): CCl4: 2.8 (0.5 hrs); CHCl3: 11.5 (6 hrs); halothane: 5 (6 hrs). Lipid binding: CCl4: 6.4 (5 min); CHCl3: 8 (4 hrs); halothane: 13.5 (2 hrs). The form of the binding curves in microsomal and mitochondrial protein and lipid differed with the individual haloalkanes. 2) The irreversible (covalent) binding of 14C from labeled haloalkanes in anaerobic suspensions of isolated rabbit liver microsomes and NADPH after 30 min was for protein (lipid) (nmol/mg): CCl4: 15 (58); CHCl3: 3.4 (3.2); halothane: 2.3 (10); trichlorofluoromethane: 6.5 (30). Anerobic incubation favored dehalogenation, but CHCl3 metabolism and irreversible binding requires oxygen. The greatest differences in the in vitro \"covalent\" binding rates were observed with CHCl3 in rat, mouse, and rabbit. 3) Altered microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentrations in newborn animals, or produced by pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), or CoCl2 effected similar, but not proportional changes in the rates of irreversible protein and lipid binding. Upon addition of CCl4 the difference of light absorption of reduced liver microsomes from MC-pretreated rats containing cytochrome P-448 appeared at 452 nm. The irreversible binding rate in these microsomes was also increased. The small accleration in irreversible binding in liver microsomes from rats pretreated with isopropanol is not proportional to the high increase of CCl4 toxicity. 4) Practically no binding to added, soluble albumin or RNA was observed in microsomal incubates. However, 14C is bound to the nicotine-adenine dinucleotides of the NADPH system. All haloalkanes produced a similar increase of NADPH oxidation in incubates of rabbit liver microsomes and NADPH.\n",
      "Interaction of thermostable direct hemolysin of Vibrio parahaemolyticus with human erythrocytes. The interaction between thermostable direct hemolysin produced by Vibrio parahaemolyticus WP-1 and human erythrocytes was studied. The lysis of human erythrocytes by the hemolysin was dependent of temperature and no hemolysis occurred at low temperature (0-4 C), but the hemolysin was adsorbed on human erythrocytes even at low temperature. No hemolysis was observed when antihemolysin antiserum was mixed with the hemolysin and human erythrocytes at zero time. On the other hand, lysis of the cells by hemolysin was not completely inhibited when the antiserum was added during the lag time and the inhibitory effect decreased with delay in the time of addition of antiserum. The inhibitory effect of the antiserum decreased with increase in the incubation temperature, increase in the concentration of divalent cations, and decrease in pH. These results suggest that lysis of human erythrocytes by the hemolysin is at least a two-step process consisting of adsorption of the hemolysin to human erythrocytes and the step(s) following adsorption.\n",
      "Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases of Euglena gracilis. Purification and properties of two distinct deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases of high molecular weight. Two DNA polymerases of high molecular weight, pol A (mol.wt. 190 000) and pol B (mol.wt. 240 ooo), have been purified 6300-fold and 1600-fold respectively from an extramitochondrial supernatant of a bleached strain of Euglena gracilis. They have very similar requirements when assayed with an 'activated'-DNA primer-template [the optimum conditions of pH and ionic (K+ and Mn2+) composition being 7.2, 25 mM and 0.2 mM respectively]. 0.2 mM-Mn2+ was about 1.5-2-fold as effective as 2 mM-Mg2+, owing to substrate activation by deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates in the presence of Mn2+. Km values for the triphosphates in the absence of activation were about 10(-6)M with Mn2+ and 8 X 10(-6) M with Mg2+ for both enzymes. They were inhibited to the same extent by N-ethylmaleimide, novobiocin and o-phenanthroline, but differed in their chromatographic behaviour on DEAE-cellulose and in their electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gel. No evidence was found for the existence in these cells of a DNA polymerase of low molecular weight, but there were indications that a third enzyme of high molecular weight might exist.\n",
      "Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases of Euglena gracilis. Primer-template utilization of and enzyme activities associated with the two deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases of high molecular weight. The two high-molecular-weight DNA polymerases from Euglena gracilis, pol A (mol. wt. 190 000) and pol B (mol. wt. 240 000), were differentiated on the basis of associated enzymic activities and primer-template utilization. Neither enzyme had endodeoxyribonuclease activity, but pol B, like pol B of yeast and the corresponding enzyme from Tetrahymena pyriformis, exhibited at least one other nuclease activity directed against denatured DNA and the RNA of an RNA-DNA hybrid. These nuclease functions preferred an alkaline pH and Mg2+. Pol B also exhibited nucleoside diphosphokinase activity. Both enzymes were active with 'activated' DNA and poly[d(A-T)] as primer-templates and were sensitive, especially pol B, to inhibition by excess of native or heat-denatured DNA. Pol B also utilized oligo[d(T)] and poly(A) templates under certain conditions, whereas pol A exhibited only slight activity with poly[d(A)]. (U)6 was not used as a primer by either enzyme.\n",

The molecular weight of the subunit is 52 000. The enzyme was purified 150-fold with a final specific activity of 20 mumol of NADP+ reduced/min per mg of protein and overall yield of 3%. The molecular weight of the native enzyme is estimated to be 104 000 from gel-filtration studies. The final purification step was carried out by affinity chromatography with NADP+-Sepharose. 2. The Km values for 6-phosphogluconate and NADP+ are approx. 54 muM and 23 muM respectively. 3. Citrate and pyrophosphate are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme with respect to both 6-phosphogluconate and NADP+. 4. MgCl2 affects the apparent Km for NADP+ at saturating concentrations of 6-phosphogluconate.\n",
      "Protein chromatography on adsorbents with hydrophobic and ionic groups. Some properties of N-(3-carboxypropionyl)aminodecyl-sepharose and its interaction with wheat-germ aspartate transcarbamoylase. 1. The charge state of two derivatives of Sepharose prepared by the CNBr activation method were studied by acid-base titration and by ion-exchange chromatography. Dodecyl-Sepharose exhibited cationic groups (21mumol/ml of settled gel; pKa=9.6) that were tentatively assigned to the coupling isourea group. 2. CPAD-Sepharose [N-(3-carboxypropionyl)aminodecyl-Sepharose] has anionic (carboxyl) groups (pKa=4.5) and cationic groups (pKa=9.6) in roughly equal concentrations (e coupling group. CPAD-Sepharose is slightly negatively charged at pH 7.0 and substantially negatively charged at pH 8.5. 3. The pKa values of dodecyl-Sepharose and CPAD-Sepharose are unaffected by a 100-fold increase in the concentration of KCl. 4. CPAD-Sepharose has considerable affinity for wheat-germ aspartate transcarbamoylase at pH 8.5 when the adsorbent and enzyme are both negatively charged. The interaction involves the C10 chain but is relatively moderate compared with C10 chains associated only with positive charge. 5. Desorption of the enzyme adsorbed to CPAD-Sepharose can be achieved by raising the pH to increase the electrostatic repulsion, or by introducing the detergent sodium deoxycholate. Acetone and butan-1-ol also weaken the adsorption at pH 8.5. 6. High concentrations of sodium acetate or sodium phosphate induced the enzyme to bind more tightly to CPAD-Sepharose. 7. These results are discussed in terms of a 'repulsion-controlled' model or hydrophobic chromatography.\n",
      "The effect of acid proteinase inhibitors on chicken pepsin. 1. The activity of chicken pepsin was partially inhibited by dimethyl-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl)sulphonium bromide, but was unaffected by p-bromophenacyl bromide. 2. In the presence of Cu2+, diazoacetylnorleucine methyl ester completely inactivated chicken pepsin with the incorporation of 1 mol/mol. The mechanism of the reaction was similar to that with pig pepsin. 3. Chicken pepsin was completely inactivated by 2-diazo-4-bromoacetophenone in the presence of Cu2+. 4. Chicken pepsin was almost completely inactivated by 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane at 25 degrees C, 3-4mol of inhibitor/mol being incorporated. The reaction at 10 degrees C was investigated briefly. 5. Calf chymosin was inactivated by 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane at 10 degrees C, the incorporation of 1 mol/mol being required for complete inhibition. 6. The characteristics of the reactions of chicken pepsin with the above compounds were compared with those of other acid proteinases.\n",
      "The purification and properties of pig spleen phosphofructokinase. Pig spleen phosphofructokinase has been purified 800-fold with a yield of 17%. Two isoenzymes that appear to be kinetically identical can be separated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. In common with the enzyme from other mammalian sources, the spleen enzyme has a pH optimum of 8.2. At pH 7.0 it displays sigmoidal kinetics with respect to fructose 6-phosphate concentration but its co-operative behaviour is very dependent on pH, protein concentration and the concentration of MgATP. MgGTP and MgITP can replace MgATP as phosphate donors but, unlike MgATP, these nucleotides do not cause significant inhibition. Mn2+ and Co2+ (as the metal ion-ATP complexes) act as cofactors and in the free form are far more inhibitory than free Mg2+. The spleen enzyme responds to a wide variety of potential effector molecules: ADP, AMP, cyclic AMP, aspartate, NH4+, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate and Pi all act as either activators or protectors, whereas Mg-ATP, Mg2+, citrate, phosphoenol-pyruvate and the phosphoglucerates are inhibitors.\n",
      "The effect of disulfiram on the aldehyde dehydrogenases of sheep liver. 1. The effect of disulfiram on the activity of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenases of sheep liver was studied. 2. Disulfiram causes an immediate inhibition of the enzyme reaction. The effect on the cytoplasmic enzyme is much greater than on the mitochondrial enzyme. 3. In both cases, the initial partial inhibition is followed by a gradual irreversible loss of activity. 4. The pH-rate profile of the inactivation of the mitochondrial enzyme by disulfiram and the pH-dependence of the maximum velocity of the enzyme-catalysed reaction are both consistent with the involvement of a thiol group. 5. Excess of 2-mercaptoethanol or GSH abolishes the effect of disulfiram. However, equimolar amounts of either of these reagents and disulfiram cause an effect greater than does disulfiram alone. It was shown that the mixed disulphide, Et2N-CS-SS-CH2-CH2OH, strongly inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase. 6. The inhibitory effect of diethyldithiocarbamate in vitro is due mainly to contamination by disulfiram.\n",
      "A reporter group delivery system with both absolute and selective specificity for thiol groups and an improved fluorescent probe containing the 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole moiety. 1. 4-(N-2-Aminoethyl2'-pyridyl disulphide)-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (compound I) was synthesized and evaluated as a fluorescent labelling reagent for thiol groups. 2. The design of compound (I) as one example of a general type of reporter group delivery reagent (2-pyridyl-S-S-X, where X contains an environmentally sensitive spectroscopic probe) is discussed. 3. The electronic absorption spectrum of compound (I) was determined over a wide range of pH and the spectral changes that accompany its reaction with low-molecular-weight thiols, e.g. L-cysteine, and with papain (EC 3.4.22.2) and bovine serum albumin are discussed. 4. A new value of epsilon343 for 2-thiopyridone (Py-2-SH) was determined as 8.08 X 10(3) +/- 0.08 X 10(3)M-1-cm-1. 5. Spectral analysis of the reactions of compound (I) with L-cysteine and with papain (in the pH range 3.5-8.0) showed that even under equimolar conditions the reaction (thiol-disulphide interchange to release Py-2-SH) is essentially stoicheimoetric and probably proceeds by specific attack at the sulphur atom distal from the pyridyl ring of compound (I). 6. The fluorescence-emission spectra of compound (I) and of the products of its reaction with papain and with ficin (EC 3.4.22.3) were determined. Compound (I) is highly fluorescent in aqueous solution. Excitation within the intense visible absorption band (lambda max. 481 nm, epsilon max. 2.52 X 10(4)M-1-cm-1) provides green fluorescence with an emission maximum at 540 nm. Both papain and ficin labelled by reaction with compound (I) are characterized by fluorescence-emission maxima (535 nm and 530 nm respectively) of even higher intensity. The fluorescence emission of the product of the reaction of papain with compound (I) was shown to be 25 times more intense than that of the product of the reaction of papain with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (Nbd chloride). 7. The second-order rate constants (k2) for the reactions of compound (I) and of Nbd chloride with GSH, papain, albumin, ficin, 2-benzimidazolylmethanethiol and 2-benzimidazolylethanethiol were determined at 25.0 degrees C and various pH values. At pH4 the values of k2(compound I)/k2(Nbd chloride) are: GSH, 288; albumin, 36; papain 3 X 10(3); ficin, 3 X 10(4). 8. The pH-k2 profiles for the reactions of compound (I) and of Nbd chloride with the two 2-benzimidazolylalkanethiols were determined. Of the four profiles only that for the reaction of compound (I) with 2-benzimidazolylmethanethiol is characterized by a striking rate maximum in acidic media.\n",
      "Differential effects of temperature on a membrane adenosine triphosphatase and associated phosphatase. Arrhenius plots of a membrane (Na+ + K+)-dependent ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) activity showed characteristic discontinuities, whereas those of the associated K+-dependent phosphatase activity did not. These findings support the contention that the phosphatase activity does not depend on phospholipid in the same way as does the ATPase activity.\n",
      "The action of chelating agents on human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase. Human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase was inhibited by aromatic chelating agents. However, structurally related compounds with much lower metal-complexing ability displayed affinities for enzyme essentially equal to those of their respective chelating analogues. Inhibition was competitive with respect to the coenzyme. It is suggested that hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitors and the coenzyme-binding site of the enzyme are responsible for the observed effects on activity.\n",
      "An improved assay for bacterial methane mono-oxygenase: some properties of the enzyme from Methylomonas methanica. Extracts of Methylomonas methanica catalyse the O2-and NAD(P)H-dependent disappearance of bromomethane. The activity is unstable at 2 degrees C but is stable at --70 degrees C for several weeks. Bromomethane mono-oxygenase is particulate and is inhibited by metal-binding reagents, by compounds SKF 525A and Lilly 53325, by some metal ions and by acetylene. Evidence is presented that indicates that bromomethane mono-oxygenase is the enzyme responsible for methane oxidation in vivo.\n",
      "Iron oxidation and transferrin formation by phosvitin. The catalytic activity of phosvitin in Fe(II) oxidation and the addition of iron to transferrin were studied under various conditions. It was concluded that the Fe(II) oxidized by phosvitin would bind to apotransferrin, although an appreciable fraction of Fe(III) remained bound to phosvitin. Fe(III) also migrated from phosvitin to apotransferrin. This reaction was first-order with respect to Fe(III)-phosvitin concentration with a half-time (t1/2) of 10 min, and a first-order rate constant, k=0.069min-1, in 700 muM-phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 30 degrees C. The catalysis of the oxidation of Fe(III) by phosvitin was proportional to O2 concentration, and is quite different from the relative O2 independence of Fe(II) oxidation as catalysed by ferroxidase. A scheme for the mobilization and transfer of iron in the chicken, including the role of ferroxidase, phosyitin and transferrin, is presented.\n",
      "The substrate specificity of thermomycolase, an extracellular serine proteinase from the thermophilic fungus Malbranchea pulchella var. sulfurea. The specificity of thermomycolase toward glucagon and the oxidized A and B chains of insulin was investigated. Extensive digestion of glucagon occurred when conducted at pH 7.0 and 45 degrees C for 40 min, whereas hydrolysis of only three peptide bonds occurred at pH 7.0 and 28 degrees C for 5 min. A similar situation was observed for the oxidized B chain of insulin, which exhibited only a single major cleavage after 5 min at 25 degrees C. No well-defined specificity for particular amino acid residues was evident, but ready hydrolysis of peptide bonds occurred within sequences containing non-polar residues. This endoproteinase must therefore possess an extended hydrophobic binding site for polypeptides. Thermomycolase hydrolysed acetylalanylalanylalanine methyl ester and elastin-Congo Red at 22 and 8.5 times the rate of porcine elastase respectively. A limited degradation of native collagen and significant hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro were suggestive of some collagenase-like activity. No keratinase activity was apparent.\n",
      "Stimulation of rat liver beta-galactosidase activity by ions. 1.  The p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactosidase asctivity in rat liver homogenates of lysosome-rich fractions was shown to be markedly affected by the ionic composition of the medium.  A stimulation of the reaction rate at pH 5 was produced by most of the salts tested, which contained anions such as acetate, SO4(2-) and Cl-, and cations such as Na+, K= and Mg2+.  The most pronounced effect was observed with MgCl2.  Only potassium glutamate was inhibitory. 2. Five peaks of beta-galactosidase activity obtained by DEAE-cellulose chromatography were equally sensitive to changes in the ionic composition of the medium.  In the presence of added NaC1, the whole rate-pH curve was displaced towards higher pH values, the optimum being shifted from 2.0-2.5 to 3.5.  The stimulation at pH 5.0 appeared to be mainly due to changes in Vmax., whereas the apparent Km was slightly modified. 3. Unlike the total, the free beta-galactosidase activity remained unchanged or even declined when KC1 was added to the reaction medium.\n",
      "Pig heart lactate dehydrogenase. Binding of pyruvate and the interconversion of pyruvate-containing ternary complexes. 1. Lactate oxidation catalysed by pig heart lactate dehydrogenase was studied in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of pyruvate. Experimental results show the presence of an intermediate which occurs immediately after the hydride transfer step, but before the dissociation of pyruvate and the H+ produced by the reaction. The rate constant for pyruvate dissociation and the dissociation constant for pyruvate from the ternary complex differ from those obtained in pyruvate reduction experiments. 2. In single-turnover pyruvate reduction by pig heart lactate dehydrogenase at pH8.0 pyruvate can bind to the enzyme before a H+ is taken up, and the subsequent uptake of a H+ is governed by a step that is also rate-limiting for single-turnover and steady-state NADH oxidation. 3. Observation of various intermediates in the single-turnover pyruvate reduction experiments has made it possible to determine separately the dissociation constant and Km value for pyruvate at pH8.0, and also the catalytic turnover rate and Km for pyruvate under first-order conditions at different pH values. 4. Further studies on single-turnover pyruvate reduction carried out in 2H2O, or in water at low temperature, show another step which, under these conditions, is slower than that controlling H+ uptake and rate-limiting for NADH oxidation. A scheme is presented which explains these results.\n",

      "[Intracellular pH of cardiac muscle after administration of potassium-magnesium-aspartate (author's transl)]. 27 Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital. Artificial ventilation was given by a Starling pump respirator via a tracheal tube. Intracellular pH of cardiac muscle was determined by means of the indirect procedure of measuring the distribution of 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) in intra- and extracellular spaces (DMO-method). 12 rats were injected i.p. with 0.33 mval potassium-magnesium-aspartate/100 g body weight and 15 rats served as controls. Using a regression analysis, the following relationships were obtained: 1. animals injected with potassium-magnesium-aspartate pHa = --0.75 log PaCO2 + 8.535, PHi = --0.30 log PaCO2 + 7.509, pHi = 0.41 pHa + 4.036; 2. control animals pHa = --0.59 log PaCO2 + 8.308, pHi = --0.27 log PaCO2 + 7.381, pHi = 0.47 pHa + 3.503. At a pCO2 of 40 torr a pHa of 7.33 (7.36) and a pHi of 7.03 (6.95) was obtained. At an arterial pH of 7.40 the pHi was 7.07 (6.98). The results of the control group are written in brackets. -- The experiments demonstrate an increase in the intracellular buffer bases after administration of potassium-magnesium-aspartate. This effect can be recognized by a concomitant increase in the intracellular pH of 0.09 compared to the control group.\n",
      "Pharmacological properties of 2-(2-chloro-p-toluidino)-2-imidazoline-nitrate (tolonidine), a new antihypertensive agent. III. Action on the secretions of the digestive tract and on the central nervous system, acute toxicity. The pharmacological properties of 2-(2-chloro-p-toluidino)-2-imidazoline-nitrate (tolonidine) a new synthetic derivative of imidazoline are reported in a series of three successive articles. This compound has been shown to possess hypotensive and antihypertensive properties. After i.v. administration, the hypotensive phase was preceded by hypertension related to the potent direct alpha-sympatheticomimetic properties of the product. This pressor response, which was not seen after oral administration, was accompanied by a marked decrease in cardiac output and a significant increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The hypotensive action of the product was due to a drop in cardiac output probably reinforced by a decrease in vasoconstrictor sympathetic tone due to a central action. Whatever the route of administration, tolonidine slowed heart rate independently of blood pressure variations, due essentially to an increase in vagal tone. In studies of diuresis, liquid and salt loss were observed in the cat, not in the dog. At doses which induce a drop in blood pressure tolonidine did not produce a reduction in pilocarpine-induced salivary secretion and only partially inhibited gastric secretion. In the central nervous system, tolonidine produced a sedation which first appeared at doses having an antihypertensive effect but which was only fully apparent with increased doses. A decrease in the release of cerebral amines, serotonin and noradrenaline by tolonidine is proposed. Tolonidine was compared with three other antihypertensive agents: clonidine, which is structurally related, and guanethidine and mecamylamine, which are structurally unrelated and have a different mode of action. A close resemblance of the pharmacological properties of tolonidine and clonidine was established due to the chemical relationship between the two substances.\n",
      "[On the influence of a special preparation of oxytetracycline and sodiumbituminosulfonates on amount and composition of skin surface lipids in acne vulgaris (author's transl)]. Two groups of 27 and 23 patients with acne vulgaris were first treated for a period of one week with 1 g oxytetracycline a day p.o. In a second treatment period of 6 weeks the first group received 100 mg oxytetracycline a day p.o. and the second group a combination of 100 mg oxytetracycline and 1.2 g sodiumbituminosulfonates a day p.o. In the third treatment period, similarly continued for 6 weeks, the method was reversed. Gastric juice-insoluble preparations were used for the investigation. All criteria for a double-blind study were considered. Amount and composition of the skin surface lipids were analysed before beginning the treatment, at the end of the 2nd and at the end of the 3rd treatment period. The combination of both agents in gastric juice-insoluble preparations suppresses to a great extent the known effects brought about by the substances separately, namely the reduction in free fatty acids and the decrease in the skin surface lipids. The findings also show that the reduction of the free fatty acids was in a limited time observed only in patients treated with 100 mg oxytetracycline a day p.o. if they had been treated in the beginning of this therapy with a higher dosage of tetracycline.\n",
      "[Influence of ethanol on the in vitro and in vivo drug release from some sustained release tablets (author's transl)]. The in vitro and in vivo liberation of acetylsalicylic acid from sustained release tablets in presence of ethanol is described. Simultaneous uptake of 120 ml commercial brandy resulted in a faster release of the active substance from the tablets prepared with Eudragit ret-l (PM), as has been proved by urinary excretion data. These results were supported by experiments with a pH-endoaradio transmitter and by radiography.\n",
      "Changes in liver function after different types of surgery. Liver function tests carried out after minor surgical procedures, under anaesthesia lasting for 1 hr, showed no abnormalities. Tests after body surface operations under the same anaesthetic techniques showed transient derangements. After intra-abdominal procedures, liver dysfunction was more marked, although no patients with evidence of preoperative liver dysfunction or postoperative surgical complications were studied and none received blood transfusions. Measurements of the serum bilirubin concentration showed the most frequent abnormalities, but the pseudocholinesterase concentration decreased progressively after intra-abdominal surgery and b.s.p. retention increased significantly. Serum concentration of intracellular enzymes (LDH, s.g.o.t. and s.g.p.t.) increased within an hour of starting surgery, changes which were probably not related to liver function.\n",
      "Studies on the energy metabolism in lichen planus. Various epidermal enzymes and cofactors were measured in patients with lichen planus and in healthy controls with the aid of Lowry's microtechniques, including enzymatic cycling. The steady-state levels of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides NAD and NADP were decreased and this was evident even in areas still free from lesions. The oxidized and reduced portions of NAD were altered indicating changed equilibria of NAD dependent dehydrogenases. Reduced NADP was more tightly controlled at the normal level which is regarded as evidence of an unaltered biosynthetic potential in this disease. In conjunction with earlier data the results indicate a preserved glycolytic and pentose shunt activity while the mitochondria display signs of dysfunction.\n",
      "The lichen planus-like eruption after bone marrow transplantation. A lichen planus-like eruption was seen in four patients after bone marrow transplantation. The skin and mucous membrane appearance closely mimicked lichen planus. The histopathology was also very similar to lichen planus. The occurrence of a lichen planus-like eruption (LPLE) after an immune basal cell damage related to the graft-versus-host reaction raised the question of the immune nature of this eruption. The correlation found between biological signs of graft-versus-host reaction and the out-break or relapse of the lichen planus-like eruption supports the hypothesis that the skin changes could be a sign of a chronic immune response against recipient epidermis.\n",
      "The effect of pH upon human transferrin: selective labelling of the two iron-binding sites. The influence of pH changes upon the iron-binding properties of transferrin was investigated in the absence of chelating agents. The effects were demonstrated by spectrophotometry, gel filtration, and by studies of the intermolecular transfer of 59Fe from transferrin to conalbumin. At pH values below 6.7, diferric transferrin readily loses iron. The monoferric molecule, which is relatively resistant to acid dissociation, is preferentially formed. A temporary reduction of pH provides a simple method for selectively attaching iron to one metal-binding site, and allows double isotopic labelling of the transferrin molecule. This technique may permit further investigation of the physiological properties of the two iron-binding sites.\n",
      "The effect of parturition on amniotic fluid lecithin concentration. Amniotic fluid lecithin has been measured during the antenatal period and at comparable periods of gestation at the onset of spontaneous labour. Lecithin values were higher in labour, the difference being statistically significant in two of the three groups studied. Lecithin values were also measured serially during induced labour in 14 normal women at term. A significant fall was observed throughout labour. Creatinine levels were measured in the amniotic fluid in five of these patients and showed no significant change.\n",
      "The effects of narcotics on fetal acid base status. This paper reports two randomized control trials on the effects of nalorphine, pethidine, morphine and heroin on fetal and maternal acid base status. The drugs decreased pH and increased pCO2 in the mother, and decreased pH and base excess in the fetus. The changes in the fetus were independent of the changes in the mother. In equivalent dosages, nalorphine increased maternal pCO2 more than pethidine and morphine. The effects of heroin were found to be greater than that of other drugs, and we suggest that heroin should be avoided where the fetus is already at risk.\n",
      "On the solution conformation of bradykinin and certain fragments. A circular dichroism (CD) study of [D-Pro2]- and [D-Pro3]-bradykinin, selected peptide fragments, and the model compound. N-acetyl-L-phenylalaninamide, support our previous conclusion (Biochemistry 12, 3780, 1973) that the positive 221-nm CD band of bradykinin is a composite of bands due to two chromophores, the 217-nm band characteristic of the Phe residues overlying the 223-nm band of the N-terminal sequence, Arg-Pro-Pro. The results also indicate that the 223-nm band of Arg-Pro-Pro is associated with the configuration of the Pro-Pro sequence, Arg-D-Pro-Pro and Arg-Pro-D-Pro virtually being diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the conformation of Arg-Pro-Pro was probed in further detail. Upon increasing the temperature from about 27 to 65 degrees C, Arg-Pro-Pro undergoes a conformational transition characterized by large positive values of deltaHdegrees and deltaSdegrees, which is interpreted to mean that the structure of water and, thus, solute-solvent interactions play a dominant role in determining the conformation of the peptide 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates that the effect of lowering the pH on the CD of Arg-Pro-Pro is explicable in terms of hydrogen-bond formation between the carboxyl group and Pro2 carbonyl oxygen at acid pH with concomitant cis to trans isomerization.\n",
      "The activation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase by carbon dioxide and magnesium ions. Equilibria, kinetics, a suggested mechanism, and physiological implications. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase was activated by incubation with CO2 and Mg2++, and inactivated upon removal of CO2 and Mg2+ by gel filtration. The activation process involved CO2 rather than HCO3-. The activity of the enzyme was dependent upon the preincubation concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+ and upon the preincubation pH, indicating that activation involved the reversible formation of an equilibrium complex of enzyme-CO2-Mg. The initial rate of activation was linearly dependent upon the CO2 concentration but independent of the Mg2+ concentration. Kinetic analyses indicated that the enzyme reacted first with CO2 in a rate-determining and reversible step, followed by a rapid reaction with Mg2+ to form an active ternary complex (see eq 1 in text). The pseudo-first order rate constant, kobsd, for the activation process at constant pH was derived: kobsd=k1[CO2] + (k2k4/k3[Mg2+]). Experimentally, kobsd was shown to be linearly dependent upon the CO2 concentration and inversely dependent upon the Mg2+ concentration. The activity of the enzyme after preincubation to equilibrium at constant concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+ increased as the preincubation pH was raised, indicating that CO2 reacted with an enzyme group whose pK was distinctly alkaline. It is proposed that the activation of ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylane involves the formation of a carbamate.\n",
      "Manganese (II) and substrate interaction with unadenylylated glutamine synthetase (Escherichia coli w). II. Electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of enzyme-bound manganese(II) with substrates and a potential transition-state analogue, methionine sulfoximine. The enhancement of the longitudinal proton relaxation rate of solvent water protons which occurs when Mn(II) is bound to the \"tight\" metal ion site of unadenylylated glutamine synthetase (GS) was used to determine the binding constant of L-methionine (SR)-sulfoximine to GS-Mn(II) complexes. The binary enhancement for GS-Mn(II) is 22 at 24 MHz, 25 degrees C. The enhancement is lowered in the presence of the sulfoximine and the computed dissociation constant is 30 muM with epsilont, the enhancement for the ternary complex, equal to 3.0. Titration curves for the sulfoximine were also obtained in the presence of Mg-ADP, Mg-ADP plus Pi, and Mg-ATP. The dissociation constants were 9, 5, and 0.8 muM, respectively. The progressive tightening of the dissociation constants is symptomatic of conformational changes at the active site as the total subsite occupied by ATP is filled. The number of rapidly exchanging water molecules drops from 2 to approximately 0.1 when saturating concentrations of L-methionine (SR)-sulfoximine and nucleotide are present. The kinetically determined KI value of approximately 4 muM for the sulfoximine is about three orders of magnitude tighter than thee Km' value of approximately 3 mM for L-glutamate. The previously mentioned dissociation constants obtained by enhancement titrations are also orders of magnitude tighter than Km'. These data suggest that L-methionine (SR)-sulfoximine is a \"transition-state\" analogue for the glutamine synthetase reaction. ...\n",
      "The interaction of borate and sulfite with pyridine nucleotides. The kinetics and equilibria of the borate interaction at ribose with NAD+ and NMN+ have been measured using as a chromophoric probe the perturbation effect borate has on the addition of sulfite to the 4 position of the nicotinamide ring. NAD+ and NMN+ have more favorable borate association constants than do their corresponding sulfite addition complexes. The rate of interaction of the ribose moiety with borate at low borate buffer concentration is dependent on the concentration of both borate and boric acid. At high borate concentration the rate becomes independent of borate concentration, indicating the existence of a two-step process for the interaction of NAD-sulfite with borate with a change of rate-determining step from the interaction of the ribose hydroxyl group with borate at low borate to an elimination of sulfite at high borate concentration. A linear free energy relationship with a slope of 0.94 describes an increased reactivity of the nucleotide for sulfite as the affinity of the nucleotide for sulfite increases.\n",
      "Oxidation of corticosteroids to steroidal-21-oic acids by human liver enzyme. An enzyme that oxidizes corticosteroids to acidic metabolites has been purified from postmortem human liver. The most rapidly oxidized substrate was 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC). Other corticosteroids were oxidized at rates that were 10% or less of DOC. The products of DOC oxidation were 3, 20-dioxopregn-4-en-21-oic acid and 20-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-en-21-oic acid. The 20-keto acid was the predominant metabolite in all enzyme preparations. Keto acid and hydroxy acid were not interconverted. Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the transfer of tritium from [21-3H]DOC to water. The enzyme is yellow, and has spectral maxima at 278 and 405 nm. Inhibition by o-phenanthroline suggests that it may be a metalloenzyme. Molecular weight was estimated at 74 000 +/- 8 000; a pH maximum occurred at pH 8-8.5. This enzyme may participate in the in vivo conversion of corticosteroids to the acidic metabolites that we have described previously (H.L. Bradlow et al. (1973), J. Clin. Endocrinol.

      "A spectrophotometric and fluorimetric study of alkaline transitions of Euglena cytochrome c 552. The behavior of the photosynthetic cytochrome c552 upon titration with alkali depends on the ionic composition of the medium. In water the disappearance of the 695-nm band, indicating the displacement of the methionine ligand, as well as a remarkable tryptophan fluorescense enhancement, follow a single proton titration curve with pK of 10.0 and n=1.0. The product is a low spin type protein. In salt-containing media two successive steps are observed: in the first one, completed at about pH 10.3, a high-spin form of cytochrome c 552 is obtained and relatively small fluorescence enhancement is detected. In the second step, more profound fluorometric changes occur, while the material reverts to its low-spin form. Addition of salts to an alkaline solution of cytochrome c 552 in water results in the formation of a 600-nm high-spin band with a concomitant quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. The results imply that at high pH unfolding of the molecule is evident only when the low-spin product is obtained. In the high-spin alkaline form, the methionine ligand is probably displaced from iron coordination by hydroxyl ions, while in the low-spin alkaline form methionine may be replaced by a lysyl residue of the cytochrome c 552 protein. The results imply that the lysyl residue is available for coordination in salt solutions at a higher pH than in water.\n",
      "Synthetic flavinyl peptides related to the active site of mitochondrial monoamine oxidase II. Fluorescence properties. The fluorescence properties of various 8alpha-sulfur-linked flavinyl peptides and related flavin analogues were investigated as the pH solvent, temperature, and flavin concentration were varied. Substitution in the 8alpha position by a thioether-linked peptide brings about a marked quenching of fluorescence (up to 98% in water), a slight bathochromic shift and broadening of the fluorescence emission spectra, and a slight decrease in the fluorescence lifetimes. Oxidation of the thioether function to a sulfone partially releases this fluorescence quenching without further changes in the fluorescence emission spectra. The primary effect on the fluorescence intensity is due to an interaction between the nonbonding electrons of the thioether, the hydrogen-bonding, polar solvent, and the isoalloxazine ring. Dissolving these flavinyl peptides in nonaqueous solvents increases the fluorescence intensity as much as  20-fold. A secondary effect on flavinyl fluorescence can be attributed to a collisional quenching by the vicinal tyrosyl residue within tyrosine-containing flavinyl peptides. The fluorescence properties provide further confirmation of the identity of the synthetic and naturally obtained flavinyl peptides and of the interaction between the free-hydroxyl functions of the ribityl side chain and the thioether.\n",
      "High molecular weight deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from crown gall tumor cells of periwinkle (Vinca rosea). A high molecular weight (6 S) plant DNA polymerase from axenic Vinca rosea tissue culture cells has been purified 2200-fold and characterized. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 105 000 (+/-5000). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme yields polypeptide subunits having molecular weights of 70 000 and 34 000. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.5; a cation requirement optimum of 6 mM Mg2+ or 0.5 mM Mn2+; an apparent requirement for Zn2+; a Km of 1 muM for dTTP; and a 3.5-fold stimulation by 50 mM KCl. The enzyme is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM), heparin (0.1 muM), ethanol (5%), pyrophosphate (0.05 muM), and o-phenanthroline (0.1 mM) but is insensitive to rifamycin. Denatured DNA is found to be the best natural template, and only negligible activity can be demonstrated with the ribopolymer templates poly(dT)n-poly(rA)n and p(dT)10-poly(rA)n. In addition to the polymerization reaction, the enzyme catalyzes a pyrophosphate exchange reaction. Antibody to calf thymus 6-8S DNA polymerase does not inhibit DNA polymerase from Vinca rosea, suggesting no antigenic relationships between the mammalian and plant enzymes.\n",
      "Preparation, characterization, and chemical properties of the flavin coenzyme analogues 5-deazariboflavin, 5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphate, and 5-deazariboflavin 5'-diphosphate, 5'leads to5'-adenosine ester. In order to facilitate interpretation of the deazaisoalloxazine system as a valid mechanistic probe of flavoenzyme catalysis, we have examined some of the fundamental chemical properties of this system. The enzymatic synthesis, on a micromole scale, of the flavin coenzyme analogues 5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphate (deazaFMN) and 5-deazariboflavin 5'-diphosphate, 5' leads to 5'adenosine ester (deazaFAD) has been achieved. This latter synthesis is accomplished with a partially purified FAD synthetase complex (from Brevibacterium ammoniagenes), containing both phosphorylating and adenylylating activities, allowing direct conversion of the riboflavin analogue to the flavin adenine dinucleotide level. The structure of the reduced deazaflavin resulting from enzymatic and chemical reduction is established as the 1,5-dihydrodeazaflavin by proton magnetic resonance. Similarly, the C-5 position of the deazaflavins is demonstrated to be the locus for hydrogen transfer in deazaflavin redox reactions. Preparation of 1,5-dihydrodeazaflavins by sodium borohydride reduction stabilized them to autoxidation (t 1/2 approximately 40 h, 22 degrees C) although dihydrodeazaflavins are rapidly oxidized by other electron acceptors, including riboflavin, phenazine methosulfate, methylene blue, and dichlorophenolindophenol. Mixtures of oxidized and reduced deazaflavins undergo a rapid two-electron disproportionation (k = 22 M-1 S-1 0 degrees C), and oxidized deazaflavins form transient covalent adducts with nitroalkane anions at pH less than 5. Generalized methods for the synthesis of isotopically labeled flavin and deazaflavin coenzymes and their purification by adsorptive chromatography are given.\n",
      "Enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions with the flavin analogues 5-deazariboflavin, 5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphte, and 5-deazariboflavin 5'-diphosphate, 5' leads to 5'-adenosine ester. The ability of 5-deazaisoalloxazines to substitute for the isoalloxazine (flavin) coenzyme has been examined with several flavoenzymes. Without exception, the deazaflavin is recognized at the active site and undergoes a redox change in the presence of the specific enzyme substrate. Thus, deazariboflavin is reduced catalytically by NADH in the presence of the Beneckea harveyi NAD(P)H:(flavin) oxidoreductase, the reaction proceeding to an equilibrium with an equilibrium constant near unity. This implies an E0 of -0.310 V for the deazariboflavindihydrodeazariboflavin couple, much lower than that for isoalloxazines. With this enzyme, both riboflavin and deazariboflavin show the same stereospecificity with respect to the pyridine nucleotide, and despite a large difference in Vmax for the two, both have the same rate-determining step (hydrogen transfer). Direct transfer of the hydrogen is seen between the nicotinamide and deazariboflavin in both reaction directions. DeazaFMN reconstituted yeast NADPH: (acceptor) oxidoreductase (Old Yellow Enzyme), and deazaFAD reconstituted D-amino acid:O2 oxidoreductase and Aspergillus niger D-glucose O2 oxidoreductase are all reduced by substrate at approximately 10(-5) the rate of holoenzyme; none are reoxidized by oxygen or any of the tested artificial electron acceptors, though deazaFADH-bound to D-amino acid:O2 oxidoreductase is rapidly oxidized by the imino acid product. Direct hydrogen transfer from substrate to deazaflavin has been demonstrated for both deazaFAD-reconstituted oxidases. These data implicate deazaflavins as a unique probe of flavin catalysis, in that any mechanism for the flavin catalysis must account for the deazaflavin reactivity as well.\n",
      "Electrofocusing and kinetic studies of adult and embryonic chicken pyruvate kinases. Chicken embryos less than 15 days old contain only the K isozyme of pyruvate kinase, which appears to exist in vivo as an R,T conformational set with pI values of 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. Sets of lower pI and higher pI K-isozyme variants also are obtained. Whole embryos of 15 days or more of development show progressively increasing amounts of higher pI, lower K0.5S enzymatic variants. Tissue distribution and kinetic properties suggest that the highest pI form (pH 8.8-9.0) is an M-isozyme analogue. The intermediate forms are postulated to be hybrids. Adult liver extracts contain only the embryonic K isozyme; no evidence for an L-isozyme analogue was obtained. All major forms of the enzymes are compared with respect to saturation by phosphoenolpyruvate in the absence of effector and in the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, alanine, serine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and/or Mg-ATP.\n",
      "Characterization of a cytochrome P-450 dependent monoterpene hydroxylase from the higher plant Vinca rosea. A monooxygenase isolated from 5-day old etiolated Vinca rosea seedlings was shown to catalyze the hydroxylation of the monoterpene alcohols, geraniol and nerol, to their corresponding 10-hydroxy derivatives. Hydroxylase activity was inpendent upon NADPH (neither NADH nor combination of NADH, NADP+ and ATP served as substitutes) and O2. Geraniol hydroxylation was enhanced by dithiothreitol (monothiols were less effective) and inhibited by phospholipases, thiol reagents, metyrapone, and cytochrome c, as well as other inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 systems. Geraniol was hydroxylated at a faster rate than nerol, but the alcohols possessed similar apparent Km values. The membrane-bound hydroxylase was solubilized by treatment with sodium cholate, Renex-30, or Lubrol-WX. Cholate-treated enzyme was resolved by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and reconstitution of the hydroxylase was effected utilizing different fractions containing cytochrome P-450, a NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and lipid.\n",
      "Methionine sulfoxide cytochrome c. Cytochrome c has been chemically modified by methylene blue mediated photooxidation. It is established that the methionine residues of the protein have been specifically converted to methionine sulfoxide residues. No oxidation of any other amino acid residues or the cysteine thioether bridges of the molecule occurs during the photooxidation reaction. The absorbance spectrum of methionine sulfoxide ferricytochrome c at neutrality is similar to that of the unmodified protein except for an increase in the extinction coefficient of the Soret absorbance band and for the complete loss of the ligand sensitive 695 nm absorbance band in the spectrum of the derivative. The protein remains in the low spin configuration which implies the retention of two strong field ligands. Spin state sensitive spectral titrations and model studies of heme peptides indicate that the sixth ligand is definitely not provided by a lysine residue but may be methionine-80 sulfoxide coordinated via its sulfur atom. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that the heme crevice of methionine sulfoxide ferri- and ferrocytochrome c is weakened relative to native cytochrome c. The redox potential of methionine sulfoxide cytochrome c is 184 mV which is markedly diminished from the 260 mV redox potential of native cytochrome c. The modified protein is equivalent to native cytochrome c as a substrate for cytochrome oxidase and is not autoxidizable at neutral pH but is virtually inactive with succinate-cytochrome c reductase. These results indicate that the major role of the methionine-80 in cytochrome c is to preserve a closed hydrophobic heme crevice which is essential for the maintainance of the necessary redox potential.\n",
      "A kinetic study of protein-protein interactions. Kinetic studies have been carried out of the monomer-dimer interaction of insulin, beta-lactoglobulin, and alpha-chymotrypsin using stopped-flow and temperature-jump techniques. The pH indicators bromothymol blue, bromophenol blue, and phenol red were used to monitor pH changes associated with the monomer-dimer interaction. In all three cases a kinetic process was observed which could be attributed to a simple monomer-dimer equilibrium, and association (k1) and dissociation (k-1) rate constants were determined. The results obtained are as follows: for insulin at 23 degrees C, pH 6.8, 0.125 M KNO3, k1 = 1.14 X 10(8) M-1 s-1, k-1 - 1.48 X 10(4)s(-1); for beta-lactoglobulin AB at 35 degrees C, pH 3.7, 0.025 M KNO3, d1 = 4.7 X 10(4) M-1 s-1, k-1 = 2.1 s-1; for alpha-chymotrypsin at 25 degreesC, pH 4.3, 0.05 M KNO3 k1 - 3.7 X 10(3) M-1 s-1, k-1 - 0.68 s-1. The kinetic behavior of the separated beta-lactoglobulin A and B was similar to that of the mixture. In the case of chymotrypsin, bromophenol blue was found to activate the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate, and a rate process was observed with the temperature jump which could be attributed to a conformational change of the indicator-protein complex. The association rate constant for dimer formation of insulin approaches the value expected for a diffusion-controlled process, while the values obtained for the other two proteins are below those expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction unless unusally large steric and electrostatic effects are present.\n",
      "Ionophore A23187: the effect of H+ concentration on complex formation with divalent and monovalent cations and the demonstration of K+ transport in mitochondria mediated by A23187. The two-phase extraction technique has been used to study the equilibrium between A23187, metal cations, and H+. Under these conditions the ionophore forms charge neutral isostoichiometric complexes with divalent cations in which both carboxylate groups of the 2:1 A23187:M2+ complexes are deprotonated. In ethanol, however, the methyl ester of A23187 also binds divalent cations indicating that protonated complexes between A23187 and cations should also exist. With monovalent cations, A23187 forms two charge-neutral complexes of stoichiometries and relative stabilities: A2HM greater than AM. Examination of energy utilization K+ and H+ movements, and light scattering capacity of mitochondria in the presence of divalent cation chelators, A23187, and valinomycin demonstrates that A23187 can act as a nigericin type K+ ionophore under appropriate conditions. Formation constants for the A2HM complexes with monovalent cations indicate that with appropriate conditions transport of Li+ and Na+ mediated by A23187 would also be expected. The binding constant data and associated free energies of complex formation are compared as a function of ionic radius and of cation charge. The data indicate that lack of conformational mobility in A23187 is responsible for the high cation size selectivity of this compound. To explain the transport selectivity of A23187 for divalent cations, it is proposed that this ionophore forms a family of five complexes, isostoichiometric between cations of different valence but of which only charge-neutral species are permeant to membranes. The charge of a given complex is in turn determined by that of the cation. The concept is consistent with the divalent cation transport specificity of A23187, explains the observed monovalent cation transport, and is useful in rationalizing the differences in charge selectivity between A23187 and X-537A.\n",
      "Properties of the tetrodotoxin binding component in plasma membranes isolated from Electrophorus electricus. The biochemical properties of the electrically excitable sodium channels in the electroplaque of Electrophorus electricus were investigated using tritiated tetrodotoxin (TTX) as a specific membrane probe. Membrane fragments from the electroplaque were isolated essentially by differential centrifugation and characterized with respect to the plasma membrane markers acetylcholine receptors, acetylcholinesterase, (Na+ + K+)ATPase, and [3H]TTX binding. Equilibrium binding studies showed that [3H]TTX bound to a single population of noninteracting receptor sites with an apparent dissociation constant of 6 +/- 1 X 10(-9) M. The toxin-membrane complex dissociated with a first-order rate constant of 0.012 sec-1. Studies on the pH dependence of complex formation demonstrated the requirement for an ionizable, functional group with a pK of 5.3 and this group has been shown to be a carboxyl. Treatment of the membranes with trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate, a carboxyl group modifying reagent, resulted in an irreversible loss in the binding of [3H]TTX, which could be prevented by low concentrations of TTX or saxitoxin. This decrease was due to a reduction in the total number of binding sites and not to a decrease in toxin binding affinities. The relative binding affinities of various monovalent alkali metal and polyatomic cations for the TTX-receptor site showed that this site displayed cation discrimination properties which were similar to those reported previously for the electrically excitable sodium channel in intact nerve fibers. A possible role for this site in the ion selectivity of the sodium channel is proposed.\n",
      "The arrangement of subunits in cholera toxin. Cholera toxin consists of five similar B subunits of apparent molecular weight about 10 600 and one A subunit (29 000) consisting of two peptides (A1 23 000-24 000 and A2 about 5500) linked by a single disulfide bond. Each B subunit also contains one internal disulfide bond which is readily reduced but is protected from carboxymethylation unless the reduced subunits are heated in urea. Tyrosine residues in A1 and in B subunits are readily iodinated, but the intact B assembly does not react with iodine. Upon reaction with the cross-linking reagent dimethyl suberimidate, B subunits may be covalently connected to each other, to A1 and to A2. A1 and A2 may also be cross-linked. The B subunits are probably arranged in a ring with A on the axis. A2 is required for the re-assembly of toxin from its subunits and may serve to hold A1 on the B ring. The maximum activity of cholera toxin in vitro is obtained only when the active peptide, A1, is separated from the rest of the molecule. Such separation, and the insertion of A1 into the cytosol, must follow the binding of the complete toxin, through component B, to the exterior of intact cells. This binding increases the effective concentration of the toxin in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Possible ways in which A1 then crosses the membrane are considered in the Discussion.\n",
      "Kinetics of reaction of anions with methemerythrin derivatives. The kinetics of anation of methemerythrin over a wide range of pH and concentration of anions have been studied at 25 degrees C. The azide and thiocyanate ions have been most intensively investigated but experiments with fluoride and chloride are also reported. The replacement of anion in methemerythrin-anionic adducts by other anions has also been studied. Except for replacement of met-fluoride by azide, all replacements can be explained by a dissociative mechanism via the aquated species. Anations are second-order and an associative mechanism is preferred. The second-order rate constant decreases with increasing anion concentrations (from 20 muM to 20 mM). This is attributed to the effect of a secondary anion binding site. The behavior of octameric and monomeric forms of the protein toward thiocyanate is identical. A comparison of results with simple Fe(III) complexes and certain metalloproteins is made.\n",
      "Comparative studies on the structure and aggregative properties of the myosin molecule. III. The in vitro aggregative properties of the lobster myosin molecule. The solubility of rabbit skeletal and lobster abdominal muscle myosin has been studied in monovalent salt solutions as a function of pH (over the range 4.75 to 8.5) and ionic strength (50-500 mM). Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin was found to precipitate over a narrower pH range than the lobster abdominal muscle myosin but at equivalent pH values and ionic strengths the former exhibited greater solubility. Comparison of the solubility of rabbit myosin, per se with that of light meromyosin and lobster myosin with its equivalent proteolytically produced fragment (fraction B1) showed that both rod fragments were more soluble than their parent molecules. Under conditions of low solubility (low ionic strength and pH) the quantitiy of protein in solution remained essentially constant with increasing total protein, thus suggesting that the aggregation phenomenon is of a phase transition type. Examination of the aggregates by electron microscopy revealed that rabbit myosin formed classical, elongate, spindle-shaped filaments similar to those previously observed by others. In contrast lobster myosin only formed short, dumbbell-shaped filaments 0.2-0.3 mum long. Consideration of the pH ranges over which aggregation occurred suggests that protonation of histidine residues may be involved in rabbit myosin filament formation while for lobster myosin, aggregation may involve protonation of epsilon-amino or guanidino groups. The possible relationship between the distribution of these groups along the rod portion of the myosin molecule and the formation of elongate filaments has been explored.\n",
      "Properties of cholera toxin- and NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase from mouse thymocytes. Kinetic parameters of mouse thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity were determined. NaF and cholera toxin stimulated adenylate cyclase. Stimulation by either agent did not change the pH or Mg2+ optima relative to control (unstimulated cyclase). The Km value for ATP of adenylate cyclase stimulated by NaF was significantly reduced from control. By contrast, cholera toxin treatment did not change the Km relative to control. Adenylate cyclase, when stimulated by NaF, had an optimum for Mn2+ alone, or Mn2+ in combination with Mg2+, at least twice that of control. In contrast, cyclase activity prepared from cells treated with cholera toxin remained unchanged with regard to these divalent cations when compared to control. Addition of NaF to adenylate cyclase prepared from cells treated with cholera toxin resulted in a significant reduction (30%) in activity suggesting that both NaF and cholera toxin were acting on the same cyclase. NaF inhibition of cholera toxin-stimulated activity was shown to be a direct interaction of fluoride on the stimulated cyclase enzyme. This inhibition appeared to be immediate and independent on pH, Mg2+ or ATP concentrations. Although NaF inhibition was lost when Mn2+ was present in the reaction mixture, the activity expressed by addition of NaF to cyclase prepared from cholera toxin-treated cells was much less than by addition of NaF to control. As observed with cholera toxin stimulation alone, activity expressed by the inhibited enzyme (cholera toxin treated + NaF) exhibited a Km for ATP and an optimum for Mn2+ alone or in combination with Mg2+ similar to control.\n",
      "Regulation of the NADH and NADPH-ferredoxin oxidoreductases in clostridia of the butyric group. NADH and NADPH-ferredoxin oxidoreductases have been studied in Clostridium acetobutylicum, Cl. tyrobutyricum and Cl. pasteurianum. The study of the distribution and regulation of these enzymatic activities in well-defined culture conditions, reveals that the essential function of NADPH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase is to produce NADPH, while NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase can, depending on cellular conditions, produce or oxidize NADH. When these Clostridia use glycolysis, regulation of the NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase by acetyl-CoA (obligatory activator of NADH-ferroxin reductase activity) and by NADH (competitive inhibitor of ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase activity) allow the enzymes to function correlatively with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and thus control the levels of NAD+ and NADH in the cell. In Cl. tyrobutyricum and Cl. pasteurianum, the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase  activities are regulated by NAD+ and NADH in accordance with the intracellular concentrations of these coenzymes. In Cl. tyrobutyricum growing on pyruvate/acetate, NADH and NADPH-ferredoxin reductase activities cannot be detected; only the ferredoxin-NAD+ and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase activities are found. In this Clostridium, regulation of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase activity is the same whether it is grown on glucose or pyruvate. Contrary to this, the ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase activity undergoes a drastic change, since NADH no longer controls the enzymatic activity. In this case regulation is no longer necessary, since glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase does not function.\n",
      "Lysophospholipase activity in cell-wall fragments contaminating mitochondrial fractions of Neurospora crassa. Crude mitochondrial preparations from Neurospora crassa contain high levels of lysophospholipase (EC 3.1.1.5) activity when assayed with lysophosphatidylcholine as a substrate. In mitochondria purified by centrifugation on a sucrose-density gradient this activity is virtually absent. The enzyme was shown to be linked to a contaminating cell fraction which mainly consists of cell-wall material as was demonstrated by electron microscopy and chemical analysis. The enzyme has no absolute Ca2+ requirement but it is slightly stimulated by 10 mM CaCl2. The pH optimum is 5.8 in presence of CaCl2 and is shifted to 4.2 when EDTA is present. In contrast to other lysophospholipases this enzyme is only slightly inhibited by deoxycholate. This detergent is able to release part of the lysophospholipase activity from the wall fragments without producing an increase in specific activity. The enzyme is possibly secreted by the cells as high lysophospholipase activities were also found in the culture medium.\n",
      "Purification and properties of cholesterol ester hydrolase from human aortic intima and media. 1. Cholesterol ester hydrolase of human aortic intima and media was isolated and purified about 650-fold with 10-15% recovery of the original activity by sequential precipitation with 35% acetone, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. 2. Two pH optima of 4.5-5.0 and 7.0-7.5 were consistently observed for the partially purified cholesterol ester hydrolase of human aortic intima and media. 3. In the system used in the present study, the increasing concentration of emulsifiers, sodium taurocholate and phosphatidylcholine, inhibited the activity of the neutral enzymes but not on the acid enzymes. On the contrary, reaction products, cholesterol and oleic acid, were much more inhibitory on the acid enzymes than on the neutral ones. 4. Results of studies on the effect of presentation of substrate on the enzyme activity and on the difference between acid and neutral enzymes are also discussed.\n",
      "Effect of maternal diet on fetal hepatic lipogenesis. The effects of: a, maternal diet; b, cyclic-3',5'-adenosinemonophosphate (cyclic AMP) and c, clofibrate on hepatic lipogenesis in fetal rats were studied. The experimental diets contained 22% protein, 40--50% carbohydrate, adequate vitamins, and minerals. In addition, the fat-containing diets were supplemented with either 15% corn oil, 25% corn oil, or 5% cholesterol + 10% oleic acid. In the clofibrate feeding studies, 0.3% (w/v) of the ethyl ester was added to a stock ration or to fat-free diet. Lipogenesis was measured in liver slices incubated with [2-14C]pyruvate, [1-14C]acetate, or 3H2O. In addition, activities of lipogenic enzymes were measured in cytosol fractions from liver homogenates. The effec-s of the experimental diets on liver composition were also examined. Lipogenic activity was higher in fetal than in maternal liver. When 15% corn oil was added to the maternal diet, fatty acid synthesis in fetal liver did not decrease as it did in maternal liver. Maternal fasting decreased fetal fatty acid synthesys by 50% when measured with 14C and less than 10% when measured with 3H2O. Although the addition of cholesterol to the maternal diet decreased cholesterol synthesis in maternal liver, no such decrease was observed in fetal liver. Changes in enzyme activities paralleled alterations in lipogenesis in maternal but not in fetal liver. Corn oil feeding or fasting increased the rate of transfer of linoleate from the dam to the fetus. However, accumulation of linoleate in fetal liver did not correlate with a decreased rate of fatty acid synthesis as it did in maternal liver. Maternal hepatic glycogen stores were depleted by fasting, but glycogen levels in fetal liver remained high under these conditions.\n",
      "Translational control of protein synthesis in stimulated WI-38 fibroblasts. A cell-free protein synthesis system employing ribosomes from WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts was developed and its optimum MgC12 and KC1 levels and pH value found. The rate at which ribosomes are able to incorporate radioactive leucine into proteins ([14C]leucine incorporation/10 min/100 mug rRNA) and the number of growing peptide chains [3H]puromycinpeptides formed/100 mug rRNA) was determined. When confluent monolayers of WI-38 cells were stimulated to proliferate by serum, a transient increase in the rate of peptide elongation by ribosomes was observed at 60 min after stimulation. This increase was not affected by the presence of actinomycin D (10 mug/ml) in the stimulating medium. A change in the relative amount of certain ribosome-associated proteins accompanied the increased elongation rate of peptide growth. The alteration in associated proteins could not be accounted for by an increased synthesis of protein. Finally, the early activation of ribosomes in stimulated WI-38 cells appears to result from the removal of an inhibitor(s) of ribosome function.\n",
      "A non-equilibrium thermodynamics analysis of active transport within the framework of the chemiosotic theory. The proton circuit devised by Mitchell in the chemiosmotic theory was subjected to analysis using the formalism of irreversible thermodynamics. The phenomenological coefficients and the degree of coupling relating co-permeant flows were derived from anion/H+, substrate/H+, cation/H+ and anion/anion biporter models. Linearity and equality of the cross-coefficients in Onsager relations were always satisfied. Macroscopic flows leading to charges splitting, such as oxido-reduction, hydro-dehydratation and transhydrogenase, are driven by a composite thermodynamic force which includes the proton-motive component. Multiple coupling occurs in the circuit when it is assumed that the net inward flux of protons becomes zero, i.e. when the circulation of protons reaches a stationary state. Under these conditions, oxidative phosphorylation, ATPase- or respiration-linked transhydrogenase and uptake of anion or cation against their electrochemical gradient may be predicted, in agreement with known experimental evidence.\n",
      "Kinetics of the slow variation of peak sodium current in the membrane of myelinated nerve following changes of holding potential or extracellular pH. (1) Changes of the holding potential applied to the membrane of myelinated nerve fibres induced slow variations of the peak sodium current, which are super-imposed on the effect of sodium inactivation. (2) These slow variations are transitions between various steady levels of available sodium conductance. Their time course can be described by the function erfc (square root t/tau) where tau is the time and erfc the error function complement. The characteristic time tau lies in the range 2-4 min and depends on the membrane potential. (3) Changes of extracellular pH cause a rapid change of the peak sodium current followed by a slow variation as observed after changes of the holding potential. This slow variation can be prevented by applying simultaneously an appropriate change of the holding potential, e.g. the effect of changing pH from 7.3 to 5.3 is balanced by changing the potential from --70 to --55 mV. (4) The results are interpreted by postulating charged components diffusion slowly within the nodal membrane. Their transverse distribution controls the number of sodium channels available at a given membrane potential. The equivalence between change of pH and voltage is explained by assuming negative fixed charges at the outer surface of the membrane, which are protonated at low pH and thus affect the intrinsic membrane potential. (5) It is concluded that effects which are ascribed to the action of agents on individual sodium channels have to be corrected for variations in the number of available channels if these agents influence the intrinsic membrane potential, e.g. changes of extracellular pH.\n",
      "Effects of pH during recombination of human erythrocyte membrane apoprotein and lipid. The recombinates from human red cell membrane proteins and lipids resulting from dialysis of the components in 2-chloroethanol against aqueous buffers from pH2-12 have been studied by density gradient centrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Between pH 4 and 10 most of the proteins were found in the recombinates whereas below pH 4 and above pH 10 only part of them were recovered in the lipoprotein band after density gradient centrifugation. At low pH, increasing incorporation of the \"major glycoprotein\" into the recombinates was detected by gel electrophoresis and in parallel increasing amounts of particles were found in the freeze-fracture membrane faces. The necessity of working at low pH values from pH 2-4, however, and a critical evaluation of all the data presently available leads to the conclusion that the 2-choloroethanol technique is not adequate for recombination studies tending to membrane reconsitution.\n",
      "[pH dependence and EPR spectra of Fe-NO complexes with purines and pyrimidines]. Equilibria between different types of Fe(I)-dinitrosyl complexes with nucleobases in solution were studied by means of EPR spectroscopy. Computer simulation and 15NO isotopic substitution were used in order to make easier the interpretation of complicated EPR patterns. The pH dependence of the purine and pyrimidine complexes was investigated. Several EPR signals, under slow exchange conditions, were present in the range of pH values of biological significance. Four types of complexes were identified on the basis of the nuclear hyperfine structure: B' = where two purine molecules were bound to iron via N-7 in the imidazole ring; B'' = where two mercapto-base molecules were bound to iron via S-; B''' = where one mercapto-base molecule was bound to iron via S- and another via pyrimidine-nitrogen; B* = where two pyrimidine molecules were bound to iron via pyrimidine-nitrogen.\n",
      "Maximization of steady-state bacterial production in a chemostat with pH and substrate control. This analytical study deals with the steady-state behavior and control of microbial growth in continuous cultures. A second order Haldane-Monod model of continuous cultures is used as a basis for study of the effects of the adjustment of pH by the addition of acidic (or basic) materials. The treatment of a hydrogen ion concentration, in addition to substrate and microbial concentrations as state variables, results in a third order system of equations describing the process. The analysis of the system in equilibrium yields several admissible steady states, that is, steady states which satisfy all constraints. An optimal control problem is formulated and subsequently solved to maximize steady-state microbial production.\n",
      "Preparation and properties of soluble-insoluble nicotinamide coenzymes. A soluble-insoluble form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which can be rendered either soluble or insoluble by simply adjusting the pH, has been prepared by covalently coupling NAD to alginic acid using 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane. The NAD bound to the alginic acid showed the coenzymic function in the soluble state and could be collected for further use as precipitate by lowering the pH to below 3. Coupling soluble-insoluble coenzymes with insolubilized apoenzymes is possible in fluidized and fixed-bed reactors.\n",
      "Studies on some lipogenic enzymes of cultured myeloid leukemic cells. The microsomal fraction of M1 cells (an established cell line of myeloid leukemia) was capable of catalyzing acylation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate by long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesters. The principal lipid product formed was identified as phosphatidic acid. Palmityl-CoA, stearyl-CoA, and oleyl-CoA were more effective acyl donors than linoleyl-CoA and arachidonyl-CoA. M1 cells and macrophages differentiated from them exhibited similar levels of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate-acylating activity, which were approximately one-half that in mouse liver and approximately four times that in peritoneal macrophages. The levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in M1 cells and macrophages differentiated from them were not significantly different from each other and were comparable to those in mouse liver, whereas no activity was detected in peritoneal macrophages. These results indicated that differentiation of the myeloid leukemic cells, which results in loss of leukemogenicity and mitotic activity, is not associated with changes in the activities of these lipogenic enzymes, although the cultured cells exhibited remarkably higher activities than freshly harvested peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, the present study supports the view that the glycerophosphate pathway makes an essential contribution to the de novo synthesis of phospholipids in M1 cells, as well as in both types of macrophages.\n",
      "Impairment in the hepatic clearance of (35S)-bromosulphophthalein in paracetamol-intoxicated rats. 1 The overall functional capacity of the liver was evaluated using [35S]-bromosulphophthalein (BSP, 100 mg/kg, i.v.) in biliary fistulated adult rats pretreated orally with different doses of paracetamol (APAP) for varying time intervals. 2 The maximal hepatic damage occurred between 12-18 h after single doses of APAP (0.5 or 1 g/kg); hepatic excretory function returned to control levels by 48-72 hours. 3 Administration of either 0.5 or 1 g/kg APAP 18 h before BSP caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the choleretic effect of BSP and of the 60 min cumulative excretion of the dye, but conversely, produced a significant increase in the liver and plasma concentrations of 35S. 4 Following acute (0.25 g/kg), or subacute (0.5 g/kg, twice daily for 7 days) treatment with APAP, the total excretion of 35S in bile and the retention of 35S in the liver or plasma remained essentially the same as that for the controls. 5 In rats given single doses of 1 g/kg APAP, the hepatic uptake of the dye was significantly increased during the early stages of intoxication, while the opposite effect was observed at late periods. 6 The bile flow appeared to be inversely related to the excretion of unchanged BSP, and directly related to the excretion of the major BSP conjugate in bile. 7 The hepatic clearance of BSP was more rapid in rats treated subacutely with 0.5 or 1 g/kg APAP, than in those treated acutely with equal doses, suggesting that the intensity of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity became less severe after the repeated administration of this drug. 8 It is concluded that the hepatic uptake, metabolism and excretion of BSP are reversibly impaired following APAP-induced liver injury.\n",
      "Dual effect of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists in rat isolated vas deferens. 1 In rat isolated vas deferens, the isotonic contractile responses to low doses of noradrenaline or adrenaline were antagonized, and those to high doses were potentiated, by yohimbine, piperoxan, phentolamine and tolazoline. Effects due to intermediate doses were not affected, or were potentiated within about 30 min, following an initial inhibition. 2 The alpha-adrenoceptor blockers thus caused a shift to the right and an increase of the maximum height of log dose-response curves of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants. For a given dose of antagonist, the onset was slower for the potentiating than for the blocking effect. 3 The shift to the right induced by piperoxan and yohimbine on dose-response curves of noradrenaline and adrenaline was analysed with the Schild plot, and the slopes obtained, around 0.3, were lower than expected from receptor theory. When cocaine was used to block neuronal uptake, the slopes were close to 1.0. 4 The increase in maximum response to noradrenaline and adrenaline induced by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers was dependent on the time of incubation, on the dose of antagonist, and on the initial height of responses to the agonist. A less pronounced potentiation was also obtained when acetylcholine was used as agonist. 5 The findings are explained in terms of receptor theory as being due to a dual effect of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists; competitive antagonism proper, which may be disclosed after blockade of neuronal uptake, and an interaction at a different locus, which results in potentiation of the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline.\n",
      "[Isotopic study of fluid and electrolyte disturbances in decompensated chronic respiratory insufficiency (author's transl)]. The study of fluid and electrolyte disturbances by isotope radiodilution method is carried out in 22 patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency and cardiac failure. The simultaneous measurements of hydro-ionic compartments have been carried out with tritiated water (HTO), labelled sodium (22Na), labelled potassium (42K) and labelled bromine (82Br). From these measurements, the various water spaces are calculated: total water (ET) and extracellular fluids (LEC), also exchangeable electrolytes: sodium (NaE), potassium (KE), chlorine (ClE) and derived values. Results are compared to corresponding values in controls with the same obesity index. Patients with respiratory insufficiency show a fluid and sodium rise, similar to that found in cardiac failure and denutrition. The (NaE + KE)/ET ratio is not significantly decreased and the natremia is only slightly lower. There is no real potassium depletion in most patients.\n",
      "[Role of P50 in resuscitation (author's transl)]. The amount of oxygen made available to the tissues of the body depends essentially upon pulmonary gas exchanges, cardiac output and its regional distribution, haemoglobin concentration and also upon the oxygen affinity of the haemoglobin molecule. That a standard oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve faithfully describes oxygen loading and unloading both in healthy subjects and in those suffering from pathological process has come under attack. Beside the effect of pH, PCO2 and temperature, the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve can be modified by alterations of other factors (concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, hormones, drugs). Although the shifts of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, expressed by variations of P50 may seem minute, the effect of these shifts, expressed in terms of the \"functional value of haemoglobin\" are very large. Assessment of the intensive care patient must take into account the effect of alterations of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve which can either increase or diminish tissue oxygenation.\n",
      "[Acid-base disorders in status asthmaticus (author's transl)]. In 85 patinets withstatus asthmaticus, the authors have studied the acid-base balance, the blood gas tensions and various humoral parameters. The values were classified into two groups according to the PaCO2 level: below or equal to 44 torr (Group I), higher than 44 torr (Group II). In the 58 cases of Group II, there was a very close positive correlation between PaCO2 and H + ions, practically the same as that established by BRACKETT et al. [3] in experimental acute hypercapnia in man. On the contrary, the correlation derived from cases of status asthmaticus in the literature showed, in some cases, a metabolic component in acidosis. In the present work, the mean value of lactates was close to normal; there was a slow increase in protein content and hematocrit, in the two groups. The prognosis of the status asthmaticus depends on the degrees of hypercapnia: when it reaches 70 torr, mechanical ventilation is urgently needed and is the main part of the treatment; the use of additional drugs remains a matter of specific case.\n",
      "The evaluation of the novel pressor activity of gamma-piperidinobutyramide (WY 20051, DF480). 1 gamma-Piperidinobutyramide (Wy 20051, DF480) injected intravenously evoked pressor responses in the anaesthetized ganglion blocked rat preparation over the dose range 2.4 x 10(-6)-3.0 x 10(-4) mol/kg. 2 High doses (greater than 3.8 x 10(-5) mol/kg) or even repeated submaximal doses (1.9 x 10(-5) mol/kg) of Wy 20051 caused tachyphylaxis of this pressor response. 3 The noradrenaline pressor-response curve was shifted significantly to the right of the control curve following a dose of Wy 20051 (1.5 x 10(-4) mol/kg cumulative). 4 The dose-response curve for the pressor action of Wy 20051 was potentiated in reserpine-treated anaesthetized rats. In contrast, tyramine-induced pressor responses were abolished. 5 Wy 20051 contracted the guinea-pig isolated aortic spiral preparation (3.8 x 10(-5)-6.0 x 10(-4) mol) and evoked constrictor responses in the perfused mesenteric vasculature preparation of the rat (5.9 x 10(-7)-1.2 x 10(-5) mol). At higher doses the responses were reduced. 6 Wy 20051-induced constrictor responses of the perfused mesentery were unaffected by blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors or by tachyphylaxis of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors. 7 The time for abolition of Wy 20051-induced constrictor responses of the mesentery in a calcium-free medium was not significantly different from that required for noradrenaline, but was significantly greater than that for KCl (P less than 0.001). 8 Wy 20051 and noradrenaline, but not KCl, evoked constrictor responses in the depolarized rat mesenteric vasculature. 9 The results indicate that Wy 20051 evokes pressor responses which have some of the characteristics of those of noradrenaline. However, the responses are not elicited by an alpha-adrenoceptor mechanism.\n",
      "Electroconvulsive shock increases the behavioural responses of rats to brain 5-hydroxytryptamine accumulation and central nervous system stimulant drugs. 1 A single electroconvulsive shock (ECS) of 150 V for 1 s increased the concentration of rat brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) but did not alter brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or tryptophan concentrations 3 h later. 2 A single ECS decreased 5-HT synthesis 3 h and 6 h later. Synthesis was back to normal after 24 hours. The ECS-treated rats did not show greater hyperactivity produced by the increased brain 5-HT accumulation following administration of L-tryptophan and tranylcypromine at any time up to 24 h later. This suggests that a single electroshock does not alter 5-HT functional activity. 3 Twenty-four hours after the final ECS of a series of 10 shocks given once daily, the rats were given tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan. They displayed greater hyperactivity than control rats not treated with ECS, suggesting that ECS increases 5-HT functional activity. Brain concentrations of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and tryptophan were then unchanged by ECS. 5-HT synthesis and accumulation of 5-HT following tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan were not altered by ECS. 4 The hyperactivity following administration of the 5-HT agonist 5-methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine was enhanced by repeated (10 day) ECS, suggesting altered post-synaptic responses to 5-HT receptor stimulation. 5 Repeated ECS enhanced locomotor activity following tranylcypromine and L-DOPA. It did not alter brain noradrenaline or dopamine concentrations. 6 The latent period before a pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion was shortened by repeated ECS. 7 Following repeated ECS there appears to be increased neuronal sensitivity to certain stimuli producing centrally mediated behavioural stimulation. This is discussed in relation to the mechanism by which electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) produces its therapeutic effect.\n",
      "Effects of chronic nicotine administration on the denervated rat adrenal medulla. 1 The effects of chronic nicotine administration (1 or 10 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily) were studied in intact and denervated rat adrenal glands to determine the relative roles of central input and direct actions on catecholamines. 2 Catecholamine depletion was obtained in the intact glands from 1-7 days of treatment with 10 mg/kg, with recovery by 14 days of treatment; catecholamines were not decreased in denervated adrenal glands. 3 Catecholamine depletion was accompanied by a decline in functional storage vesicles (determined by [3H]-adrenaline uptake per gland) in the intact side, while no change was seen in the denervated side; the proportion of newly synthesized vesicles increased markedly during 1-7 days of treatment with 10 mg/kg in the intact side, while a much smaller increase of shorter duration was seen in the denervated adrenal gland. 4 Chronic nicotine administration at either dose level induced tyrosine hydroxylase in both intact and denervated glands, but the increase occurred more slowly in the denervated glands. 5 Dopamine beta-hydroxylase levels increased similarly in both sides during treatment with nicotine (10 mg/kg). 6 These studies suggest that although long-term adrenal denervation eliminates the catecholamine depletion caused by chronic administration of nicotine, the mechanisms for induction of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes are still capable of responding to the drug.\n",
      "Catechol O-methyltransferase in red blood cells of schizophrenic, depressed, and normal human subjects. Catechol O-methyltransferase of lysed human red blood cells was assayed under optimal conditions, using saturating concentrations of the substrates, S-adenosyl-L-methionine and 3-4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The mean enzyme activity found in 24 normal subjects was 29-2 nmol/hr/ml RBC. The mean activity in blood of 33 female unipolar depressives was not significantly different from normal. However, higher enzyme activities were observed in the blood of 11 schizophrenic patients (38-9 nmol/hr/ml RBC). Partially purified enzyme preparations from blood of normal and schizophrenic individuals were indistinguishable with respect to substrate specificities, isoelectric pH values, and ratios of the two O-methylated products. Therefore it is unlikely that any defect in O-methylation which may occur in schizophrenia can be attributed to a change in the intrinsic properties of erythrocyte catechol O-methyltransferase.\n",
      "The expectation of outcome from maintenance therapy in chronic schizophrenic patients. The results from a prospective follow-up study of a group of schizophrenic patients suggest that a significant proportion (41 per cent) are likely to relapse during a two-year period despite the prescription of long-acting injectable neuroleptic drugs. Some will relapse because of a failure of the regime, but others (32-37 per cent) because the pharmacological protection of these drugs would appear to be less effective in certain patients. Even with the major advantages of the long-acting injectable neuroleptics over oral medication, the schizophrenic patient population remains a group with a high incidence of psychiatric and social morbidity which continues to require the full resources of both the hospital and community services.\n",
      "Salicylates and renal function in rheumatoid arthritis. The effect of salicylate treatment on the kidney, particularly medullary function, was investigated. In a retrospective analysis patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with high doses of salicylates were shown to have inferior urinary concentrating power and increased excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) when compared with patients who had not received salicylate treatment. A prospective study of renal funcition in healthy people and patients with RA starting salicylate in therapeutic doses showed that while epithelial cell excretion was only transiently raised in both groups the excretion of NAG was increased in all cases at three days and this increase was sustained at 10 days, all values being much higher in the patients than in the healthy subjects. Thus salicylate treatment does cause renal tubular damage but this damage results in only minimal impairment of function and does not constitute a reason for withholding salicylate treatment.\n",
      "Benzodiazepine drugs in general medical patients. Data from a hospital-based drug surveillance programme were used to determine how often benzodiazepine drugs were used in general medical wards. Benzodiazepines were the drugs most commonly used as hypnotics and were given to 32% of these patients. Concomitant use of more than one benzodiazepine drug or of benzodiazepines with other psychoactive drugs was common and often irrational. A series of double-blind patient-preference studies comparing various benzodiazepines and a benzodiazepine with an antihistamine showed that for short-term hypnotic effect there were no differences between three common benzodiazepines but elderly patients preferred benzodiazepines to the antihistamine, which produced more undesired effects. These results suggest that currently diazepam is the hypnotic of choice for medical ward inpatients.\n",
      "Decrease of uptake and exchange of neurotransmitter amino acids after depletion of their synaptosomal pools. Synaptosomes prelabeled at 37 degrees C with radioactive amino acids (GABA, glutamate, glycine, taurine, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, phenylalanine, leucine) and then washed at 0 degrees C on Millipore filters (DAWP 02500) lost 60-70% of the accumulated radioactivity. The loss was similar with exogenous tritiated GABA and glutamate, and with [14C]GABA and [14C]glutamate metabolically derived from [14C]glucose. In contrast, radioactive norepinephrine, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine were almost totally retained by cold shocked synaptosomes. After pretreatment with reserpine and nialamide the loss of norepinephrine became significantly greater (about 25%). The uptake of radioactive GABA, glutamate and clycine after cold shock was about 50% reduced, whereas that of radioactive biogenic amines was less affected (reduction of 22% for norepinephrine, 29% for 5-hydroxytryptamine and 35% for dopamine). The loss of amino acids and the reduction of uptake could be minimized by performing the cold shock in hypertonic conditions. In synaptosomes prelabeled with [3H]GABA, a good correlation was observed among magnitude of amino acid pool depletion induced by cold shock or by 56 mM KCl, decrease of subsequent accumulation of [14C]GABA, and decrease of [14C]-GABA-stimulated [3H]GABA release (homoexchange).\n",
      "Ultrastructural hypoxic changes in Ammon's horn and Purkinje cells. Guinea pigs were exposed for varying periods to different degrees of hypoxia by respiration of controlled mixtures of O2-N2 and the CNS subjected to both light and electron microscopic examination after aldehyde fixation by perfusion. The subacute anoxia experiments revealed an alteration in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the Purkinje cells consisting of the formation of 'paired cisternae'. In the chronic anoxia experiments, small ultrastructural alterations of the same cells were found in association with the appearance of monoparticulate glycogen. The authors debate the significance of these ultrastructural alterations in relation to the damage found in other organs.\n",
      "The effect of taget organ removal on the development of sympathetic neurons. The role of target organs in the maturation of adrenergic neurons was studied in the neonatal rat. The superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and its end organs, the salivary glands and iris were employed as a model system. Unilateral sialectomy and iridectomy in 3-day-old animals prevented the normal development of ganglion tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH) and DOPA decarboxylase activities. These enzymes are highly localized to adrenergic neurons in the SCG, and were used to monitor maturation of these cells. Enzyme activity remained depressed for at least two months, the longest time tested. In contrast, total ganglion protein, a measure of ganglion growth as a whole, initially developed normally. Six weeks after surgery, however, protein content was significantly lower in ganglia deprived of the normal field of innervation. Failure of normal enzyme maturation was apparently dependent on removal of ipsilateral end organs only, since bilateral sialectomy exerted no greater effect than unilateral sialectomy. In adults, unilateral sialectomy and iridectomy did not significantly alter ganglion T-OH activity or protein in rats followed up to one month after surgery.\n",
      "Sensitization and habituation of the plantar cushion reflex in cats. The plantar cushion reflex in cats was examined as a model system in a mammal for the study of the effects of repeated stimulation on neural transmission. Effects of various frequencies and intensities of stimulation were similar to those seen in other reflex systems. For instance, for a fixed number of stimuli, habituation of the plantar cushion reflex was more marked at 10 Hz than at 2.0 Hz, and with 1.0 X threshold stimulation than with 5.0 X threshold stimulation. Sensitization occurred at intermediate intensities and frequencies of stimulation. Dorsal root potentials were studied; changes in dorsal root potentials during iterated stimulation did not correlate with the changes in the plantar cushion reflex. These changes in the plantar cushion reflex were also unrelated to variations in afferent transmission peripheral to the spinal cord. Sensitization and habituation in the plantar cushion reflex occurred during iterated stimulation, were produced centrally, and were unrelated to mechanisms of presynaptic inhibition.\n",
      "Quantitative localization of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, phenolethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, and glutamic acid decarboxylase in spinal cord. Sensitive radiometric assays for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) have been combined with microdissection techniques for quantitative localization of these synthetic enzymes in rabbit spinal cord. TH was present uniformly in gray and white matter. DBH was higher in the lateral horns than in the other gray matter areas, and was not detectable in white matter. PNMT was detectable in gray but not white matter, and was considerably lower in activity than the other catecholamine synthetic enzymes. GAD was higher in the dorsal horns at the cervical and lumbar levels than in other gray matter areas and relatively low in white matter. GAD activity was considerably higher than the catecholamine synthetic enzyme activities. The quantitative localizations are consistent with the qualitative immunohistochemical enzymes maps and distributions of the related putative neurotransmitters.\n",
      "Extraction of a calcium-phospholipid-phosphate complex from bone. A calcium-phospholipid-phosphate complex with a constant 1:1 calcium to total phosphate molar ratio is shown to exist in rabbit and calf bone. This complex, which may be involved in the transport and deposition of bone mineral, appears to constitute a significantly greater proportion of the lipids of younger bone than of more mature bone. The comples was isolated by a modified Folch extraction employing ultrasonic disruption of cellular material. Evidence is presented to show that the complex is a natural constituent of bone rather than one created artifactually during extraction.\n",
      "Magill circuit and controlled ventilation. Nine patients under anaesthesia were controlled manually with the Magill attachment. Nine other patients using the same circuit under anaesthesia breathed spontaneously. Blood gases were studied throughout the period of operation to determine the adequacy of ventilation. The results show that the Magill attachment was adequate for controlled ventilation using normal flows (9 1/min) in young healthy patients.\n",
      "The reduction of coma time in lipophilic drug overdose using castor oil. A clinical trial of castor oil in overdoses of lipophilic drugs gave a strong clinical impression that it was effective in speeding up recovery. Therefore, animal experiments were undertaken to confirm that castor oil acts as a ligand in Ethchlorvynol poisoning and that its use reduces coma time. Serial serum levels of Ethchlorvynol were obtained from dogs given Ethchlorvynol 150 mg/kg alone, and the same dose dissolved in castor oil 15 ml/kg in a crossover fashion. The result was a reduction of peak serum levels and of the half-life of the drug when the castor oil solution was used. In order to mimic the clinical situation more closely, a further crossover study was undertaken using Ethchlorvynol 300 mg/kg alone and the same dose followed by castor oil 15 ml/kg repeated q12h. This showed no delay in reaching peak serum concentration and no reduction of peak levels. However, it did show a 31 per cent reduction in the half-life of the drug. This change is statistically significant, and supports the continued use of castor oil in lipophilic drug overdose.\n",
      "An endogalactosaminidase from Streptomyces griseus. An endogalactosaminidase has been purified 34-fold from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces griseus. This enzyme cleaves GalN-GalN linkages in oligogalactosaminoglycan, a galactosamine-rich oligosaccharide isolated from the culture filtrate of a Neurospora mutant. Since some or all of the GalN-GalN bonds in this molecule link positions 1 and 4, and are in the alpha-configuration, we are probably dealing with an endo-alpha-(1 leads to 4)-galactosaminidase, bu this characterization is only tentative because the few bonds cleaved by the enzyme could have a different structure. The enzyme is inactive towards N-acetyl-oligogalactosaminoglycan and chitosan. The endogalactosaminidase preparations also cleave high molecular weight galactosaminoglycan (obtained from Neurospora) into fragments greater than or equal to 10(4) daltons in molecular weight, and catalyze the release of Neurospora sporelings from the glass surfaces to which they are anchored. Galactosaminoglycan-cleaving and sporeling-releasing activities elute jointly from DEAE-cellulose columns. This observation provides further support for an earlier proposal that the sporelings are anchored to the glass by means of galactosaminoglycan molecules.\n",
      "Fractionation of nucleolar proteins by two-dimensional gel electrphoresis. Isolation of nucleolar proteins was obtained by dissociation in the presence of urea-guanidine hydrochloride, followed by high-speed centrifugation to remove nucleic acids. At least 31 fractions of nucleolar proteins were detected by isoelectrofocusing gel electrophoresis in pH range 3.5-10. Following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels, more than 100 components of nucleolar proteins were identifieid. Two-thirds of nucleolar proteins were located in the pH range 5-8 following isoelectrofocusing. The molecular weights of these classes of proteins were shown to be mostly 30000-70000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\n",
      "Temperature-induced alanine oxidation in a psychrotrophic Pseudomonas. A psychrotrophic pseudomonad isolated from iced fish oxidized alanine at temperatures close to 0 degrees C and grew over the range 0 degrees C-35 degrees C. The rate of oxidation of alanine, measured manometrically, by cells grown at 2 degrees C was lower than that of cells grown at 22 degrees C. However, the consumption of oxygen after heat treatment at 35 degrees for 35 min was reduced considerably by 2 degrees C grown cells. Alanine oxidase activity was tested in an extract from cells grown at 2 degrees C and 22 degrees C with alanine as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. Cells grown at 2 degrees C produced an alanine oxidase with a temperature optimum of 35 degrees C and pH optimum of 8, which lost about 80% activity by heat treatment at 40 degrees C for 30 min. There was no change in activity after dialysis at pH 7, 8, or 9. Extracts from cells grown at 22 degrees C contained an alanine oxidase system with an optimum temperature of 45 degrees C, a pH optimum above 8, and only about 30% reduction of activity after heat treatment. This enzyme activity was concentrated in the 0.5 M elution fraction from a Sephadex column, and dialysis reduced the activity at pH 7 and 8. Mesophilic enzyme synthesis apparently started around a growth temperature of 10 degrees C. The crude alanine oxidase systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from cells grown at 13 degrees C and 37 degrees C had a common optimum temperature of 45 degrees C. These data suggest that one mechanism of psychrophilic growth by psychrotrophic bacteria may be the induction of enzymes with low optimum temperatures in response to low temperature conditions.\n",
      "Growth characteristics of a cell line derived from the pig oviduct. Further evidence for the establishment of the pig fallopian tube (PFT) cell line as a continuous cell line was shown by an increase in the maximum population density as the number of subcultures increased. The optimal pH and temperature-growth ranges appeared to be 7.4-7.8 and 37-41 degrees C respectively, and the population doubling time was 20-25 h under optimal growth conditions. With progressive subculture, the serum requirements dropped from 20 to 2%. A plating efficiency of 2 to 4% was found in all serial subcultures. Colonies were observed in agar suspension culture at the 146th subculture and thereafter. Chromosomal alterations were found in the 100th subculture and thereafter.\n",
      "Characteristics of a facultatively psychrophilic Acinetobacter species isolated from river sediment. A facultatively psychrophilic bacterium isolated from river sediment was identified as an Acinetobacter species, similar to those previously characterized as A. lwoffi. The strain was extremely lipolytic and hemolytic. Some action on crude oil was also observed. The organism was able to utilize a wide variety of carbon and energy sources when tested at both 20 and 30 degrees C. A comparison is made with the previously proposed type strain of A. lwoffi. The bacteria had a Gram-negative cell wall containing an electron-dense intermediate layer. Cell division occurred with the formation of a septum and slight constriction.\n",
      "Zoospore chemotaxis in Australian isolates of Phytophthora species. Zoospores of Australian isolates of Phytophthora drechsleri, P. cryptogea, P. cinnamomi, P. nicotianae var. parasitica, and P. citricola were examined for their chemotactic responses to asparagine, glutamine, aspartate, glutamate, and structurally related compounds. Structural requirements for attraction include the alpha-amino-acid group with a short carbon chain terminating in an amide group. The one American isolate tested gave a different result and possible reasons for this are discussed. The pH of the environment was important, a neutral-charged molecule was more attractive than a negatively charged molecule, hence glutamine and aspartate were more attractive at pH 3.0 than pH 5.0. Zoospores tended to move away from regions with a high hydrogen ion concentration. Compounds other than amino acids were slightly attractive including several sugars and ethanol. Synergistic interactions between amino acids, ethanol, and sucrose were observed and may account for the high levels of attraction of zoospores to root exudates and extracts.\n",
      "Double-blind evaluation of oral L-prolyl-Lleucyl-glycine amide in Parkinson's disease. A 4-month double-blind study comparing the effect of increasing oral doses (up to 1.0 g daily) of synthetic L-proyl-L-leucyl-glycine amide (PLG) and placebo in 20 parkinsonian patients showed no significant improvement in objective scores of functional disability. However, important trends and some significant results were observed with the lower doses of PLG. These essentially negative results may be attributed to poor intestinal absorption of the compound, a short biologic half-life in the blood, or administration of oral doses that were much higher than required, or a combination of factors. In further studies with this peptide, which are encouraged, the intravenous route should be used until the question of intestinal absorption is resolved.\n",
      "Carcinoid tumors of the thymus. Three patients with carcinoid tumors of the anterior mediastinum are described. Study of these patients and an analysis of previously reported cases indicates that the thymus is the primary site of these tumors, which are probably related to the presence of Kulchitsky cells in normal thymus. These neoplasms differ clinically and anatomically from conventional thymomas. They occur predominantly in men, are not associated with myasthenia gravis or red-cell hypoplasia, and are more aggressive tumors than thymomas. Histologically, they are similar to carcinoid tumors of other organs and differ from the variable combination of epithelial cells and lymphocytes of thymomas. Although they are usually locally invasive and frequently metastasize, the clinical course is usually protracted. It is probable that the reported examples of Cushing's syndrome related to thymomas were actually associated with thymic carcinoid tumors.\n",
      "Effects of hypoxia on distribution of cardiac output and organ blood flow in the rabbit. Regional vascular response to hypoxia. The hemodynamic responses of various vascular beds in the systemic circulation to prolonged moderate hypoxia were studied in the rabbit using the radioactive microsphere method. Although cardiac output remained unchanged, there was a redistribution of blood flow in which blood was mainly diverted from the kidneys to provide greater supply to heart, brain and skeletal muscle. These regional adjustments are similar to those seen after low cardiac output due to hemorrhage or endotoxic shock.\n",
      "Quenching of tryptophanyl fluorescence of human growth hormone by iodide. Quenching of tryptophanyl fluorescence of human growth hormone by I- followed saturation kinetics and was abolished by KSCN. In the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride quenching was linear between 0 to 0.2 M KI. These results suggest that I- quenched the fluorescence of the native hormone by binding at or near the single tryptophanyl residue. Quenching by 0.1 M KI decreased exponentially with increasing concentrations of human and bovine growth hormones. Acidification did not have a significant effect on quenching of the human hormone, but it markedly decreased quenching of the bovine hormone. Conformational differences at the vicinity of the lone tryptophanyl residue that could be inferred by these and other experiments may be contributing to the biological specificity of native human and bovine growth hormones.\n",
      "Comparison of the metabolism of benzo[alpha]pyrene and binding to DNA caused by rat liver nuclei and microsomes. Administration of 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) to rats greatly enhanced the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity of liver nuclei. However, the binding in vitro [3H]benzo[alpha]pyrene (BP) to DNA within the nuclei which occurred at the same time as hydroxylation of BP was much less enhanced. Thin layer chromatography of the metabolites of BP produced by these nuclei revealed the same metabolites in similar relative amounts as were produced by rat liver microsomes prepared from rats which had received 3MC. The binding to DNA was further analysed by hydrolysis of the DNA and fractionation on a Sephadex column. This analysis revealed that the binding to DAN in nuclei was very similar in nature to that which occurred when calf-thymus DNA was added to microsomes metabolising BP.\n",
      "Inhibition of nadph-driven microsomal lipid peroxidation by cytosol factor(s). Effect of a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet. Male Swiss mice were given free access to a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet. The liver cytosol fraction from these mice contained a heat-sensitive factor that markedly inhibited microsomal, ferric pyrophosphate stimulated, NADPH-driven lipid peroxidation. The diet-induced factor was apparently incorporated into the microsomes after 12 days of continuous feeding, since lipid peroxidation by these microsomes was strongly diminished. The factor disappeared from the cytosol after 24 h of fasting and reappeared after refeeding the mice with the fat-free, high carbohydrate diet.\n",
      "The repression and derepression of hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase by carcinogens. Like hydrocortisone, a single carcinogenic dose of dimethylnitrosamine (50 mg/kg) initiates the induction cycle for hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase in adrenalectomized rats. However, following this initial induction in the presence of dimethylnitrosamine, the enzyme becomes refractory to reinduction by known inducers. The administration of thioacetamide to either adrenalectomized or intact rats leads to an immediate and progressive loss of inducibility by hydrocortisone, dibutyrylcyclic AMP or dimethylnitrosamine. Although the thioacetamide-induced repression was not reversed even up to 10 weekds after the cessation of treatment, it was reversed after the induction of liver regeneration. Both the carcinogen-mediated induction and repression of tyrosine aminotransferase appears to occur by mechanisms which do not involve the corticosteroid-binding proteins which normally mediate the induction by glucocorticoids.\n",
      "[Effect of intratumoral injection of bacterial and viral neuraminidase in rats]. We studied the effect of neuraminidase injection in rat's tumor at different doses: 5,10,50,100, 500 U and we concluded that: There was no difference between the rats treated with 5,10,50 U and the controls. The y died 3 weeks after the injection. But the rats treated by 100 at 500 U of NA died quickley, in the week, of long metastases.\n",
      "[Changes in transmitter release at frog neuromuscular junction induced by 4-aminopyridine]. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) at micromolar concentrations, increases the end-plate potential amplitude in curarized preparations and the mean quantal content in every preparation tested, but the spontaneous release is not modified by 4-AP. These results can explain the anticurare activity observed in the wole animal or in vitro. 4-AP prolongs the falling phase of the muscle action potential without change in the muscle membrane potential.\n",
      "Contribution of tissue acidosis to ischemic injury in the perfused rat heart. The isolated perfused working rat heart preparation has been used to study the effects of respiratory acidosis on myocardial metabolism and contractilly. Hearts were perfused with 5 mM glucose and 10(-2) U/ml of insulin in order to enhance metabolsim of glucose relative to that of fatty acids. After perfusion with Krebs bicarbonate medium at pH 6.6, hearts rapidly ceased performing external work and peak left ventricular pressure fell by 75% after 5 minutes. Oxygen consumption, rate of ATP generation and overall glycolytic flux also declined rapidly. After about 2 minutes of perfusion, the fall of glycolytic flux showed a partial reversal, which was largely accounted for by increased lactate production, so that glucose oxidation decreased further. The reversal of glycoltic flux could be accounted for by partial release of H+ inhibition of phospho-fructokinase by increased tissue levels of adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and P1 and decreased levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate. The increased proportion of glucose uptake converted to lactate together with an increase of the tissue lactate/pyruvate ratio could be accounted for by inhibition of the malate-aspartate cycle combined with tissue hypoxia. Lactate accumulated in the tissue as a result of a decreased permeability of the plasma membrane to lactate. Decreased oxygen delivery to the myocardium was caused by secondary constriction of the coronary vessels. In further experiments, the coronary flow was regulated by an external pump which delivered fluid at a controlled rate into the aortic cannula above the coronary arteries, and the degree of tissue hypoxia was monitored by measuring changes of pyridine nucleotide reduction state by surface fluorescence techniques. The effects of acidosis uncomplicated by possible hypoxia were compared directly with those produced by ischemic hypoxia. The effects of acidosis under these conditions were similar to those described above, and to those produced by ischemia. From these and other data it is concluded that the effects of ischemia are caused by a lowering of the intracellular pH, which decreases the rate of energy production relative to the rate of energy demand. However, it is suggested that the primary cause of the decreased peak systolic pressure with either acidosis or ischemia is not a result of a defect of energy metabolism, but is due to alteration of the calcium cycle of the heart. Possible causes of irreversible heart failure after prolonged ischemia are discussed.\n",
      "Polarographic method for rapid microdetermination of cholesterol with cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase. Cholesterol concentrations in serum are enzymatically determined rapidly by use of a polarographic oxygen analyzer with a circuit modified to record simultaneously the amount and rate of oxygen consumption. The final assay system, assessed from the oxygen consumption value that we found to be optimum, consists of 1 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (0.6 mol/liter, pH 7.0) containing NaN3 (10 mg/liter), Triton X-100 surfactant (10 ml/liter), 0.4 U of cholesterol ester hydrolase, and 0.6 U of cholesterol oxidase. Oxygen consumption and cholesterol concentration are linearly related to 8.0 g/liter, and only 10 mul of serum is required. Replicate analyses of pooled serum by the present method demonstrated the following inter-run precision: mean = 1731 mg/liter, SD = 22.3 mg/liter, CV = 1.3%. Bilirubin and ascorbic acid were without effect on the present method, unlike the enzymatic colorimetric methods.\n",
      "Measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in serum. We describe a method for measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in serum. Extraction with dichloromethane/methanol (2/1 by vol), followed by chromatography on a column of Sephadex LH-20, resulted in an overall analytical recovery of 82% +/- 3.5% (SD). Diluted normal rat serum was used as binding protein because it contains a transport protein that has both a high affinity (Ka = 2 X 10(10) liter/mol) and a high capacity (3 X 10(-6) mol/liter) for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. There is no advantage in using more complex binding proteins derived either from rachitic animals or from cytosol preparations. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (13.4 +/- 4 mug/liter) in the serum of apparently normal Belgian subjects are lower than those reported for North Americans, but resemble those reported for the United Kingdom.\n",
      "Gamma-glutamyltransferase: Substrate inhibition, kinetic mechanism, and assay conditions. Gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in serum is shown to be competitively inhibited by the two substrates gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroanilide and glycylglycine. Awareness of this is of importance when one is choosing final reaction conditions for the assay of the enzyme. Gamma-glutamyltransferase probably acts by a \"ping-pong bi-bi\" kinetic mechanism, which fits with the double competitive substrate inhibition demonstrated. The product, 4-nitro-aniline, appears to be an uncompetitive dead-end inhibitor of both substrates. Various amino acids, particularly glycine and L-alanine, inhibit the enzyme. Their inhibition patterns are uncompetitive with glycylglycine and competitive with gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroanilide. On the basis of the present and other studies, the Scandinavian Society for Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Physiology is going to recommend for routine use a gamma-glutamyltransferase method in which the final concentrations of gamma-glutamyl-4-nitroanilide and glycylglycine are 4 and 75 mmol/liter, respectively.\n",
      "New techniques for ion-selective measurements of ionized calcium in serum after pH adjustment of aerobically handled sera. I report further experience in measuring ionized calcium (Ca2+) with the AMT Electron System and its serum standards and solid-state, dip, calcium-selective electrodes. With this system, serum pH can be adjusted with CO2 gas and Ca2+ and pH simultaneously measured; when 5.2% CO2 (40 mm pco2) is used for sample equilibration, the standard bicarbonate concentration is also provided. I measured serum Ca2+ as a function of pH between pH 7.0 and 9.0 and found the relationship to be reproducible, with no evidence of irreversible complexing of Ca2+. When the pH of aerobically exposed, mailed sera was restored to the original values, their values for Ca2+ were the same as for the fresh sera. Measurement of Ca2+ in routinely (aerobically) handled sera after pH restoration with CO2 gas was therefore validated, both samples from within an institution and mailed specimens. Standardization to pH 7.40 is recommended for routine measurements, is generally more accurate than use of heparin or quasianaerobic techniques, and is a practical approach. In patients with possible uncompensated acid-base disturbance (which may be indicated by an abnormal standard bicarbonate concentration if not suspected clinically), patient pH should be measured independently as part of the usual strict, anaerobic blood-gas-analysis procedures. Abnormal patient pH must be considered in the interpretation of Ca2+ results determined at pH 7.40 which are borderline or slightly abnormal; most accurately, Ca2+ may be measured in the separated sera at the previously determined patient pH value. Studies of aqueous solutions with the currently used Ca2+ electrodes showed a selectivity coefficient (the constant which relates the activity of an interfering ion to the activity of calcium that would contribute the same emf) KNa=0.0031 +/- 0.0003 (SE) and KMg=0.046 +/- 0.004 (SE). At physiological concentrations of Ca2+, physiologically encountered variation in Na+ is of no significance in resulting Ca2+, but extreme variation in Mg2+ may cause an error of approximately 1%.\n",
      "Effect of tobramycin on urinary gamma-glutamyltransferase activity: Studies in a case of renal carcinoma. Gamma-Glutamyltransferase activity was studied in a man presenting with recurrent septicemia owing to pyonephrosis and renal carcinoma. Increased activity in the urine was ascribable to administration of the aminoglycoside antibiotic, tobramycin. That the renal carcinoma did not contribute to the increased values was confirmed by homogenization and enzyme histochemistry of the tumor. Although the activity of this enzyme in serum was greater than normal, this persisted postoperatively, and thus was not related to the renal carcinoma.\n",

Fractionations of serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT) and determinations of the \"abnormal serum lipoprotein X\" (LP-X) have been carried out in sera from patients with different hepatobiliary disorders. LP-X was used to demonstrate or exclude cholestasis. One gamma-GT fraction, alpha2-beta, may be of interest to distinguish between extrahepatic obstruction and intrahepatic cholestasis as was revealed by statistical analysis.\n",
      "Multiple changes in distal stop-flow electrolyte patterns and reduction of acid excretion induced in rabbits by angiotensin. 1. Angiotensin has previously been shown to inhibit distal renal tubular sodium reabsorption. As a consequence of this, or independently, it might influence the distal handling of other electrolytes. We have therefore examined the effects of angiotensin on the distal reabsorption or secretion of a spectrum of electrolytes. 2. Standard bilateral stop-flow studies were done on anaesthetized, adrenalectomized rabbits, in which the effects of intravenous infusions of either 0-02-0-05 mug min-1 kg-1 or 1 mug min-1 kg-1 of angiotensin were compared with control stop-flow results. 3. The lower dose of angiotensin inhibited distal sodium, chloride, water and magnesium reabsorption, inhibited distal hydrogen secretion and stimulated distal potassium secretion. The higher dose of angiotensin produced these changes and additionally inhibited distal calcium reabsorption. Most of the observed changes were dose-related. The low dose of angiotensin did not significantly raise blood pressure but the high dose was pressor. 4. Changes in the stop-flow patterns induced by the higher dose of angiotensin were compatible with, and may help to explain, the changes it produced in urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium and calcium in clearance studies before stop-flow. Suppression of hydrogen secretion caused by both doses of angiotensin in the stop-flow studies was also reflected by reductions in acid excretion produced by these infusion rates in additional experiments performed by clearance methods in acid-loaded, conscious rabbits. 5. The results support the view that angiotensin may have an important intrarenal role, at least in rabbits.\n",
      "The acute effects of respiratory and metabolic acidosis on renal function in the dog. 1. Effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate and cardiac output were measured in osmotically loaded dogs before and during comparable acute respiratory and metabolic acidosis. 2. Urine output increased in control dogs and in animals with metabolic acidosis, but declined with respiratory acidosis. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate declined with respiratory and metabolic acidosis. 3. When respiratory acidosis was buffered with sodium bicarbonate, urine volume increased and glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were unchanged; with trihydroxymethylaminomethane, urine volume increased but glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow fell. 4. When metabolic acidosis was buffered with sodium bicarbonate, urine volume increased; with trihydroxymethylaminomethane, urine volume increased but glomerular filtration rate fell. Cardiac output declined only during metabolic acidosis, both buffered and unbuffered. 5. These studies demonstrate that, even with osmotic loading: (1) respiratory acidosis caused a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow and urine volume; (2) metabolic acidosis depresses glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow but does not change urine volume even though cardiac output falls; (3) sodium bicarbonate is mor effective than trihydroxymethylaminomethane in preserving renal function during respiratory and metabolic acidosis.\n",
      "The haemodynamic effects of metabolic acidosis in the rat. 1. The effect of metabolic acidosis of 4-6 h duration on cardiac output, blood pressure, heart rate, and hepatic and renal blood flow has been studied in the rat. 2. In anaesthetized rats, blood pressure and heart rate fell linearly with blood pH in both sham-operated and nephrectomized rats. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the effect of acidosis on either variable. 3. Cardiac output showed a significant fall with increasing acidosis in the conscious rat. 4. Estimated hepatic blood flow in conscious rats showed a significant positive correlation with blood pH in both sham-operated and nephrectomized animals. There was no significant difference in estimated hepatic blood flow between the two groups of animals at any blood pH. 5. In conscious rats, increasing acidosis caused a progressive decrease in estimated renal blood flow. 6. It is concluded that the increase in the previously described apparent renal contribution to lactate removal in the acidotic rat cannot be explained by any circulatory effect mediated by the kidney. The possible relevance of the findings to lactate homeostasis is discussed.\n",
      "The effect of acidosis on lactate removal by the perfused rat kidney. 1. The isolated perfused kidneys of fed rats in normal acid-base status showed a constant rate of lactate removal from the perfusate between 5 and 90 min of perfusion at a perfusate pH of 7-4-7-5. 2. Lactate removal by kidneys of rats in normal acid-base status was stimulated within 30 min by a reduction in perfusate pH to 7-1-7-2, but depressed when perfusate pH was reduced further. 3. Kidneys taken from rats previously made acidotic and perfused with media of various pH values showed a progressive fall in the rate of lactate removal during the perfusion. 4. Glucose output by the kidneys of rats in normal acid-base status perfused with lactate as substrate was not affected by an alteration in perfusate pH. The kidneys of acidotic rats generally showed an increased rate of glucose output compared with those of control rats.\n",
      "Elastin--proteoglycan interaction. Conformational changes of alpha-elastin induced by the interaction. The interaction between alpha-elastin and a connective tissue proteoglycan was followed by optical density measurements and circular dichroism spectroscopy. It was found that interaction takes place at pH values below the isoelectric point of elastin with the formation of a complex coacervate. CD spectra demonstrated conformational changes of alpha-elastin caused by the interaction and resulting in an increase in the content of helical structure. This finding suggests the possibility of the involvement of proteoglycans in the molecular organization of elastin.\n",

      "Treatment of tardive dyskinesia. The pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia is distinct from and may be functionally opposite to that of parkinsonism. The former is thought to be related to central nervous system dopaminergic hyperactivity, while the latter is known to be related to dopamine deficiency. An effective schema for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia includes avoiding antiparkinsonian medication and prescribing deanol, an acetylcholine precursor, while continuing or increasing phenothiazine dosages.\n",
      "Epidemiology of tardive dyskinesia Part I. We have performed an epidemiological study concerning tardive dyskinesia on a sample of 332 chronic schizophrenic patients (142 males and 190 females, mean age 48.6 years, mean duration of neuroleptic treatment 14.5 years). We could conclude that the age of patients at the time of assessment procedures is the most important variable. The prevalence of tardive dyskinesia was significantly higher in the older population. The significance of an insidious beginning of the illness might be only secondary to the highly significant role of the age. Other factors, such as sex, type of schizophrenia, initial syndrome, present psychic state, organic syndromes and neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndrome, do not seen to play a role in the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia.\n",
      "Postnatal development of the circadian rhythm of rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase activity. The rhythm of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity in 2-day old rats is characterized by a maximum at the beginning and a further one at the end of light-time. In 7-day old animals, the rhythm is much less pronounced than in 2-day old pups. At the 21st day of life, the rats already exhibit the rhythmic pattern of the adults, although the absolute values are still somewhat below those of the adults. The TAT rhythm in neonates is obviously generated by periodic variations in cyclic AMP-dependent release of TAT from polysomes.\n",
      "The influence of dehydrocholate on hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of 3H-taurocholate and 3H-ouabain. The hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of 3H-taurocholate and 3H-ouabain was studied in the rat during saline (control) and dehydrocholate infusions. Dehydrocholate (140 mumol/hr) did not influence the plasma disappearance nor the biliary excretion of taurocholate after a single iv injection (37 mumol/kg). Bile production in the dehydrocholate experiment was increased 2- to 3-fold compared with controls. The biliary transport maximum for exogenously administered taurocholate was determined by constant infusion to be 135.0 +/- 3.0 mumol/hr (22 mumol/min/g of liver). Concomitant infusions of 140 mumol of dehydrocholate per hr did not alter the maximal taurocholate output. The effects of the two bile salts on bile flow were additive. Dehydrocholate (140 mumol/hr) reduced the biliary excretion of 3H-ouabain (0.8 mumol/kg) and elevated the secondary slow component of the plasma disappearance of the cardiac glycoside. The hepatic levels of ouabain were increased compared with controls. It is concluded that dehydrocholate interferes with ouabain transport at the canalicular level but not with primary hepatic uptake. Taurocholate (140 mumol/hr) failed to influence the total biliary output of ouabain. These differences and the lack of interaction between dehydrocholate and taurocholate suggest a hepatic transporting pathway for taurocholate which differs from that for taurocholate which differs from that for dehydrocholate and/or its metabolites.\n",
      "Postnatal development of mixed-function oxidation as measured in microsomes from the small intestine and liver of rabbits. The postnatal development of aminopyrine N-demethylase, aniline 4-hydroxylase, benzpyrene hydroxylase, biphenyl 4-hydroxylase, 7-ethoxycoumarin 0-deethylase activities, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome P-450 was compared in microsomes from the liver and small intestine of New Zealand white rabbits. Apart from hepatic aniline hydroxylase activity, all of the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme activities examined had a similar pattern of development in the liver and small intestine. In both tissues the ability to metabolize xenobiotics was generally undetectable at 2 days of age and remained relatively low for the first 20 days of life. Theresfter, a rapid 2- to 5-fold increase in all the enzyme activity studied was noted, and adult values were reached or exceeded by 30 days of age. Subsequent development of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme activities in the small intestine, but not in the liver, exhibited a transient fall at 50 days of age before adult activities were attained after 75 days of age. The developmental pattern of cytochrome P-450 in the small intestine closely resembled that of the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme activities, but in the liver this correlation was less exact.\n",

      "Monooxygenase-catalyzed aldrin epoxidation and dihydroisodrin hydroxylation in monkey liver needle-biopsy specimens. Assay and properties. Aldrin epoxidation and dihydroisodrin (1,8,9,10,11,11-hexachloro-2,3-7,6-endo-2,1-7,8-endo-tetracyclo [6.2.1.1(3), (6).0(2), (7)]dodec-9-ene (DHI) hydroxylation have been studied in 0.2-ml liver monooxygenase preparations. Liver biopsy specimens of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and bonnet (M. radiata) monkeys obtained with a 1.9-mm Menghini needle were the primary enzyme sources. Dieldrin and monohydroxydihydroisodrin (DHI-OH) were the only metabolites detected by electron-capture GLC analysis of hexane extracts of incubation media. Incubation, extraction, and analysis could be done in the same vessel. Maximum rates were obtained in the presence of NADPH and O2, and both transformations were inhibited by CO. The apparent KM and Vmax (+/-SD) for epoxidation was 1.2 +/- 0.2 X 10(-5) M aldrin and 210 +/- 20 pmol of dieldrin per mg of protein per min, and the corresponding values for hydroxylation were 2.3 +/- 0.4 X 10(-5) M DHI and 150 +/- 20 pmol of DHI-OH per mg of protein per min. Aldrin epoxidation and DHI hydroxylation activities of rhesus monkey liver biopsy and rat liver preparations were evaluated after phenobarbital treatment. The assay procedures can be used in protocols in which animals serve as their own controls.\n",

Further in vitro metabolism of this oxime with the 12,000g supernatant fraction from homogenized rat liver gave one major and two minor metabolites which were identified as 2-nitro-1-phenylpropane, benzyl alcohol, and 1-phenyl-2-propanone, respectively, by means of combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and by comparison with authentic samples of each product.\n",
      "Anaerobic release of fluoride from halothane. Relationship to the binding of halothane metabolites to hepatic cellular constituents. Halothane has been found to undergo a reductive defluorination. This reaction requires an active cytochrome P-450 system and NADPH, and is inducible by phenobarbital and polychlorinated biphenyls but not by methylcholanthrene. The fluoride release occurs only under low O2 tension, while high O2 tension results in the oxidation of halothane to trifluoroacetic acid, inorganic bromide, and chloride. The release of the inorganic fluoride is linear up to 60 min. Because the conditions required for fluoride release and the binding of a halothane metabolite to microsomal phospholipids are similar, the defluorinated halothane molecule is assumed to be involved with this binding. However, based on the amount of fluoride released, the defluorinated halothane metabolite represents only approximately 60% of the total amount of halothane metabolite bound, which suggests that more than one metabolite may be involved in the binding.\n",
      "Microsomal spectral properties and narcotic N-demethylase activity in methadone-dependent rats. Rats were given access ad lib. to various concentrations (0.3 to 1.0 mg/ml) of methadone hydrochloride dissolved in sucrose solution. The N-demethylation of various narcotics was studied in hepatic preparations from methadone-consuming rats in order to determine if there was substrate specificity for the microsomal demethylase system. The Vmax for the N-demethylation of methadone, ethylmorphine, and meperidine was increased by 40-65%, whereas that for morphine N-demethylation was reduced to 55% of the control value. Additive or synergistic effects on microsomal cytochrome P-450 content were seen when methadone consumption was supplemented by administration of maximally inducing doses of either 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or phenobarbital (PB). This suggested that there was an increase in a type of cytochrome P-450 which was independent of that induced by PB or 3-MC. The qualitative change in cytochrome P-450 reflected in the ethylisocyanide binding spectrum was also apparent after treatment with methadone, PB, or 3-MC, and the combination of methadone and PB exhibited effects that differed from PB alone. Two-substrate kinetic analysis with methadone and morphine as substrates indicated that more than one enzymic system may be involved in the N-demethylation reaction and that a common component of this N-demethylase system could not be induced with phenobarbital. However, methadone and meperidine seem to be demethylated by the same enzymic system.\n",
      "Metabolism of 2-(3-chloro-4(4-chlorobenzoyl)-phenyl)-as-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione by the chicken. The metabolism of the anticoccidial 2-[3-chloro-4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)phenyl]-as-triazine-3,-5(2H,4H)-dione (CP-25,415) was investigated in the chicken. It was shown that the predominant residue present in the chicken was 2-[3-chloro-4-(alpha-hydroxy-4-chlorobenzoyl)phenyl]-as-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione (CP-25,641). A gas-liquid chromatographic assay for the analysis of CP-25,641 in biological fluids and tissues was developed which was rapid, accurate, and reproducible. Results of the analytical method correlated well with radiochemical measurements and were indicative of the total drug-related residues. The half-life of CP-25,641 in tissues was approximately 32 hr except in the kidney, where the half-life was approximately 40 hr due to urine retention by the kidneys. CP-25,641 was excreted without further change.\n",
      "Physiological disposition and metabolism of N-t-butylarterenol and its di-p-toluate ester (bitolterol) in the rat. The metabolism and disposition of the bronchodilator, N-t-butylarterenol (tBA) and its di-p-toluate ester (bitolterol) were compared in the rat. Radioactivity was preferentially retained in lungs of rats compared with heart and blood after iv medication with tritium-labeled bitolterol, but was not retained in tissues after iv medication with [3H]tBA. After oral and iv medication with [3H]bitolterol, fecal radioactivity accounted for 24% of the dose and 65 and 79% of the radioactivity, respectively, was excreted in urine (0-72 hr). In comparison, urine radioactivity after oral and iv medication with [3H]tBA was 43 and 83% of the dose, respectively, and fecal radioactivity accounted for 43 or 23% of the dose, respectively (0-72 hr). Bitolterol was hydrolyzed in vitro to tBA by esterases found in various tissues including small intestine, liver, and plasma. Moreover, tBA was a substrate for catecholamine O-methyltransferase but not for monoamine oxidase. Similar metabolites were observed in urine samples of rats given either [3H]tBA or [3H]bitolterol. Urine metabolites were identified as free and conjugated forms of both tBA and 3-O-methyl-tBA.\n",
      "Physiological disposition and metabolism of (3H)bitolterol in man and dog. The metabolism and disposition of bitolterol, the di-p-toluate ester of N-t-butylarterenol (tBA) was studied in man after a single oral dose and in dog after intraduodenal, iv, or oral administration. The mean (+/- SE) peak plasma radioactivity in man (dose, 70 mug/kg) was 180 +/- 18 ng equivalents of [3H]bitolterol per ml or approximately 11% of the dose, whereas peak plasma radioactivity in dog (dose, 200 mug/kg) was 144 +/- 23 ng equivalents per ml or approximately 4% of the dose. For both man and dog, the time for maximum plasma level of radioactivity varied from 0.5 to 2 hr. In man, only 1% of the plasma radioactivity represented intact [3H]bitolterol 1.0 hr after medication. In the dog, radioactivity was concentrated in lung tissue after iv administration of [3H]bitolterol. Recovery of intact [3H]bitolterol in lung at 4.5 hr ranged from 26 to 46% of total tissue radioactivity after iv dosage and from 4 to 14% total tissue radioactivity after intraduodenal administration. Radioactivity recovered in human urine and feces (0-72 hr) accounted for 86 and 8.1% of the dose, respectively. Recovery of radioactivity in dog urine and feces accounted for 58 and 23% of the dose, respectively, in the same time period. Radiochromatograms of urine samples from man and dog revealed similar patterns of metabolites including free and conjugated forms of both tBA and the 3-O-methyl metabolite, N-t-butylmetarterenol. The major radioactive components of the feces were bitolterol and tBA. The results indicate that bitolterol is absorbed orally and retained as the intact ester in lung. The prolonged bronchodilator activity of bitolterol is due to the slow release of the ester from lung and hydrolysis to tBA, an active beta2-adrenoceptor agonist. Pharmacological activity is terminated by metabolism of tBA via conjugation or 3-O-methylation.\n",
      "Adriamycin metabolism in man. Evidence from urinary metabolites. We studied the human metabolism of adriamycin by isolating and identifying urinary metabolites which retain adriamycin's specific fluorescence properties. Metabolites were extracted by adsorption to polystyrene polymeric sorbants, separated on silicic acid columns and purified by thin-layer chromatography. Structures were determined by comparative chromatography; infrared, fluorescence, and mass spectroscopy; and enzymatic and chemical degradation. Substances identified were adriamycinol, adriamycinol aglycone, adriamycin aglycone, deoxyadriamycin aglycone, deoxyadriamycinol aglycone, demethyldeoxyadriamycinol aglycone, demethyldeoxyadriamycinol aglycone 4-O-sulfate, and demethyldeoxyadriamycinol aglycone 4-O-beta-glucuronide. Other metabolites have been purified but not identified. Human metabolism of adriamycin involved carbonyl reduction, reductive glycosidic cleavage, hydrolytic glycosidic cleavage, O-demethylation, O-sulfation, and O-beta-glucuronidation. Carbonyl reduction was the major enzymatic conversion occurring in the human.\n",
      "[Termination of pregnancy and perinatal mortality (author's transl)]. Elective induction was practised in 1875 of 10 537 deliveries (17.8%). Duration of delivery was, if anything, shortened after elective induction, compared with spontaneous delivery. There was no evidence of soft-tissue dystocias after elective induction. The Apgar score was 8-10 in 95.7% of children born after elective induction. pH of umbilical-artery blood in 95.7% of children after elective induction was greater than or equal to 7.2. There was a striking increase in the incidence of occiput posterior position with elective induction (2.7% of cases). The incidence of operative vaginal delivery was as frequent after elective as after all other forms of delivery. The incidence of section was 4.7% after elective induction, 11.5% in the entire series, intra-uterine asphyxia being an indication in 1.7%, compared with 2.5% for the total group. The frequency of operations was inversely proportional to the cervical index. Perinatal mortality was 0.53 per thousand (one case) after elective induction, 10.15 per thousand in the total group, 5.9 per thousand in those with indication for early induction. Perinatal mortality decreased from 23.0 per thousand to 7.2 per thousand from 1967 to 1974.\n",
      "Binding of organic compounds to rat liver and lung. The binding of various radioisotopically labeled organic compounds to rat liver and lung was investigated in vitro. Pieces of rat lung and slices of rat liver were incubated at 37 degrees C under a nitrogen atmosphere in a modified Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution (pH 7.4) CONTAININg the compound to be studied. Of the neutral compounds investigated, digitoxin, digoxin and dexamethasone were highly bound to both liver and lung tissue, whereas the degree of binding of amitrole, erythritol, and ouabain was 20% or less. The weak acids which were bound to the greatest extent in both liver and lung were phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and diphenylhydantoin. Barbital was poorly bound, and there was no evidence for the binding of 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione or p-aminohippuric acid in either tissue. Binding of the cardiac glycosides and the barbiturates directly paralleled their lipid solubilities. The degree of binding of neutral compounds and weak acids to lung and liver tissue did not vary greatly with concentration, even though broad concentration ranges were studied. This was also true of the weak base morphine. On the other hand, the binding to liver and lung of the organic bases nicotine, pilocarpine, d-amphetamine, lidocaine, erythromycin, and chloroquine, did vary with concentration. The quaternary ammonium compound decamethonium was bound only to liver, and this binding also varied with concentration. Two additional quaternary ammonium compounds, tetraethylammonium and N1-methylnicotinamide, were not significantly bound to either tissue. Comparisons on the basis of equal content of solids revealed that the binding of diverse organic compounds in liver is greater than or equal to that in lung.\n",
      "Pharmacokinetics of digoxin in the rat. Previous studies on the pharmacokinetics of 3H-digoxin in the rat have been based on total radioactivity in the plasma, even though the drug is extensively metabolized in this species. A comparison of total radioactivity vs. unchanged drug in rat plasma after administration of 3H-digoxin clearly showed the need to separate digoxin from its metabolites. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin were therefore examined using solvent extraction and thin-layer chromatography to isolate unchanged drug. Digoxin levels after a 1 mg/kg iv dose were measured in the plasma and urine of adult male rats in which the bile duct or the ureters had been ligated, as well as in sham-operated controls. In all cases, digoxin concentrations were best described by a two-compartment open model. Digoxin was rapidly eliminated from the plasma of controls, with a half-life of 2.5 hr, a volume of distribution of 3.6 liter/kg, and a renal clearance somewhat lower than the glomerular filtration rate. No significant change in these parameters was observed in rats with bile duct ligation. The total body clearance of 5.77 ml/min in the controls was reduced by only 10% in the bile duct-ligated rats. In animals with bilateral ureter ligation, the body clearance was reduced by 30% and the plasma half-life of digoxin was increased to 4 hr, although no significant change in the apparent volume of distribution was noted. Approximately 60% of the total body clearance was unaffected by bile duct and ureter ligations, and was assumed to be due to biotransformation. Biliary excretion was found to be important for digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside, inasmuch as rats with bile duct ligation showed elevated metabolite levels in the plasma as well as a 3-fold increase in renal excretion of the bisglycoside.\n",
      "N-acetylation of drugs. Pharmacogenetic studies in rabbits selected for their acetylator characteristics. Studies on acetylation of sulfadiazine, isoniazid, and p-aminobenzoic acid in selected lines of slow and rapid acetylator rabbits are described. Pedigree analysis of rabbits classified as slow or rapid sulfadiazine acetylators confirmed previous studies that the rate of sulfadiazine elimination (acetylation) is genetically controlled, with rapid elimination dominant over slow elimination of the drug. Pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits of specified sulfadiazine acetylator genotypes with isoniazid and p-aminobenzoic acid show that the rate of isoniazid elimination is under the same genetic control as is sulfadiazine, whereas the rate of p-aminobenzoic acid elimination is not. A new drug acetylation polymorphism, which controls the rate of enzymatic acetylation of p-aminobenzoic acid in peripheral blood cells and which is related to the sulfadiazine acetylation polymorphism, is described.\n",
      "Histidyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium. Interaction with substrates and ATP analogues. Structural requirements for substrate binding to histidyl-tRNA synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium have been investigated using ATP analogues. Ki values and the relative binding affinity of the enzyme for these analogues have been determined in the tRNA aminoacylation reaction. The enzyme is highly specific for ATP: no binding was found for GTP, CTP, TTP and UTP. dATP is a very poor substrate for acylation of tRNA, with a Km 40-fold higher than that of ATP. Binding of adenosine 5'-triphosphate requires interactions of the amino group of adenosine and the sugar moiety; the 2' and the 5' positions of the ribose appear to be essential for recognition; the phosphate groups enhance the binding. AMP is a noncompetitive inhibitor with ATP. The interaction of histidyl-tRNA synthetase, a dimeric enzyme, with histidine and ATP was examined by fluorescence measurements at equilibrium and by equilibrium dialysis. Binding with L-histidine is significantly tighter at pH 6 than at pH 7, while the ATP binding is independent of pH. The stoichiometry was measured at pH 6 than at pH 7, while the ATP binding is independent of pH. The stoichiometry was measured at pH 7.5 by equilibrium dialysis and is 1 mol ATP/mol enzyme and, variably, close to 2 or 1 mol histidine/mol enzyme.\n",
      "[The coupling of beta1-24-corticotropin to the adenylate-cylase system in rat adipocytes. Evidence for hormone-nucleotides interaction (author's transl)]. The general aim was to define some of the most important parameters involved in the coupling step between the synthetic analog of adrenocoricotropin hormone  (beta1-24-corticotropin tetracosa peptide) and the catalytic unit of the adenylate-cyclase system of fat cells.  These studies were performed with a purified plasma membrane fraction from rat adipose tissue.  In this regard, some effects of ions, pH, and nucleotides (ATP nad GTP) on this hormone sensitive system were studied A simple model based on a random association process of reactants yeilded a statisfactory approximation of the kinetic data.  In contract to results obtained by two other groups, which were analyzed by De Haen, no evidence was found for a regulation of the adenylate-cyclase activity by the adenosine triphosphate which was not complexed to magnesium...\n",
      "Ion-binding to phospholipids. Interaction of calcium with phosphatidylserine. The binding of Ca2+ to monolayers and bilayers of phosphatidylserine has been investigated as a function of pH, ionic strength (NaCl concentration) and Ca2+ concentration using surface and colloid chemical techniques. The molar ratio of lipid to bound calcium decreases to 2 as the Ca2+ concentration is increased to about 0.1 mM. At [Ca2+] greater than 0.1 mM a 1:1 complex is formed. The apparent binding constant Ka ranges from about approximately 10(6) - 10(4) l/mol depending on the Ca2+ concentration. After allowing for electrostatic effects and neighbour group interactions, the intrinsic binding constant Ki of the phosphorylserine polar group at pH 7 (I = 0.01 M), where it carries a net negative charge of one, is approximately 10(4) l/mol; consistent values for Ki were obtained using several independent approaches. Ka for Ca2+ binding decreases with increasing NaCl concentration because the monovalent cations compete with Ca2+ for the same binding site. Na+ and K+ are equally effective in displacing 45Ca2+ adsorbed to monolayers of phosphatidylserine, both with respect to the kinetics and the equilibrium of the displacement. Ka for the reaction between phosphatidylserine and monovalent cations is about 10(3)-fold smaller than that of Ca2+. An investigation of the binding of Mn2+ to phosphatidylserine by both surface chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance methods shows that this cation has a similar binding constant to that of Ca2+. The Ca2+-binding capabilities of monolayers containing only carboxyl groups (i.e. arachidic acid) and phosphodiester groups (i.e. dicetyl phosphate) have also been determined; the apparent pK for the - COOH group in monolayers is larger than or equal to 9 and that for the phosphodiester group is less than 4. Since these groups do not retain the same pK values when they are in close proximity in the phosphorylserine group, the relative contributions of the two groups to the binding of Ca2+ to phosphatidylserine is not obvious.\n",
      "Action of H1 and H2 inhibitors on the response of histamine sensitive adenyly cyclase from guinea-pig mucosa. In the guinea-pig, it has been shown that homogenates of mucosa from the fundus contain an adenylyl cyclase system that is activated by histamine as well as by prostaglandins PGE1 and PGA1. The effects of burimamide, an H2-inhibitor, and mepyramine and chlorpheniramide, both H1-inhibitors, were tested. Both H1 and H2 inhibitors behaved kinetically as competitive inhibitors of histamine, but the Km derived for burimamide (2.5 - 4.1 . 10(-5)) was significantly lower than that for either chlorpheniramine (0.9 - 1.9 . 10(-4)) or mepyramine (1.3 - 1.4 . 10(-4)). On the other hand none of the three inhibitors influenced the cyclase activation by PGE1 and PGA1. These results suggest that there are at least two types of receptors in the preparation studied, one responsive to histamine and the other to the prostaglandins, and that the specificity of H1- and H2-receptors is not absolute in the broken cell preparation.\n",
      "Anti-arrhythmic action of nadolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. The anti-arrhythmic action of 2,3-cis-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5-[(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butylamino)propoxy]2,3-naphthalenediol (nadolol) was evaluated and compared with that of propranolol in several experimental models of cardiac arrhythmias. Both nadolol and propranolol antagonized isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and ouabain-induced arrhythmias in cats, antagonized coronary artery ligation-induced ventricular fibrillation and suppressed ventricular ectopic activity during vagal stimulation in dogs. In contrast to propranolol, nadolol was considerably weaker in suppressing existing digoxin-induced arrhythmias, lacked local anesthetic activity and did not depress the heart in dogs. Because of these findings, it is concluded that the anti-arrhythmic activity of nadolol is apparently related to blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors.\n",
      "Effects of chemical stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system upon locomotor activity. The effects of local injections of drugs into terminal areas of the mesolimbic dopamine system were investigated. Bilateral administration of dopamine, but not of noradrenaline and serotonin, into the nucleus accumbens of non-pretreated rats resulted in stimulation of locomotor activity. No clear or only minor effects were seen after injections of the dopamine metabolites 3-methoxytyramine, DOPAC and HVA and after injections of media with different pH and osmolality. d-Amphetamine proved more effective than dopamine in producing locomotor stimulation, whereas both stimulant and depressant effects were observed following injection of apomorphine into the nucleus accumbens. ET 495 and the noradrenaline agonists clonidine, phenylephrine and isoprenaline did not enhance locomotor activity, but theophylline was effective. Pretreatment with haloperidol, but not with clozapine, significantly reduced the effects of dopamine and theophylline. Locomotor stimulation was also found following bilateral administration of dopamine, d-amphetamine and apomorphine into the tuberculum olfactorium, whereas noradrenaline, serotonin and ET 495 produced no, or rather depressant effects. These results provide further evidence for an important role of the mesolimbic dopamine system with respect to locomotor activity.\n",
      "Effect of PGE1 on lipogenesis in perfused rat liver. In perfused livers of 24 hour-fasted rats, PGE1 (prostaglandin E1) infused continuously into the perfusate, was found to cause a 45% increase in the incorporation of 1-14C acetate into liver fatty acids. PGE1 was found to have no effect, however, on the activity of the key lipogenic enzymes.\n",
      "Influence of mono- and multivalent cations on the electrokinetic properties of normal human lymphoid and burkitt lymphoma cells. Various mono- and multivalent cations, at constant ionic strength, affected the surface electrokinetic properties of normal human lymphoid and Burkitt lymphoma cells in a manner which reflected more the physicochemical properties and binding affinities of the cation than its valence. The effect was expressed in the changes of the magnitude of the net surface charge and in the shift of the isoelectric point of the surface. These changes were greater at the surface of Burkitt's lymphoma cells than at the surface of their normal cell-line counterparts.\n",

The synthesis of a number of 1-alkyl-7-(2-hydroxy-3-alkylaminopropoxy)-1,8-naphthyridin-2-ones is described. The compounds studied were prepared by reaction of 1-alkyl-7-hydroxy-1,8-naphthyridin-2-ones with epichlorohydrin. The substituted epoxy intermediates obtained were allowed to react with amines and gave the desired products. All the compunds prepared were devoid of beta-blocking activity.\n",
      "[Pharmacology of methvin--a new ganglionic blocking preparation of short-term effect]. Methvin (vincanin chlormethylate) is an active ganglion blocking agent of a short-term action. As regards its gangliolytic action it is approximately 6 times superior to afronad. In test animals the drug produces a well-marked and short-term (easily controllable) hypotensive effect, without causing any histamine-like and direct vasodilation action. When used in relatively high doses methvin blocks the neuro-muscular conduction, potentiates the action of major muscle relaxants. A study of methvin in clinical conditions confirmed its high gangliolytic activity previously revealed in experiments.\n",
      "[Heightened anticholinesterase activity of chlorophos in its interaction with the TMB-4 reactivator in vitro]. Experiments in vitro demonstrated that a thermostatic treatment of an aqueous chlorophos solution at 38 degrees is attended by its increased cholinesterase activity. The speed of the process is much higher in an alkaline medium. A joint incubation of chlorophos with the TMB-4 reactivator of pH of 7.5 and 38 degrees not only fails to result in decomposition of the poison, but on the contrary, tends to speed up the progressive accretion of the inhibitory properties of this organophosphorus compound. The author considers the data obtained as one of the proofs pointing to the formation during direct interaction of TMB-4 with chlorophos or the product of its transformation of a stable complex appearing to be a powerful anticholinesterase agent.\n",
      "The temperature, pH, and partial pressure of oxygen in the cervix and uterus of women and uterus of rats during the cycle. Changes in the temperature, pH, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the cervical canal and cavum uteri were measured in women with or without an intrauterine device and in the uteri of rats throughout the cycle. Only the PO2 exhibited significant variations, rising during the ovulatory phase in both cervices of women and uteri in rats. It is speculated that the rise in PO2 is related to the function of these organs as reservoirs for spermatozoa.\n",
      "[Responses of small intestine tissue chemoreceptors to change in the pCO2, pH and (HCO3-) in perfusion solutions]. Perfusion of the small intestine of anesthetized cats with a solution having excessive CO2 and H+ concentration (pCO2 60 mm Hg; pH; 7.2; [HCO3-] 25 MM) produced a threshold reflex increase in the blood pressure. The subsequent increase of pCO2 to 380 mm Hg and decrease of pH to 6.4 evoked a gradual raise of the blood pressure (8.0+/-0.6 mm Hg) followed by the sharp increase of pressor reflexes amplitude within the range of pH 6.4--6.1. Tissue receptors were found to be essentially sensitive to solutions imitating metabolic acidosis (decrease of [HCO3-] within the physiological range of pH changes (pH 7.1--6.8). Solutions with pH 6.4--6.1 imitating respiratory acidosis (increase of pCO2) were more effective than those imitating metabolic acidosis. The possible role of interstitial pH changes in responses of the tissue chemoreceptors to CO2, is discussed.\n",
      "Identification of dimethylnitrosoamine metabolites in vitro. The incubation of dimethylnitrosoamine (DMNA) in the presence of rat liver microsomes leads to production of formaldehyde, formic acid, methylamine, and N-methylhydrazine. When pH 5-enzymes are added to the medium there is also the formation of N-methylhydroxylamide and N,N-dimethylhydrazine. The last compound is the only metabolite produced, to a lesser extent, by the pH 5-enzymes. Thus, the denitrosated or non-denitrosated metabolites are produced either by an oxidative dealkylation and by a reduction of DMNA, catalysed by microsomal and cellular soluble enzymes.\n",
      "Degradation of dimethylnitrosoamine catalysed by physical and chemical agents. Decomposition of dimethylnitrosoamine (DMNA) by chemical and physical agents was further investigated. Both photoirradiation with sunlight or ultraviolet ray and reductive reactions under acid conditions (likely occurring in the stomach) led to the formation of formaldehyde, formic acid, and N-methydrazine, in addition to denitrosated compounds such as methylamine, dimethylamine, and N-methylhydroxylamine. N-Methylhydrazine was the only compound which was not detected by photoirradiation under neutral conditions. The agreement between physiochemical and metabolic degradation products and the possible biological meaning are discussed together with the problem of environmental contamination by the nitroso compound.\n",
      "Properties of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase in microsomes of Morris hepatoma 5123D and the host liver. Properties of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase in the microsomes were compared between Morris hepatoma 5123D and the host liver from rats bearing this tumor. Requirement of NADPH for the assay of the enzyme activity was observed, compared to that of NADH, and also the additive effect of NADH on the requirement of NADPH was found in the tumor and liver. Curve of pH optimum of the enzyme activity in tumor and liver differed between the rats treated with corn oil and those with 3-methylcholanthrene, indicating a slight shift of the peak value to alkaline pH in the latter. The same values of the apparent Km for NADPH and NADH were shown for the enzyme from the liver and tumor even 24 hr after the treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene, but a difference in the apparent Km for benzo[a]pyrene was demonstrated between the tumor and the host liver, showing 3.6 approximately 6.6 muM in the former and 9.1 approximately 20 muM in the latter. By the addition of 7,8- or 5,6-benzoflavone to the assay medium for the tumor, the induced enzyme was inhibited noncompetitively, and the constitutive enzyme was enhanced, as demonstrated in the host liver. As observed in the induced enzyme in both tissues, cyclohexene oxide and 1,1,1-trichloropropane oxide slightly increased the activity of the constitutive enzyme in the tumor, in contrast to its inhibition in the host liver.\n",
      "Electronic interaction of carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic benz(c)acridines and DNA. Electronic interaction of DNA with nine benzacridine derivatives was studied. The interaction system of these benzacridines and DNA was found to show a marked hypochromism in the ultraviolet region. The orderly double helical structure of DNA was found to play an essential role in this spectroscopic change. A high concentration of the interactant, low environmental ionic strength, low pH, and low temperature were beneficial in this interaction. The degree of hypochromism expressed by the integrated and pKa of the benzacridines were found to be in parallel. The hypochromism of the interaction system, in which the carcinogenic benz[c]acridine derivatives took part, was larger than that of the system in which the noncarcinogenic derivatives were involved.\n",

An immunosuppressive factor was purified from Ehrlich carcinoma ascites by the combination of ultrafiltration and Sephadex chromatography. The resulting product showed 50% reduction in the number of splenic plaque-forming cells in mice immunized with sheep red blood cells when as low as 50 mug dose was given twice intraperitoneally before erythrocyte injection. The molecular size of the product was between 30,000 and 100,000, and it was relatively heat unstable.\n",
      "[Inhalation analgesia with methoxyfluran (penthrane) in obstetrics (author's transl)]. In 105 normal spontaneous deliveries the effect of inhalation analgesia with Methoxyfluran (Penthrane) was studied. Penthrane was administered intermittently with the Penthrane oxilator (Rod inhalator of Abbott). The initial concentration was 0.25 volume%. The maximal concentration was 0.35 volume% of Penthrane. Fetal monitoring records were obtained in all deliveries. In 49 cases (46.7%) intra- and post-partum microblood studies were obtained. In 85 women (81.0%) the result of the analgesia was good. Nausea occurred in 21 women (20%). There were no abnormal fetal monitoring patterns. The Apgar scores of the newborns were between 8 and 10. The actual pH's were between 7.24 and 7.41.

The changes in pH and concentration of electrolytes in the jejunal lumen after a hypertonic fluid meal have been studied after truncal vagotomy and drainage, with and without diarrhoea. The results show that, in these respects, there are no specific changes in the jejunal content associated with post-vagotomy diarrhoea, but that these measurements are markedly affected by the completeness of vagotomy, as judged by the insulin test.\n",
      "Vitamin B12 absorption--a study of intraluminal events in control subjects and patients with tropical sprue. The intraluminal fate of orally administered radioactive vitamin B12 has been studied in control subjects with normal vitamin B12 absorption and those with vitamin B12 malabsorption due to tropical sprue. In control subjects 1 to 21% of the dose was bound to sedimentable material and 37 to 75% was bound to immunoreactive intrinsic factor. In subjects with vitamin B12 malabsorption due to tropical sprue, the results were identical with the control subjects. Bacteriological studies showed a statistically significant correlation between both the number of flora in the jejunum and the number of bacteroides in both the jejunum and ileum and vitamin B12 malabsorption. In patients with tropical sprue who have normal intrinsic factor secretion, the vitamin B12 absorptive defect is not due to binding of the vitamin to bacteria or to alteration to the intrinsic factor vitamin B12 complex in the intestinal lumen. The lesion appears to be one of the mucosal cell receptors or of the cells themselves, possibly caused by bacterial toxins.\n",
      "[Experimental testing of a new gastrotherapeutic agent]. A new gastrotherapeutical preparation, AcT 72, has been evaluated. This preparation contains the anticholinergic drug propantheline bromide, the psychotherapeutical agent perazine, and antacids. In two different series of tests it was demonstrated that after a peroral dose of ACT72, gastric motility was significantly reduced when compared with the control situation. Dosages used were in accordance with normal therapeutic doses, and, because of the influence on gastric motility, the duration of action in the stomach was prolonged, thus reducing daily dose requirements. Reduction of stomach motility per se, has therapeutic value in patients with gastric ulcers.\n",
      "[The disulfide bridges of the trypsin-kallikrein inhibitor K from snails (Helix pomatia). Thermal inactivation and proteolysis by thermolysin (author's transl)]. Isoinhibitor K is the main component of the complex mixture of isoinhibitors of broad specificity secreted into the mucus by the Roman snail (Helix pomatia). The disulfide pairing was determined after the amino acid sequence had been elucidated. Two cystine-containing peptides with the disulfide bridges Cys32-Cys53 and Cys32-Cys53 plus Cys7-Cys57 were obtained after thermolytic hydrolysis of the native inhibitor at 80 degrees C and chromatographic separation of the peptides using SE-Sephadex. The Cys16-Cys40 disulfide bridge could be reduced selectively by sodium borohydride with no loss in biological activity. This property and the covalent structure correspond to that of the intracellular inhibitor from bovine organs, which is largely homologous in its amino acid sequence to the secretory inhibitor from the snail. The complete covalent structure of isoinhibitor K will be presented. The snail inhibitor is less stable against proteolytic inactivation by thermolysin and against thermal denaturation at pH 8.0 than the inhibitor from bovine organs (Kunitz inhibitor).\n",
      "[The inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor as precursor of the acid-stable proteinase inhibitors in human serum and urine]. A small amount of antitryptic activity is detectable in the supernatant of deproteinized human serum. Preincubation of serum with trypsin causes an increase in acid-stable antitryptic activity. This rise in activity depends on the inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor concentration. The native inhibitor present in normal sera, and in higher concentrations in sera of patients with nephropathies, and the trypsin-liberated inhibitor show immunological cross reaction with antibodies to the serum inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor. The two inhibitors differ in molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility. The physiological inhibitor (I-34), with a molecular weight of 34 000 and a high carbohydrate content, can be transformed by trypsin into an inhibitor (I-17) with a molecular weight of 17 000. This inhibitor is identical with the inhibitors liberated by trypsin from serum or from purified inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor. The acid-stable inhibitor from urine is identical with the physiological serum inhibitor. Analogously, this inhibitor is transformed by trypsin into the inhibitor with a molecular weight of 17 000. We conclude that the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor is the precursor of both the physiological and the trypsin-liberated inhibitor. By a mechanism as yet unknown, but most likely a limited proteolysis, the secreted inhibitor is liberated from the high molecular weight precursor. In contrast to the monospecific trypsin-inhibiting precursor, the physiological and artificially liberated inhibitors are trypsin/chymotrypsin/plasmin inhibitors.\n",
      "Plant microbody proteins, I. Purification and characterization of catalase from leaves of lens culinaris. 1) Catalase from green leaves of Lens culinaris (lentils) was investigated with respect to isoenzyme patterns. In contrast to other plants, which have been reported to contain multiple forms of catalase, only one form of this enzyme was revealed when crude extracts were subjected to starch gel electrophoresis or to polyacrylamide disc-gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, catalases from leaves, stems and cotyledons were electrophoretically identical. 2) The leaf enzyme has been purified by conventional methods to apparent homogeneity. It has a molecular weight of 225 000 (ultracentrifuge) and is composed of four identical subunits of molecular weight 54 000 (sodium dodecylsulphate gel electrophoresis). The ratio A280/A405 of the pure enzyme was found to be 1.5. The isoelectric point is at pH 5.5. The enzyme, very labile at pH-values below 7.0, is stable in Tris chloride and potassium phosphate buffers between pH 7.5 and 9.5. It is slowly inactivated by 1mM dithiothreitol and is rapidly inactivated by 1mM mercaptoethanol. 3) The catalase was shown to be the major protein component of the peroxisomal matrix. It could not be detected at the membranes of the leaf peroxisomes.\n",
      "The activator of human cerebroside sulphatase. Activating effect on the acidic forms of the sulphatases from invertebrates. 1) Acidic forms of the sulphatase were partially purified from the following invertebrate species: Tethya aurantium (Porifera), Patella vulgata (mollusca), Maja squinado (Arthropoda), Marthasterias glacialis (Echinodermata) and Microcosmus sulcatus (Tunicata). Enzyme preparations thus obtained cleaved cerebroside sulphates (sulphatides) only in the presence of either specific detergents (e.g. taurodeoxycholate) or an activator protein isolated from human liver. This corresponds to the findings on purified sulphatase A of human origin. 2) At low concentrations, the activating effect was proportional to the amount of activator protein applied; at higher concentrations, proportionality was obtained only in some cases. On a molar basis, less of the activator protein was required to achieve the same activation as taurodeoxycholate. At optimum concentrations of the detergent however, the activation was much higher. 3) The enzyme specificity of the activator and some evolutionary implications are discussed.\n",
      "Multiple forms of boar acrosin and their relationship to proenzyme activation. Further evidence is presented that the acrosomal proteinase acrosin exists as a zymogen precursor in freshly ejaculated boar spermatozoa. Autoactivation of proacrosin to acrosin takes place optimally at slightly alkaline pH and in the presence of calcium ions. Activation is considerably accelerated by catalytic amounts of trypsin or highly purified acrosin. A significant acceleration of the activation is also achieved by porcine pancreatic and urinary kallikrein, whereas chymotrypsin, plasmin, thrombin or urokinase showed no effect. Activation can be inhibited by p-amino-benzamidine and p-nitrophenyl p'-guanidino-benzoate. Electrophoretic analysis at different stages of activation revealed that during this process various molecular forms of acrosin are produced, apparently by limited proteolysis.\n",

Disarrangements in microcirculation, oxygen supply, water and electrolyte metabolism and acid-base metabolism are described and the way they will influence nutrition therapy. Furthermore, we try to describe special conditions of metabolism in stress and its influence to efficiency of nutritive therapy.\n",
      "[Clinical testing of bronchospasmolytics in combined alternating test schedules]. NAB 365, a new beta2-adrenergic bronchodilator was tested in oral doses of 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04 mg. An acute trial was carried out in outpatients suffering from chronic obstructive airways disease. Airway resistance was measured by bodyplethysmography. For doses from 0.02 to 0.04 mg NAB 365 a quick, dose related and statistically significant bronchodliation without remarkable side effects could be found. The application of Fenoterol and Sch 1000 (ipratropiumbromide) by a metered dose inhaler was followed by a further and finally equal bronchodilation. To avoid adrenergic side effects the combination of NAB 365 with Sch 1000 should be preferred to the combination of NAB 365 with Fenoterol.\n",
      "The first transplantation of a Fallopian tube of frozen material in woman. There is an ever-present possibility that the children or husband of a sterilized woman may die. In the latter case, and after remarriage, she and her new husband may want children of their own, which presents difficulties, as the low success rate of reconstructive surgery in the sterilised woman is well known. A case history is presented of the first sterilized woman to undergo Fallopian tube transplantation.\n",
      "An objective method for evaluating Angus and Hereford sperm motility. Angus and Hereford sperm motility was evaluated by an objective spectrophotometric procedure and by a conventional subjective ranking system. Semen was collected by electroejaculation and divided so that one group contained 6 Angus samples and one group contained 12 Hereford samples. Objective procedures indicated that Angus sperm was twice motile as Hereford sperm in 2.9% sodium citrate. This objective procedure depends on the orientation of sperm in a flowing liquid and then spectrophotometrically measuring the sperm's ability to return to randomness when the flow is stopped. During preparation for freezing with liquid nitrogen, microscopic subjective ranking of sperm motility was carried out. Three conditions were studied subjectively: (I) arrival at the laboratory, (II) pre-freeze, and (III) thawed samples. No significant differences in subjective evaluation of sperm motility was found between conditions or breeds. Preliminary results indicate that this objective procedure can distinguish between the sperm motility in 2.9% sodium citrate from two breeds of cattle. Use of this objective procedure for studies relating to fertilization and artificial insemination is evident and there is no theoretical reason why the procedure can not be used with other species.\n",
      "Sperm antibodies in men from infertile couples. Analysis of sperm agglutinins and immunofluorescent antibodies in 657 men. Sera from 657 men from infertile couples were tested for sperm agglutinins and spermatozoal antibodies detectable by the indirect immunofluorescense technique (IFT), and the results were correlated to the clinical examinations of the couples. Sperm agglutinins were found in 6.7%. Spontaneous agglutination of the ejaculated spermatozoa was observed only among these men, most commonly among those with high serum titres. IF-antibodies against the four spermatozoal antigens located beneath the cell membrane occurred in 15.2% of the patients. Antibodies against the front part of the acrosome and the postnuclear cap were mainly IgM. Antibodies against the equatorial segment of the acrosome were predominantly IgG and in a few cases IgA, whereas straining of the main tail piece was caused by IgG antibodies. Considering the clinical fertility status of the couples, sperm agglutinins in high titres (greater than or equal to 10) against the equatorial segment and the main tail piece of the spermatozoa were found significantly more often among men from couples with unexplained infertility than among clinically normal men from couples where the findings in the women could be assumed to cause infertility. These results support the view that sperm agglutinins can cause infertility, whereas the significance of the IF-antibodies is still unclarified as, in some cases, these can be found even in high titres in men with proven fertility. The possible mechanism of autosensitization were evaluated by means of an anamnestic study.\n",
      "The value of the basal temperature chart in the management of infertility. The basal temperature chart (BTC) has been used as a means of screening the ovarian function of infertile patients and for monitoring their response to ovarian stimulation. During three years in a busy infertility clinic, specifically designated for cases of functional infertility, 491 patients were seen and 96 per cent of them kept valid basal temperature charts. The use of the BTC enabled therapy to be instituted early on in the course of investigations in those cases of infertility in which there was an endocrine factor. There were 420 patients in this category; of those who received treatment a high percentage became pregnant in contrast to those who were being observed. It is recommended that the BTC should be used early and more frequently in the management of cases of infertility, since it has been shown to serve as an inexpensive and convenient parameter of ovarian function.\n",
      "Absorption activity of the blood group substances in various fractions of split ejaculates from man. Antigens of the ABO system have been determined in the various fractions of split ejaculates from three A and two O (H) men who were secretors. The activity of the antigen was determined by a hemagglutination inhibition test. Within a split ejaculate the various fractions contained almost the same antigen activity, indicating that the antigens were secreted from all the glands contributing to the seminal plasma.\n",
      "The polycystic ovary. I. Estradiol/testosterone ratio and the use of antiestrogens. Several treatments have been used to induce ovulation in the polycystic ovary. In the following study, estradiol and testosterone plasma concentration were measured and evaluated in 18 women with polycystic ovaries, as one of the factors involved in the antiestrogenic response to Clomiphene Citrate. An estrogen plasma concentration baseline of 50 pg/ml is proposed in order to obtain the antiestrogenic effects. Nevertheless, induction of ovulation was achieved when the estradiol/testosterone ratio was 0.09 or higher (P less than 0.001).\n",
      "The polycystic ovary. II. Progesterone plasma levels after the use of antiestrogens. In the present study, the changes observed in the length of the cycle, basal body temperatures, endometrial histology and plasma progesterone in a group of 18 patients with polycystic ovaries, treated with Clomiphene Citrate, is reported. Two distinctive responses were observed depending on the estradiol/testosterone mean concentration found. Regardless of the induction of ovulation, a clear change in the length of the cycle was observed. Progesterone concentration of 2.1-2.9 ng/ml gave a definite rise in BBT, but no endometrial secretory changes were found in parallel with that concentration. Progesterone concentration above 6.1 ng/ml did induce secretory changes in the endometrium.\n",
      "Offspring of subfertile parents. A preliminary survey. This preliminary survey reports findings among offspring of subfertile parents. Combining neonatal death, low birth weight and major anomalies, 11 of 60 livebirths (18%) were affected, indicating that subfertility adversely influences neonatal morbidity and mortality. Information was available for 49 of 56 children and there were none with developmental delay nor was there an increase in malformations or minor behavioral or learning disorders. Although numbers are small, these observations suggest that children of subfertile parents who survive the neonatal period do not differ from the normal population.\n",
      "Increased fibrinolytic activity in the endometrium of patients using copper-iud (gravigard). The use of an IUD often causes an increase in the menstrual blood loss, and this is the most common reason for removing the device. The fibrinolytic activity of the endometrium was studied histochemically in 15 women before and after the use of copper-IUD for 2-5 as well as for 8-12 months. The fibrinolytic activity in the endometrium was found to be increased at both examinations. This increase is probably a contributory cause of the menorrhagia in patients with IUD. No significant difference in fibrinolytic activity was found between the two examinations after insertion of the IUD, which thus suggests that the increase in endometrial fibrinolytic activity was steady.\n",
      "Effects of aminophylline, imidazole and indomethacin on spontaneous and prostaglandin induced ovarian contractions in vitro. Imidazole, acetylcholine, phenylephrine prostaglandin F2alpha, and methyl prostaglandin F2alpha increased the contractility of guinea pig and human ovaries in vitro. This effect was suppressed by aminophylline. Indomethacin inhibited ovarian contractions. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was reversed by prostaglandin F2alpha or by its methyl derivative. Prostaglandin E2 decreased the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous and prostaglandin F2alpha induced contractions of guinea pig ovaries in vitro. The study shows that compounds which interfere with cyclic AMP and prostaglandin metabolism affect ovarian contractility in vitro.\n",
      "Effect of low doses of alpha-chlorohydrin on fertility and semen characteristics and binding of the drug of spermatozoa in swine. Daily feeding of 1 mg of alpha-chlorohydrin per kg body weight to boars prevented fertility completely when the ejaculate was used for insemination. The semen charactreated than in untreated boars, but the sperm morphology was otherwise normal. In vitro addition of 5 mg/epididymal contents from the treated boars revealed normal Na+, K+ and glycerylphosphorylcholine concentrations. The movement of sperm cytoplasmic droplets was completed on all spermatozoa more distally in treated than in untreated boars, but the sperm morphology was otherwise normal. In vitro addition of 5 mg/100 ml of alpha-chlorohydrin to ejaculate boar semen completely inhibited and 2.5 mg/100 ml decreased fertility. Removal of the alpha-chlorohydrin prior to insemination partially restored fertility. 14C-alpha-chlorohydrin was shown to be more firmly bound to boar spermatozoa than 14C-carboxyinulin and could not be removed from the spermatozoa with 3 washings. The contraceptive mechanism of the drug is suggested to be alkylation of the sperm membrane by free alpha-chlorohydrin in the epididymis.\n",
      "Active transport system in human spermatozoa. The presence of potassium influx into human spermatozoa was investigated through the use of radioactive K42 and Rb86. A gradient of potassium and sodium has been found between the spermatozoal midpiece-tail region and seminal plasma. The influx of potassium seemed to correlate with spermatozoal motility.\n",
      "Sperm antibodies in serum and seminal plasma. The relation between sperm antibodies (agglutinins and IF-antibodies) in serum and seminal plasma was studied in three selected groups of male partners in infertile couples with respect to specificity, concentrations and immunoglobulin classes. Agglutinins were found in seminal plasma only when they were also present in serum, but there was no strict correlation between the titres in seminal plasma and serum although serum titres were always the higher ones. However, in cases with tail-to-tail agglutinins a difference of more than 2 fourfold steps between the titres was never found; spontaneous agglutination in the ejaculate generally occurred when the seminal plasma titre was 64 or more, and in 6 patients with high seminal plasma titres IgA was detected in the midpiece region of ejaculated spermatozoa. In contrast, head-to-head agglutinins were found in seminal plasma in only one of 3 patients with these agglutinins in serum, and only in a low titre. Absorption of IgG of IgG with protein-A-producing Staphylococcus aureus showed that tail-to-tail agglutinins in serum were IgG antibodies, whereas they could be characterized as \"non-IgA-in seminal plasma, suggesting a local production of these antibodies. IF-antibodies were rarely found in seminal plasma and seemed to be of little significance in relation to infertility in men.\n",
      "[Clinical and experimental observations on idiopathic urticaria due to the contact with heat]. This study describes the probably eleventh case, mentioned in literature, of acquired heat contact uticaria in an otherwise healthy young woman. With regard to true contact induction heat contact urticaria clearly differs from the more common cholinergic uticaria. On the other hand, heat contact urticaria is completely analogous to cold uticaria because of the exposure area, reversible blocking by unphysiological prolonged heating of the skin, sensitivity to antihistamines and resistance to corticosteroids. In this case, whealing of the skin occurred on exposure to heating of 39 degrees C for 5 min. With a temperature of 44-46 degrees C, The shortest time for wheal induction was 3-5 sec. At 70 degrees C, the shortest time for maximal reaction was only a split second. An \"optimal temperature\" for wheal induction could not be determined. Local anaesthesia with 2% Xylocain caused a considerable blocking of wheals. Histamine and cholinergic drugs showed normal skin reactions after intradermal injection. Antihistamines administered parenterally or perorally were highly effective. Corticosteroids, however, given systemically in high doses proved to be ineffective. During our observations, a spontaneous remission appeared with a clinical symptom-free state; on unphysiological high temperature stimulus, however, contact uticaria could still be demonstrated. The pathogenetic uniformity of sporadic heat contact urticaria and problems of therapeutical controls are discussed.\n",

Polarization of fluorescence measurements on aspartate aminotransferase (from pig heart cytosol) labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate have been used to detect the formation of a soluble complex of this protein wich glutamate dehydrogenase from bovine liver. The binding of the labeled transaminase to dehydrogenase is detectable at catalytic concentrations of the enzymes.\n",
      "Lubrication and cartilage. Mechanisms of lubrication of human synovial joints have been analysed in terms of the operating conditions of the joint, the synovial fluid and articular cartilage. In the hip and knee during a walking cycle the load may rise up to four times body weight. In the knee on dropping one metre the load may go up to 25 time body weight. The elastic modulus of cartilage is similar to that of the synthetic rubber of a car tyre. The cartilage surface is rough and in elderly specimens the centre line average is 2-75 mum. The friction force generated in reciprocating tests shows that both cartilage and synovial fluid are important in lubrication. The viscosity-shear rate relationships of normal synovial fluid show that it is non-Newtonian. Osteoarthrosic fluid is less so and rheumatoid fluid is more nearly Newtonian. Experiments with hip joints in a pendulum machine show that fluid film lubrication obtains at some phases of joint action. Boundary lubrication prevails under certain conditions and has been examined with a reciprocating friction machine. Digestion of hyaluronate does not alter the boundary lubrication, but trypsin digestion does. Surface active substances (lauryl sulphate and cetyl 3-ammonium bromide) give a lubricating ability similar to that of synovial fluid. The effectiveness of the two substances varies with pH.\n",
      "Urea transport-defective strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Experiments characterizing the urea active transport system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that (i) formamide and acetamide are strong competitive inhibitors of urea accumulation, (ii) uptake is maximal at pH 3.3 and is 80% inhibited at pH 6.0, and (iii) adenosine 5'-triphosphate generated by glycolysis in conjunction with formation of an ion gradient is likely the driving force behind urea transport. Mutant strains were isolated that are unable to accumulate urea at external concentrations of 0.25 mM. These strains also exhibit a depressed growth rate on 10 mM urea, indicating existence of a relationship between the active transport and facilitated diffusion modes of urea uptake.\n",
      "Physiological factors affecting transformation of Azotobacter vinelandii. Cells of Azotobacter vinelandii (ATCC 12837) can be transformed by exogenous deoxyribonucleic acid towards the end of exponential growth. Transformation occurs at very low frequencies when the deoxyribonucleic acid is purified or when the transformation is carried out in liquid medium. Optimal transformation occurs on plates of Burk nitrogen-free glucose medium containing either high phosphate (10 mM) or low calcium (0 to 0.29 mM) content. Higher levels of calcium are inhibitory, whereas magnesium ions are essential for transformation and growth. Extracellular polymer and capsule are increasingly inhibitory to transformation and are most abundant when the calcium content of the medium is high. Transformation is optimal at pH 7.0 to 7.1 and at 30 C, conditions which also coincide with minimal extracellular polymer production. Nonencapsulated strains are excellent transformation recipients. Glycine-induced pleomorphism reduces the transformation frequency and the degree of inhibition is dependent on the phosphate concentration of the medium. Rifampin resistance and shifts from adenine, hypoxanthine, uracil, and nitrogenase auxotrophy to prototrophy can be achieved. Although single marker transfer is always greater than double marker transfer, the data suggest that rifampin resistance is linked to hypoxanthine, adenine and uracil protorophy at intervals of increasing distance. Rifampin resistance did not appear to be linked to nitrogenase.\n",
      "Role of D-tryptophan oxidase in D-tryptophan utilization by Escherichia coli. Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 that require L-tryptophan (trp) are normally unable to utilize D-tryptophan to fulfill their requirement. However, secondary mutations (dadR) that confer this ability can be isolated. In such strains two distinct enzymes are found to be produced at high levels: D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3) and D-tryptophan oxidase. A convenient assay procedure for D-tryptophan oxidase is described. The two enzymes could be distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to inhibition by L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. Strains that were trp dadR could not grow with D-tryptophan in the presence of L-phenylalanine, but further mutations, Fyo, could be isolated that allowed growth under these conditions. Some of them were characterized by further increases in the level of D-tryptophan oxidase activity and a sharp decrease in D-amino acid oxidase. These kinds of Fyo mutations lay in or near the dadR gene. The substrate specificity of the two enzymes toward a large number of compounds was examined. The transamination of aromatic keto acids was investigated. In the wild-type strain only a single enzyme, transaminase A (EC 2.6.1.5), was found, and it was irreversibly activated when subjected to elevated temperatures. The present state of our knowledge on D-amino acid utilization in E. coli is summarized.\n",

We have used P1 transduction to create intergeneric hybrid strains of enteric bacteria by moving the genA and hut genes between Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The use of E. coli as the recipient in such transductions permits the construction of episomes and specialized transducing phage containing non-E. coli material. The effect of host restriction modification and deoxyribonucleic acid homology on the frequency of intergeneric transduction of these loci has been examined.\n",

      "Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-stimulated cyanide-insensitive respiration in mitochondria of Moniliella tomentosa. Mitochondria of the yeastlike fungus Moniliella tomentosa oxidize reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, succinate, isocitrate, and lactate. These oxidations are completely inhibited by cyanide or antimycin A in mitochondria isolated from cells grown in the standard medium. On the other hand, the oxidation of all substrates, except lactate, is almost completely insensitive to cyanide or antimycin A in mitochondria from cells grown in the presence of ethidium bromide. In this instance, the oxidation is mainly mediated by an alternate oxidase which can be blocked by salicyl hydroxamic acid. The alternate oxidase can be specifically stimulated by adenosine 5'-monophosphate and this provides a new method for the characterization of the alternate oxidase in mitochondria of M. tomentosa.\n",
      "Sulfate-reducing pathway in Escherichia coli involving bound intermediates. Although a sulfate-reducing pathway in Escherichia coli involving free sulfite and sulfide has been suggested, it is shown that, as in Chlorella, a pathway involving bound intermediates is also present. E. coli extracts contained a sulfotransferase that transferred the sulfonyl group from a nucleosidephosphosulfate to an acceptor to form an organic thiosulfate. This enzyme was specific for adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate, did not utilize adenine 5'-phosphosulfate, and transferred to a carrier molecule that was identical with thioredoxin in molecular weight and amino acid composition. In the absence of thioredoxin, only very low levels of the transfer of the sulfo group to thiols was observed. As in Chlorella, thiosulfonate reductase activity that reduced glutathione-S-SO3- to bound sulfide could be detected. In E. coli, this enzyme used reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and Mg2+, but did not require the addition of ferredoxin or ferredoxin nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase. Although in Chlorella the thiosulfonate reductase appears to be a different enzyme from the sulfite reductase, the E. coli thiosulfonate reductase and sulfite reductase may be activities of the same enzyme.\n",
      "An endonuclease from Escherichia coli that introduces single polynucleotide chain scissions in ultraviolet-irradiated DNA. An endonuclease that makes single polynucleotide chain scissions in ultraviolet-irradiated DNA has been purified from Escherichia coli. The activity has the following properties: (a) unirradiated DNA is attacked very little if at all; (b) single strand DNA is not attacked, whether irradiated or not; (c) there is no requirement for divalent cations and the activity is not affected by the addition of EDTA; (d) the pH optimum is approximately 7; (e) the activity is inhibited by 1 M NaCl, single strand DNA, transfer RNA and double strand DNA; (f) the sedimentation coefficient, S20,w, is approximately 2.6; (g) it is a basic protein. The enzyme is tentatively named E. coli endonuclease III. The physiological function of the endonuclease has not yet been established.\n",
      "Quaternary conformational changes in human hemoglobin studied by laser photolysis of carboxyhemoglobin. These experiments indicate that absorbance changes observed at the 425 nm isosbestic point of the Hb and HbCO following laser photolysis of HbCO provide a direct measure of the rates of quaternary conformational changes between rapidly reacting Hb (the immediate product of full photolysis) and slowly reacting normal deoxyhemoglobin. Hb, first observed by Gibson (Gibson, Q.H. (1959) Biochem. J. 71, 293-303), Has been interpreted as deoxyhemoglobin remaining in the liganded quaternary conformation following rapid removal of ligand by a light pulse. In borate buffers between pH 8.4 and 9.6 particularly simple pH-independent results were obtained which allowed the use of a Monod. Wyman, and Changeux model (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118) to fit the data. In this case Hb is taken to be R state deoxyhemoglobin. Partial photolysis experiments at 425 nm show that the rate of the R - T conformational change at 20 degrees decreases by about a factor of 2 for each additional bound ligand. The rate of the ligand-free conformational change is found to be 920 +/- 60s(-1), 6400 +/- 600s(-1), and 15,700 +/- 700(-1) respectively at 3 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees. The previously uninterpreted effects of flash length and partial photolysis on the CO recombination kinetics can be explained in terms of the present model. Kinetic results obtained below pH 8 are found to be inconsistent with a two-state model. It appears that binding of inositol hexaphosphate produces a new rapidly reacting quaternary conformation of HbCO.\n",
      "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor from rat brain. Partial purification and characterization. A protein capable of binding atropine and (3H)propylbenzilylcholine mustard was solubilized and purified (200-fold) from rat brain. Pronase and trypsin, but not phospholipases, diminished the binding capacity of the solubilized receptor. The molecular weight of the salt-solubilized receptor as determined by gel filtration in the absence of detergents is 30,000. The purified protein showed specificity of binding toward muscarinic ligands. the high and low affinity dissociation constants of the receptor.atropine complex are 0.3 nM and 0.15 muM. Binding of atropine is pH-dependent with an optimum at 7.1. Ca2+ influences the binding of atropine and maximal binding occurs at 0.5 mM Ca2+. The subcellular distribution of the receptor was also examined.\n",
      "Quantitative relationships between phosphorylation, electron flow, and internal hydrogen ion concentrations in spinach chloroplasts. 1. Further evidence that the uptake of [14C]hexylamine, determined by centrifugal filtration of spinach chloroplast thylakoids through silicone fluid layers, gives precise estimations of light-induced H+ concentration gradients (deltapH) is presented. DeltapH was independent of the amount of thylakoids used or of the concentration of hexylamine. Moreover, hexylamine uptake was sensitive to the osmolarity of the suspending medium. 2. Internal H+ concentration ([H+]in) is proportional to the rate of electron flow when light intensity was used to vary these parameters. Proportionality was still observed in the presence of 0.1 and 1.0 muM gramicidin D. When, however, [H+]in and electron flow were varied by increasing the concentration of gramicidin D, at constant light intensity the rate of electron flow was approximately proportional to 1/[H]in. 3. The phosphorylation efficiency (P/e2 ratio) falls with decreasing light intensity or increasing concentrations of the phosphorylation inhibitor, 4'-deoxyphlorizin. The proportionality between the rate of electron flow and [H+]in allows the calculation of the rate of nonphosphorylating (basal) electron flow if [H+]in under phosphorylating conditions is known. The contribution of basal electron flow, a consequence of passive efflux of H+ from the thylakoids, to the overall rate of electron flow increases as the rate of phosphorylation decreases. P/e2 ratios calculated using rates of electron flow from which the basal component has been subtracted are constant. A calculated P/e2 ratio of about 1.3 is obtained. 4. It is shown that the reciprocal of the phosphorylation efficiency should be proportional to 1/[H+]in2 when these parameters are varied using light intensity. This relationship was verified and provided an estimate of the P/e2 at infinite [H+]in. This value was 1.3. These results provide further evidence that a H+ electrochemical gradient serves to couple photophosphorylation to electron flow and that the rate of phosphorylation is proportional to [H+]in3. That is, three H+ are translocated out of thylakoids for each adenosine triphosphate formed.\n",
      "Kinetic properties of human placental aromatase. Application of an assay measuring 3H2O release from 1beta,2beta-3H-androgens. The rapid and sensitive assay of 1beta,2beta-3H-androgen aromatization by measurement of 3H2O release (Thompson, E.A., Jr., and Siiteri, P.K. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5364-5372) has been analyzed to determine its applicability to initial rate studies. It was found that aromatization is the sole reaction catalyzed by lyophilized placental microsomes that causes a loss of tritium from position 1 or 2 of androstenedione and testosterone. Tritium is, however, removed from position 2 of the estrogen products, presumably in 2-hydroxylation, but this does not invalidate use of the assay for initial rate measurements; it was therefore used to characterize the catalytic properties of aromatase. Aromatization by the freeze-dried preparation was stimulated by K+, EDTA, and dithiothreitol, and was maximally active at pH 7.5 TO 8.0. With incubation conditions optimized for these factors, the apparent Km for NADPH is approximately 1 muM. The maximum velocity of androstenedione aromatization exceeds that of testosterone, and the affinity of the substrate binding site is higher for the former substrate, the apparent Km values being 0.1 muM and 0.4 muM, respectively. Mutual competition experiments with the androgen substrates showed that each gives simple competitive inhibition of the other's aromatization; furthermore, the apparent Ki values for each are in close agreement with their respective Km values. Androst-1,4,6-triene-3,17-dione competitively inhibits the aromatization of both androstenedione and testosterone, the apparent Ki, in both cases being 0.2 muM. It is concluded that the two androgen substrates are aromatized at a single, identical site.\n",
      "Apparent oxidation-reduction potential of Clostridium acidi-urici ferredoxin. Effect of pH, ionic strength, and amino acid replacements. The effects of pH and ionic strength on the midpoint reduction potential (Emp) of Clostridium acidi-urici ferredoxin were determined using hydrogen gas and hydrogenase. The Emp of native ferredoxin at 24-25 degrees in 0.1 M Tris-chloride buffer, pH 7.0, is--0.434 V. In the pH range examined, the Emp becomes approximately 13 mv more negative per each pH unit increase. A plot of the log of ionic strength versus the apparent Emp of ferredoxin in 0.1 M Tris-chloride buffer, pH 7.5, Was linear over the range of 1.0 to 0.01 ionic strength with Emp values of--0.414 and--0.475 V, respectively, at these extremes. This effect is the same with sodium chloride, sodium bromide, or ammonium sulfate. Potassium phosphate buffer caused a similar change, but the absolute values of Emp differed from those obtained in the presence of the other salts. This effect of pH and ionic strength on Emp may be general for clostridial-type (Fe4S4)2-ferredoxins, since the apparent Emp of Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin is affected in a similar manner by these two variables. The Emp of this ferredoxin in 0.1 M Tris-chloride buffer pH 7.0, is--0.405 V. Since the NH2-terminal amino acid residue, Ala1, and Tyr2 of C. acidi urici ferredoxin are near an (Fe4S4)2-cluster in the protein, the apparent Emp of derivatives that contained amino acid replacements in these two positions were determined. Under similar conditions, the Emp of most of the 13 derivatives examined, including those of [Leu2]- and[3-NH2-Tyr30]ferredoxin, is approximately the same as that of native ferredoxin. However, the Emp of [His2]ferredoxin is approximately 15 mv more positive, whereas that of [Trp2]ferredoxin is 22 mv more negative than that of native C. acidi-urici ferredoxin. Variations in sodium chloride concentration and pH also affected the apparent Emp of the derivatives. It is suggested that the changes observed in the Emp of C. acidi-urici ferredoxin are caused by protein conformational changes.\n",
      "A deoxyribonucleic acid kinase from nuclei of rat liver. Purification and properties. A DNA kinase has been partially purified from rat liver nuclei by a procedure which also yields DNA ligase. The kinase uses ATP to phosphorylate specifically the 5'-hydroxyl termini of oligodeoxynucleotides and of single- or double-stranded DNA, yielding 5'-phosphate termini and ADP. The kinase is inactive on RNA, or on oligodeoxynucleotides of chain length less than approximately 10 to 12 residues. The kinase requires a divalent cation (Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, or Ca2+) for activity and has an acidic pH optimum. It is inhibited by a variety of nucleotides as well as by very low levels of inorganic and organic sulfate compounds and sulfate analogues. The molecular weight of the kinase is estimated to be 8 times 10(4) from gel filtration.\n",
      "Hydrogen exchange at the amide group of reduced pyridine nucleotides and the inhibition of that reaction by dehydrogenases. Stopped flow ultraviolet spectroscopy has been used to measure the rate of hydrogen exchange with solvent at the amide group of reduced nicotinamide nucleotide coenzymes. Several mechanisms for the exchange reaction are considered in the light of the kinetic data. Complex formation between the coenzyme and any of four dehydrogenases markedly slows the rate of hydrogen exchange. Hydrogen bond formation and/or hydrophobic interactions within these complexes are thought to be the reasons for the decreased rate of exchange.\n",
      "A Dacron wool packed-bed extracorporeal reactor: a kinetic study of immobilized Escherichia coli II L-asparaginase. An extracorporeal reactor containing a packed bed of Dacron fibers has been developed. Escherichia coli II L-asparaginase was coupled to the Dacron using gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde. The preparation had an activity of 37 IU per gram of Dacron (37 degrees C). The apparent Km was studied as a function of the flow rate. The data indicated that the apparent Km approached the Km of the native enzyme at flow rates of about 300 mg/min. In vivo use of L-asparaginase immobilized on the Dacron indicated effective lowering of plasmatic L-asparagine levels.\n",

Successful harvest made possible with inhibitions of platelet aggregation; enrichment achieved with a two-step separation technique. Methods have been devised to harvest megakaryocytes from guinea pig femoral marrow and to isolate them in high yield. When marrow tissue was disaggregated the megakaryocytes underwent degenerative changes characterized by the loss of cytoplasmic granules and alterations in membrane topography, similar to the changes seen in aggregating platelets. These morphologic changes were interpreted to mean that megakaryocytes possessed functional attributes of platelets. The use of agents which inhibit platelt aggregation (0.38% sodium citrate. 10(-3) M adenosine, and 2 x 10(-3) M theophylline) in a medium free of bivalent cations prevented these changes. This solution resulted in both an excellent morphologic preservation and a significantly increased recovery of megakaryocytes from marrow tissue. A two-step purification of the intact megakaryocytes was carried out on the basis of their low density and large size, with equilibrium density gradient centrifugation followed by velocity sedimentation. This sequence gave approximately a 100-fold enrichment of megakaryocytes, significantly better than that achieved with either method alone. These techniques for harvesting and concentrating megakaryocytes make it possible for the first time to study megakaryocytes in vitro.\n",
      "The polymerization of actin. III. Aggregates of nonfilamentous actin and its associated proteins: a storage form of actin. When echinoderm sperm are treated with the detergent Triton X-100 at pH 6.4 in 10 mM phosphate buffer, the membranes are solubilized, but the actin which is located in the periacrosomal region remains as a phase-dense cup. These cups can be isolated free from the flagella and chromatin and can be solubilized by increasing the pH to 8.0 and by changing the ionic strength and type of buffer used. Since the actin does not exist in the \"F\" state in unreacted sperm, and since the actin remains as a unit that does not diffuse away, it must be present in the mature sperm in a bound or storage state. The actin is, in fact, associated with a pair of proteins whose mol wt are 250,000 and 230,000. When the isolated cups are digested with trypsin, these high molecular weight proteins are digested, thereby liberating the actin. The actin will polymerize if heavy meromyosin or subfragment 1 is added to a preparation of isolated cups. Evidence is presented that this pair of high molecular weight proteins is similar in molecular weight and properties to erythrocyte spectrin. Attempts at transforming the storage form of actin in the cup into filaments were only moderately successful. The best conditions for filament formation involve incubating the cup in ATP and divalent salts. Careful examination of these cups reveals that the actin polymerized preferentially on either end of oriented filaments that already exist in the cup, indicating that self-nucleation is inefficacious. I conclude that the actin can exist in the storage form by its association with spectrin-like molecules and that the actin in this state polymerizes preferentially onto existing filaments.\n",
      "Degradation of abnormal proteins in HeLa cells. The experiments show that abnoramal proteins are degraded faster than normal ones in HeLa cells. Among the fragmentary proteins made in the presence of puromycin, those with low molecular weight are least stable. Proteins made after incubation with 5-fluorouracil or in the presence of some amino acid analogues are also unstable. Breakdown of proteins made in the presence or absence of puromycin is nearly unaffected by cycloheximide and is independent of pH between 7 and 8.\n",
      "The effect of pH on incorporation of galactose by a normal human cell line and cell lines from patients with defective galactose metabolism. Incorporation of radioactive galactose into TCA-insoluble material of galactosemic fibroblasts is more sensitive to low pH than is the incorporation by normal human fibroblasts. This study was undertaken to determine (1) whether there was any pH which could correct or counteract the galactosemic defect relative to galactose incorporation, and (2) whether the low pH effect was specific for galactose metabolism or whether general cellular metabolism in galactosemic cells was more sensitive to low pH than that in normal cells. The pH dependencies of incorporation of radioactive galactose and glucose into cellular macromolecules were investigated in galactosemic and normal cells. Normal cells have a biphasic curve with respect to galactose incorporation with peaks at pH 7.0 and 8.5. Galactosemic cells have only the high pH peak. The maximum incorporation by galactosemic cells was never more than about 30% that seen by normal cells under the conditions of these experiments. Thus manipulation of the pH alone cannot correct the galactosemic defect. The rate of incorporation of radioactive galactose was studied in normal, galactosemic and galactokinase deficient cells, at pH 7.2 and at pH 6.3. At pH 7.2, galactosemic cells incorporate galactose at a linear rate which is 30 to 40% that of normal cells while incorporation by kinase-deficient cells is between 5 and 10% of normal. At pH 6.3, the incorporation is also linear. However, galactosemic cells now exhibit the same rate as kinase-deficient cells in which the low level of incorporation is unaffected by pH. These results suggest that incorporation of galactose by galactosemic cells at low pH is not due to metabolic death of the cells, but may be due to the inhibition of some specific step or steps along a metabolic route of galactose metabolism other than the Leloir pathway.\n",
      "Chromatography of hemoglobins on CM-cellulose with bis-tris and sodium chloride developers. CM-Cellulose as an ion-exchange medium with Bis-tris as buffer and a gradient of sodium chloride provides a versatile system for the chromatography of hemoglobins. Changes in pH, Bis-tris concentration, and slope of the sodium chloride grandient provide means for markedly altering chromatographic behavior for special separations. Examples are given of the application of the method to normal samples and to those with hemoglobinopathies.\n",

      "Stability of fluorescent antibody conjugates stored under various conditions. Two experiments were carried out to determine the stability of fluorescent antibody conjugates. In experiment 1, Francisella tularemia conjugates in the lyophilized state retained their original staining titer for 1,294 days when stored at 25, 4 to 5, and -20 C; at 37 C the conjugates were stable for at least 65 days. In the liquid state at pH 7.4 and 8.0 these conjugates were stable for 1,294 days at 4 to 5 and -20 C, whereas those stored at 25 C remained stable through days 473 and 160 of storage, respectively, after which the staining titer gradually dropped. In experiment 2 five previously lyophilized conjugates were rehydrated with three different diluents and stored at 4 to 5 C for up to 600 days at their working dilutions. All of these conjugates retained their original staining titer during the test period except an anti-human globulin conjugate rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Recommendations are made for the long-term storage of fluorescent antibody conjugates.\n",
      "Inactivation of viruses in serum with binary ethyleneimine. The inactivation os six strains from three different groups of viruses with 0.001 M binary ethyleneimine at 37 C proceeded at the same rate in either bovine serum or cell culture medium. The inactivant did not impair the growth-promoting capacity of bovine serum used in cell culture, nor did it affect the antibody activity of guinea pig hyperimmune serum.\n",
      "Inorganic phosphate homeostasis. Renal adaptation to the dietary intake in intact and thyroparathyroidectomized rats. The possibility of renal tubular adaptation to variations in dietary inorganic phosphate (Pi) was investigated in intact and thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats pair-fed diets containing low, normal, and high amounts of Pi for periods up to 10 days. Clearances were measured before and during active i.v. infusions with Pi in conscious animals. Thus tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRPi) could be assessed over a wide range of plasma phosphate concentrations ([Pi]P1). It was found that the renal tubule could adapt its capacity to transport Pi according to the dietary Pi: TRPi was always higher, for a given [Pi]P1, in the animals fed low than in those fed higher Pi diets. This diet-induced modification also occurred in the absence of thyroparathyroid glands, in the presence of the same calcemia and urinary pH, and during marked extracellular volume expansion. A time-course study in rats TPTX both before and during the administration of the experimental diets showed that a difference in the tubular handling of Pi was detectable as early as 3 days after switching the animals from a normal to low- or high-Pi diets. These results indicate that factors other than parathyroid hormone are implicated in the tubular response to variations in the dietary intake of inorganic phosphate.\n",
      "Effect of beta adrenergic blockade on renin response to renal nerve stimulation. The ability of d,l-propranolol to block renin secretion in response to various extrarenal stimuli, such as hemorrhage and hypoglycemia, has been interpreted to indicate the presence of an intrarenal beta receptor regulating renin release. However, two problems complicate this interpretation: (a) the stimuli have effects outside the kidney, and (b) d,l-propranolol has a local anesthetic, as well as a beta adrenergic blocking, action. In the present study, the effects of a purely intrarenal stimulus, in the form of renal nerve stimulation (RNS), on renin secretion was examined. The effects of d,l-propranolol (anesthetic and beta-blocking activity), l-propranolol (beta-blocking activity only), and d-propranolol (local anesthetic activity only) on the renin response to RNS were examined. In a control group of animals, two sequential RNS increased mean renin secretion from 401 to 1,255 U/min (P less than 0.25) and from 220 to 2,179 U/min (P less than 0.01). In a second group the first RNS increased renin secretion from 201 to 1,181 U/min (P less than 0.01), but after d,l-propranolol was given RNS did not significantly alter renin secretion (33 to 55 U/min). In a third group the initial RNS increased renin secretion from 378 to 1,802 U/min (P less than 0.025), but after l-propranolol was given RNS had no significant effect on renin secretion (84 to 51 U/min). A fourth group of dogs showed a rise in renin secretion from 205 to 880 U/min (P less than 0.001) in response to the first RNS, while the second RNS, given after an infusion of d-propranolol, caused a rise in renin secretion from 80 to 482 (P less than 0.005). The nature of the electrical stimulus was consistent in all groups and caused no detectable changes in renal or systemic hemodynamics or in urinary electrolyte excretion. The results, therefore, indicate that renin secretion can be stimulated through intrarenal beta receptors independent of changes in systemic or renal hemodynamics or in tubular sodium reabsorption. Hence the effect of beta stimulation on renin secretion would appear to result from a direct action on the renin-secreting cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.\n",
      "Identification and characterization of a bile acid receptor in isolated liver surface membranes. It is generally assumed that hepatic transport of bile acids is a carrier-mediated process. However, the basic mechanisms by which these organic anions are translocated across the liver cell surface membrane are not well understood. Since carrier-mediated transport involved binding of the transported molecule to specific receptor sites, we have investigated the possibility that bile acid receptors are present in liver surface membranes. Isolated liver surface membranes were incubated at 4 degrees C with [14C]cholic acid and [14C]taurocholic acid, and membrane-boudn bile acid was separated from free by a rapid ultrafiltration technique through glass-fiber filters. Specific bile acid binding is rapid and reversible and represents approximately 80% of the total bile acid bound to liver surface membranes. Taurocholic acid binding is independent of the medium pH, while cholic acid binding demonstrates an optimum at pH 6.0. Analysis of equilibrium data for both cholic and taurocholic acid binding indicates that specific binding is saturable and consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while nonspecific binding is nonsaturable. Apparent maximal binding capacity and dissociation constant values indicate a large capacity system of receptors that have an affinity for bile acids comparable to that of the hepatic transport mechanism. Scatchard analysis of the saturation kinetics as well as inhibition studies suggest that bile acids bind to a single and noninteracting class of anion that competes with bile acids for hepatic uptake, also inhibits cholic acid binding. In contrast, no inhibition was demonstrated with indocyanine green and probenecid. Specific bile acid binding is enriched and primarily located in liver surface membranes and found only in tissues involved in bile acid transport. Specific bile acid binding is independnet of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ and does not require metabolic energy. In addition, thiol groups and disulfide are not required for activity at the binding site. However, specific bile acid binding is markedly decreased by low concentrations of proteolytic enzymes and is also decreased by the action of neuraminidase and phospholipases A and C. These results are consistent with the existence of a homogeneous bile acid receptor protein in liver surface membranes. The primary surface membrane location of this receptor, its binding properties, and its ligand specificity suggest that bile acid binding to this receptor may represent the initial interaction in bile acid transport across liver surface membranes.\n",
      "A brief anxiety rating scale in evaluating anxiolytics. The Wang Anxiety Rating Scale (WARS) was designed to evaluate degrees of anxiety in patients receiving anxiolytic medication. WARS contains 12 pertinent symptoms of anxiety: nervousness, restlessness, excitability, irritability, worrying, disturbed concentration, palpitation, insomnia, hostility, tremors, smoking, and excessive perspiration. Frequently encountered side effects of anxiolytic medications are excluded. The validity of the WARS was determined by correlation with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) in a single-blind study in which 20 chronically anxious patients consecutively received placebo (three days), 15 mg clorazepate dipotassium (two weeks), and 22.5 mg clorazepate dipotassium (two weeks). Both anxiety scales, a side effect scale, and a global assessment were completed at regular intervals (periods 0-6). Results show (1) highly significant correlation (P less than 0.001) between WARS and HARS for periods 1-6; (2) greater correlation between HARS and side effect scale than between WARS and side effect scale; (3) greater correlation between WARS and global assessment than between HARS and global assessment; correlated changes in scores for WARS, HARS, and global assessment demonstrate efficacy of active medication.\n",
      "The changing pattern of bacterial sepsis since the introduction of antibiotic therapy. During the six-year period, 1968-1973, sepsis developed in 1 of every 80 patients admitted to the Presbyterian Hospital, New York. In 1 of 133 patients the sepsis was due to Gram-positive organisms, and in 1 of 188 patients to Gram-negative organisms. The mortality rate for Gram-positive cases was 4.4 percent, for Gram-negative cases 19.1 percent, and for urologic cases 15.3 percent (versus 56.25 percent in 1959-1964). Data are presented on the relative incidences of involved pathogens in 1740 cases of Gram-positive sepsis /78 deaths), and in 1236 cases of Gram-negative sepsis (205 deaths). The lowering of the sepsis mortality rate has been the result of preventative measures, early diagnosis, and vigorous treatment. Treatment includes the correction of acidosis and anoxia, early administration of bactericidal antibiotics, and restoration of the microcirculation by administration of corticosteroids, beta-adrenergic drugs, and appropriate diuretics.\n",
      "[Has the pH meter replaced the Apgar score?]. The introduction of measuring the pH appears to place it in competition with Apgar scoring because of its precision. A study of this which has been carried out has illustrated that there are two different criteria for assessing the state of the infant at birth. The usual agreement between pH values and Apgar scoring can be broken when clinical fetal distress has become established before metabolic equilibrium of the infant has become modified. In these circumstances the Apgar score will be bad while the pH will be good.\n",
      "Kinetics of the antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. I. Evidence that suppressor cells function by inhibiting the recruitment and proliferation of antibody-producing cells. For the first 126 hr after immunization of mice with an optimally immunogenic dose (0.5 mug) of Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III), splenic antibody-forming PFC and serum antibody levels were measured at 2- and 8-hr intervals, respectively. PFC were detected at 28 hr after immunization and then increased through 86 hr after immunization; thereafter, the number of PFC remained nearly constant for the next 20 to 24 hr, and then began to decline. In contrast, serum antibody was first detected 60 hr after immunization. The accumulation of serum antibody continued to lag behind the increase in numbers of PFC by 16 to 20 hr until maximal serum antibody levels were attained; curves fitted to the values obtained for each parameter were nearly parallel.\n",
      "Influence of protein restriction on immune functions in NZB mice. The influence of a low protein (6%) diet on the immunologic function of NZB mice was investigated. The low protein intake was associated with decreased weight gain in both male and female NZB mice. The mice fed the low protein diet did not develop splenomegaly, which generally occurs by 7 to 10 months of age in NZB mice fed a normal amount of protein. Further, 7- to 10-month-old NZB mice fed the low protein(6%) diet, maintained: 1) more vigorous antibody production to sheep red blood cells; 2) greater capacity to produce graft-vs-host reactions, and 3) more vigorous cell-mediated \"killer\" cell immunity after immunization against DBA/2 mastocytoma cells than did NZB mice on a normal (22%) protein diet. The decrease of PHA and Con A response which normally occurs with aging in NZB mice was abrogated to some degree by protein restriction. However, response to LPS, which also declines with age in NZB mice, did not appear to be influenced by diet.\n",
      "Characterization of cells that suppress the cytotoxic activity of T lymphocytes. I. Quantitative measurement of inhibitor cells. Target cell lysis by sensitized cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) may be conveniently quantitated by 51Cr release. By fitting to the formula, P (% specfic release) = 100 (1-e-Nat) one obtains alpha, the relative frequency of CTL in N lymphoid cells. Using a microassay and murine sarcoma target cells, we observed an unexpected decrease in lysis whenever effectors obtained from a graft-vs-host reaction were tested at high concentrations. This inhibition was not observed with CTL generated by an MLC reaction. Inhibition could not be explained by nonspecific mechanical 'crowding', reutilization of released isotope, suppression of release from dead target cells, or the particular strain combination and target used. By modifying the formula to allow suppression of CTL by a stochastic cell-cell interaction with suppessor cell, we found that P = 100 (1-e-Nate-Ngamma) adequately fitted the data, where Ngamma is proportional to inhibitor content. An 18- to 24-hr incubation at 37 degrees C but not 4 degrees C allowed selective depletion or enrichment of inhibitors; in mixing experiments, both parameters Nalpha t and Ngamma behaved stoichiometrically as independent cellular properties. The inhibitor was resistant to concentrations of anti-T cell (RAMG) serum + complement which killed -TL. A similar inhibitor arose in vivo during an anti-tumour allograft response. The ability to quantitate CTL and inhibitor activities from titration curves provides a technique for studying the identity and mechanism of suppressor cells acting at the effector stage of cell-mediated immunity.\n",
      "IgM-mediated, T cell-independent suppression of humoral immunity. The immunological unreactive state occurring in (T,G)-A-L nonresponder mice after secondary antigen challenge was investigated. Syngeneic IgM anti-(T,G)-A-L antibody-containing plasma, transferred at the time of the time of primary challenge, induced persistent suppression of autologous specific antibody production. Removal of plasma IgM with goat anti-mu antisera removed the ability of the plasma to supress. The induction and maintenance of the suppressed state were not different in thymectomized or sham-thymectomized animals. Primed animals subjected to graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR) at the time of secondary challenge switched over to IgG production. Animals suppressed by passive antibody transfer reacted to GVHR, at the time of secondary challenge, with specific IgM but not IgG antibody production. Transfused normal spleen cells partially abrogated suppression only when (suppressed) hosts had been lethally irradiated. Spleen cells from antigen-plus-antibody suppressed donors, upon transfer to previously normal, syngeneic hosts, were less immunocompetent than spleen cells from untreated donors. These data are consistent with a model of IgM mediated, T cell-independent persistent suppression of humoral immunity.\n",
      "Secondary IgG responses to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. II. Different cellular requirements for induction and elicitation. Mice primed with a thymus- (T) dependent form of Type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (S3), i.e., S3 coupled to erythrocytes (S3-RBC) produce S3-specific IgG antibody after secondary challenge with either S3 or S3-RBC. The production of IgG antibody by mice challenged with S3 was shown to be T independent since secondary responses were enhanced when mice were treated with anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) at the time of secondary challenge with S3 and T-depleted spleen cells responded as well as unfractionated spleen cells to S3 in an adoptive transfer system. Secondary S3-specific IgG responses in mice challenged with S3-RBC were shown to be T dependent by the same criteria. The results obtained by using S3 as the antigen indicate that IgG-producing B cells (B lambda cells) can recognize and respond to antigen in the absence of helper T cells. On the other hand, T cells were required for the induction of S3-specific memory B lambda cells since mice depleted of T cells by treatment with ALS at the time of priming with S3-RBC failed to produce S3-specific IgG antibody after secondary challenge with either S3-specific IgG antibody after secondary chall-nge with either S3 or S3rbc. Since RBC-specific memory cells were induced in T-deprived mice the results suggest that T cell regulation of IgG antibody production may vary for different antigens.\n",
      "The effect of Bordetella pertussis on the antibody response in mice to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. The effect of an i.p. injection of Bordetella pertussis on the primary humoral immune response in mice to the thymus-independent antigen SIII has been studied. Suppression of the antibody response occurred when pertussis cells were injected at the same time as an optimal immunizing dose of SIII. In contrast, the antibody response to high doses of SIII was enhanced by B. pertussis. When SIII alone was injected, only 19S antibody was detected. However, when B. pertussis was administered with either optimal or high doses of SIII, 7S as well as 19S antibody against SIII was produced.\n",
      "Immunology of DNA. I. The influence of reaction conditions on the Farr assay as used for the detection of anti-ds DNA. The sensitivity and the specificity of the Farr assay for the detection of antibodies to double stranded (ds) DNA depends very much on the reaction conditions. The interaction between ds DNA and anti-ds DNA is inhibited when ionic strength and pH are increased. ds DNA is bound by normal sera at ionic strength lower than 0.11 M NaCl and at physiological ionic strength when the pH is lower than 7.2. Substantial binding of DNA by normal serum takes place in barbitone, borate or Tris-HCl buffers at concentrations of 30 mM or higher, even at a pH higher than 7.2. Such binding is due to Clq and is only partially prevented by heating the serum for 30 min at 56 degrees C, but 10 mM phosphate in the incubation mixture completely prevents it. Standardization of ionic strength, pH, phosphate concentration, incubation volume and DNA-serum ratio enhances the diagnostic usefulness of the Farr assay.\n",
      "A Doppler assay for the antigen--antibody reaction. The specific combination of antigen with antibody was detected rapidly and with high sensitivity by an assay based on particle electrophoresis and laser light scattering. Antibody attachment to dilute suspensions of submicroscopic polystyrene spheres coated with antigen was detected as changes in the Doppler shift of scattered laser light when the suspended particles were subjected to an electric field. Antibody or antigen concentrations in the range of 5--10 nanograms per ml can be detected in 30 min. The principal experimental features of the technique are described and include: a) choice of particles; b) coating procedures; c) treatment for non-specificity; d) choice of measurement medium.\n",
      "California arbovirus (La Crosse) infections. III. Epidemiology of California encephalitis in Minnesota. Mosquitoes (eggs, larvae, and adults), small woodland animals, and residents of an area where California encephalitis is endemic were studied to elucidate the host-vector cycle of La Crosse virus. Elementary schoolchildren from surrounding communities and gray squirrels from another area were tested to compare the prevelence of serum antibodies to La Crosse virus in areas where the disease is endemic with the prevalence of these antibodies in areas where the disease is not endemic. From 1971 to 1974, eight isolations of La Crosse virus were made. Three of the isolates were from adult mosquitoes, one from Aedes triseriatus eggs, and four from A. triseriatus larvae. The isolation of virus from field-collected eggs and larvae confirms previous studies from Wisconsin that suggest that La Crosse virus overwinters in eggs of the mosquite A. triseriatus. In an area where California encephalitis is endemic, 10 of 19 small woodland animals (53%), which are the natural hosts of A. triseriatus, had hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies to La Crosse virus. In contrast, none of 10 squirrels from an area where the disease is not endemic had such antibodies. Fourteen of 79 residents of this area (17.7%) had both types of antibody. Eleven of the 14 seropositive residents lived in one small sector of the community studied, an indication that foci of La Crosse virus activity may be very localized. Elementary schoolchildren from surrounding communitites had a significantly lower prevalence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to La Crosse virus than did the residents of the area where California encephalitis was endemic.\n",
      "Characterization of fatty acid desaturase activity in rat lung microsomes. Preparations of rat lung microsomes containing 0.030-0.050 nmole of cytochromes P-450 and b5 per mg microsomal protein have been observed to contain significant levels of fatty acid desaturase activity. Both stearoyl CoA and palmitoyl CoA are desaturated to their monounsaturated analogues, oleic acid and palmitoleic acid, respectively. Activity (per mg microsomal protein) of the lung preparations varied according to the diet of the animals prior to killing in the order: fat free diet greater than normal rat chow greater than starvation. All preparations exhibited approximately 50% inhibition when incubated in the presence of 0.10 mM CN-. Maximal activity was obtained with the 0.50 mM NADH less activity with equal amounts of NADPH, and there was no synergistic interaction of NADH and NADPH together. The rate of desaturation was linear with protein concentrations between 0.15-1.5 mg microsomal protein/incubation at incubation times up to 8 min. A pH optimum range of 7.0-7.4 was observed. For all variables of fatty acid desaturase activity which were examined, the rate of desaturation of stearoyl CoA was approximately twice that for palmitoyl CoA. These results indicate that the same fatty acid desaturation system which is functional in the liver is also present in significant amounts in mammalian lungs.\n",
      "Effect of unilateral and bilateral castration and cryptorchidism on serum gonadotrophins in the rat. The effects of unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism and castration on serum concentrations of testosterone, FSH and LH in adult male rats were examined. The results provide no evidence for compensatory growth or development of the remaining scrotal testes up to 32 days after unilateral castration, although the scrotal testis of unilaterally cryptorchid rats showed enlargement when compared with those of control rats (P less than 0 - 05) at 32 days. Unilateral treatments had few significant effects on serum hormones, but testosterone was increased on day 4 (P less than 0 - 05) in unilaterally cryptorchid rats and on day 32 (P less than 0 - 05) in unilaterally castrated rats, compared with controls, and FSH levels were higher in unilaterally castrated rats on day 16 (P less than 0 - 05). Bilateral cryptorchidism caused an increase in serum FSH within 4 days (P less than 0 - 05) and in serum LH by 8 days (P less than 0-05) after surgery, with both hormones reaching levels double those found in control rats (P less than 0 - 01) by day 16, while testosterone levels were maintained at or above control values. Bilateral castration resulted in a marked decrease in testosterone levels (P less than 0 - 01) and a sharp increase in serum gonadotrophins. FSH had nearly doubled (P less than 0 - 01) and LH had increased fourfold (P less than 0 - 01) 4 days after castration, their levels reaching 773% (LH) and 287% (FSH) of control values by 32 days (P less than 0 - 01). The observations support the hypothesis of a separate, testosterone-independent feedback system of the testis on the hypophysis.\n",
      "Further evidence for histamine facilitating oestrogen action in the uterus. The effect of doses of estradiol ranging from 0-0125 to 1-6 mug on the uterine weight of the spayed rat was studied 24 h after a single s.c. injection of the hormone. The lowest dose inducing a significant increase in uterine weight was 0-32 mug. When histamine dihydrochloride (50 mg) was simultaneously injected with the hormone, the effect of small doses of oestradiol (0-0125--0-2 mug) was significantly increased. When oestradiol and histamine were administered for 3 successive days, the uterine weight of animals receiving 0-0125 mug oestradiol, if compared with untreated controls, was increased only in the histamine-treated group. When 0-05 mug oestradiol was administered histamine did not modify the increase already produced by the hormone. Spermidine and burimamide, two substances structurally related to histamine, increased [3H]oestradiol uptake by the spayed rat uterus. The latter (an antihistamine drug acting on H2-receptors) as well as pyrathiazine (a histamine releaser having antihistamine properties) decreased the effect of histamine on oestradiol uptake whereas diphenhydramine (an antihistamine drug blocking H1-receptors) did not modify it. Pyrathiazine was itself able to diminish oestradiol uptake.\n",
      "Prolactin stimulation test with perphenazine: an evaluation of plasma prolactin levels and pituitary secretory activity in the rat. Many investigations of the regulation of prolactin synthesis and release are based on single plasma prolactin determinations. The purpose of the present experiment was to ascertain whether groups of rats (i.e. young or adult, male or female animals, being either intact, gonadectomized or gonadectomized and treated with oestrone), differing  in age and/or endocrine status, will react to a single dose of perphenazine by an acute release of pituitary prolactin in proportion to their initial plasma prolactin levels. No consistent relation existed between the classification of the twelve groups of rats into three categories of basal plasma prolactin levels (i.e. less than 20, 25-50, greater than 125 ng/ml) and their response to perphenazine. Even though all groups showed a highly significant increase of plasma prolactin levels the magnitude of the maximum prolactin response at 30 min varied greatly within the groups of one category and thus was not related to the initial prolactin levels. The effect of 14 days of oestrone treatment in increasing plasma prolactin levels in gonadectomized animals was greatest in young and adult male rats, less in young females and not significant in adult females. The results obtained after perphenazine treatment in the latter group made it clear that the effect of oestrogen treatment on prolactin release can be completely blocked by increasing synthesis and/or release of the prolactin-release inhibiting factor (PIF). Since perphenazine induces decrease of pituitary prolactin and a concomitant increase of plasma prolactin levels through lowered PIF-action, the positive effect of oestrogens on prolactin release (as observed in gonadectomized male and young female rats) apparently is caused by a different mode of action. The implications of these findings for the regulation of prolactin release, as affected by the endocrine status of the rat, is discussed. Moreover, comparison of prolactin lost from the pituitary and gained in the circulation of the experimental animals, with amounts of prolactin that were observed to disappear from plasma during the experiment, provided suggestive evidence that the capacity to synthesize and/or eliminate prolactin, after a sudden provoked release of the hormone, differed among the groups. The rates of synthesis by the pituitary, of release from the pituitary into the circulation as well as of elimination of the hormone from the circulation (equally involved in determing actual plasma levels) are thought, therefore, to be far more important for the elucidation of prolactin regulation than single plasma prolactin determinations.\n",
      "Activation and desensitization of platelets by platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from IgE-sensitized basophils. I. Characteristics of the secretory response. The secretion of vasoactive amines from rabbit platelets induced by the platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from IgE-sensitized rabbit basophils, was examined. The secretion required calcium has previously been shown to be noncytotoxic and was optimal in both rate and extent at 37 degrees C and pH 7.2. Different temperature-sensitive steps were rate limiting for secretion above or below 20 degrees C. The rate of secretion was dependent upon the concentration of PAF and also of platelets. Maximal rates were observed with relatively low concentrations of platelets (2.5 X 10(8)/ml), sharply contrasting with other platelet stimuli such as C3 or thrombin. The extent of secretion was dependent upon PAF concentration until a maximum of 50 or 60% of the serotonin was released and then declined with increasing amounts of PAF. This was interpreted to result from the platelets becoming desensitized to the PAF, a process that shuts off the secretion. Such a desensitization was demonstrated and was shown to be stimulus specific, i.e., other stimuli could still induce secretion from PAF-desensitized platelets. PAF extracted with ethanol from the albumin to which it is usually bound during preparation, exhibited similar characteristics, except that secretion of up to 90% of the serotonin was induced. The extracted PAF thus seemed less able to induce the desensitization. Its use did provide important evidence that populations of rabbit platelets are relatively homogenous in their ability to respond to PAF.\n",
      "Activation of platelets by platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from IgE-sensitized basophils. II. The role of serine proteases, cyclic nucleotides, and contractile elements in PAF-induced secretion. Secretion of serotonin from platelets induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from antigen-stimulated, IgE-sensitized rabbit basophils was studied to further characterize the biochemical requirements. Inhibition of secretion with diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DFP) was observed if the DFP was present during the reaction, but not if platelets or PAF were pretreated with the inhibitor. This suggested a role for an activatable serine protease in the secretion. Supporting evidence came from the observation that other protease inhibitors and a variety of low molecular weight amino acid esters were also inhibitory. TAMe was most effective, and AGLMe and LeuMe were inactive, indicating a specificity for different esters. Secretion was reduced by agents that increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), but enhanced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which reduced the levels of cAMP. Concurrent with PAF-induced secretion, a reduction in cAMP levels was observed. No effect of cyclic GMP or cholinergic stimulation was found. Secretion was inhibited by colchicine and enhanced by cytochalasin B, suggesting a role for microfilaments and microtubules. The effects of these three systems on PAF-induced secretion indicate the basic uniformity of the secretory process in platelets (and other cells) whatever the stimulus. The uniqueness of the reaction apparently lies in the stimulus-receptor interaction and the nature of the serine protease which is activated.\n",
      "Acid hydrolases in leukocytes and platelets of normal subjects and in patients with Gaucher's and Fabry's disease. Lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes and platelets were each separated to greater than 95% purity from six normal subjects, three patients with Gaucher's disease, two heterozygotes for Gaucher's disease, and one patient with Fabry's disease. Activities of the following acid hydrolases were determined: \"acid\" (pH 4.0) beta-glucosidase, pH 5.0 beta-glucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, alpha-arabinosidase, alpha-mannosidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-hexosaminidase, and acid phosphatase. Enzymatic activity varied greatly with cell type and the enzyme being measured; the importance of assaying pure preparations especially for heterozygote detection is emphasized. Gaucher's disease patients' cells were found to be deficient in the pH 4.0 acid beta-glucosidase, variable in the pH 5.0 beta-glucosidase, and normal in all other acid hydrolases tested, including acid phosphatase, the activity of which is known to be elevated in plasma. Blood cells of a patient with Fabry's disease were deficient in alpha-galactosidase and normal in all other acid hydrolases tested.\n",
      "Regulation of the oxidative NADP-enzyme tissue levels in Drosophila melanogaster. I. Modulation by dietary carbohydrate and lipid. Wild-type third instar larvae of Drosophilia melanogaster fed a casein-sucrose synthetic diet supplemented with phosphatidylcholine (4 mg/ml) possessed 33% more tissue lipid and a modified fatty acid profile compared to larvae fed a fat free-sucrose diet. The rates of lipid synthesis and pentose shunt activity were 2.1 and 2.2 times greater respectively in larvae fed the fat free-sucrose diet than in fat-sucrose fed animals. The tissue concentrations of acetyl-CoA and acyl-CoA were 80 and 61% higher respectively, CoA 49% lower, and the NADPH/NADP+ ratio greater in fat-sucrose fed larvae than in larvae fed a fat free-sucrose diet. Thus, larvae effectively utilized dietary lipid for lipid synthesis and as a supplementary energy source to carbohydrate.\n",
      "Analysis of acetate non-utilizing (acu) mutants in Aspergillus nidulans. Genetic analysis of 119 acetate non-utilizing (acu) mutants in Aspergillus nidulans revealed ten new loci affecting acetate metabolism in addition to the three previously recognized on the basis of resistance to fluoroacetate and acetate non-utilization. The enzyme lesions associated with mutations at seven of the acu loci are described. These are: facA (= acuA), acetyl-CoA synthase; acuD, isocitrate lyase; acuE, malate synthase; acuF, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; acuG, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase; acuK and acuM, malic enzyme. The acu loci have been mapped and are widely distributed over the genome of A. nidulans. Close linkage has only been found between acuA and acuD (less than 1% recombination). There is no evidence for any pleiotropic mutation in that region affecting the expression of both these genes. Poor induction of the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in mutants lacking acetyl-CoA synthase, and also in the other two classes of fluoroacetate-resistant mutants, indicates that the inducer, acetate, may be metabolized to a true metabolic inducer, perhaps acetyl-CoA, to effect formation of the enzymes. There is no evidence of any other class of pleiotropic recessive acu mutations affecting the expression of the acuD and acuE genes, which are therefore thought to be subject to negative rather than positive control.\n",
      "Predicting individual responses to drug treatment in schizophrenia: a test dose model. The literature and the findings from the Camarillo Schizophrenia Research Project reported in this paper indicate that a satisfactory method for predicting the response of an individual schizophrenic patient to antipsychotic drugs has yet to be devised. A test dose procedure is described which offers promise of a practical approach to selecting the most appropriate drug and dosage for a particular patient and tailoring blood concentrations to the needs of the individual case. Preliminary findings indicate that the test dose procedure is feasible; that detectable changes occur after a single test dose; and that measurements made during the test dose period may be predictive of eventual outcome. These findings are, of course, only a report of a preliminary pilot experiment, subject to important caveats about small number of cases, interpretation of large numbers of correlation coefficients, and need for cross-validation. Nevertheless, they are encouraging and suggest that the test dose approach has considerable potential for further research.\n",
      "On the bimodality of the distribution of electrodermal orienting responses in schizophrenic patients. Data are presented from four of the author's studies on the electrodermal orienting responss which fail to confirm the findings of Gruzelier and Venables of a markedly bimodal distribution of ORs in schizophrenic populations. A review of the findings of other earlier studies, none of which confirm the bimodal hypothesis although some used patients taking phenothiazines, shows that differential effects of drugs, although probably an important factor, by itself cannot account entirely for the discrepancies in results. It is hypothesized that due to changes in hospital discharge policies, the groups of patients tested by Gruzelier and Venables, compared to those tested in earlier studies, were more heavily weighted with patients whose symptoms were resistant to phenothiazines. These patients may either have come from the extremes of the responsivity distribution or have atypical reactions to neuroleptic drugs.\n",
      "Sudden hemorrhage in metastatic thyroid carcinoma of the brain during treatment with iodine-131. A patient with papillary--follicular carcinoma of the thyroid, with metastases to the lungs, skeleton, and brain was treated 5 weeks after thyroidectomy with 135 mCi of 131I. Although preliminary studies with 1 mCi had not shown any iodine uptake by the brain metastasis, this lesion showed intense concentration at the time of the larger therapeutic dose. Four days later, acute hemorrhage of the tumor occurred, requiring surgical removal. Although 131I therapy would seem an unlikely cause of acute necrosis and hemorrhage in these lesions, the association of therapeutic radioiodine and hemorrhage is interesting. Since recent reports suggest that brain metastasis may be somewhat more common than previously suspected, we suggest that brain imaging be included in the workup prior to radioiodine therapy of patients with advanced metastatic disease or neurologic symptoms.\n",
      "Concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis. Concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 4.5 X 10(3) to 3 X 10(8) colony-forming units/ml in 27 patients with bacterial meningitis before antibiotic therapy and from 4 X 10(1) to 1.4 X 10(6) CFU/ml in four patients after one to two days of antibiotic therapy. All patients with persistent positive cultures had pretreatment concentrations of 10(7) CFU/ml or greater. A significant association was observed between cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid dehydrogenase activity and concentrations of bacteria (p less than 0.01). Large inocula of Hemophilus influenzae type b (10(7)) increased the minimal inhibitory concentration for penicillin and ampicillin but not for chloramphenicol. The minimal inhibitory concentration of each of the three antibiotics increased when group B streptococci were assayed. These data indicate that persistence of a positive culture may be related to large initial concentrations of bacteria. The relative \"resistance\" in vitro of large inocula possibly contributes to this persistence. These observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that lactic acid dehydrogenase activity in cerebrospinal fluid is derived from bacteria.\n",
      "Quantitative determination of resorcinol in presence of phenol. A simple and accurate method for the quantitative determination of resorcinol in the presence of phenol is reported. The method is based on the formation of indophenol by reacting resorcinol with 2, 6-dibromoquinone-4-chlorimide. The concentration of indophenol can be measured spectrophotometrically. This method is recommended for the determination of resorcinol in resorcinol-phenol-boric acid solution and carbol-fuchsin solution. The decomposition products of resorcinol and phenol, e.g., colored quinones, do not interfere with the assay procedure.\n",
      "Oil-water distribution of p-alkylpyridines. The distribution of a homologous series of p-alkylpyridines between water and six organic solvents with varying degrees of polarity was investigated. The distribution coefficients were considered as reflections of the strength of net interactions involved in the solvents. The order was chloroform greater than octanol greater than carbon tetrachloride greater than butyl ether greater than hexadecane greater than octane. The effect of the methylene group upon the distribution coefficients differed little among the six solvents. The relative constancy was attributed to the predominance of the dispersion forces in the incremental effect.\n",
      "Neurogenic influences of bilateral adrenalectomy on monoamine oxidase. Bilateral adrenalectomy (10 days) increased the monoamine oxidase activity of the rat heart, vas deferens, spleen, superior cervical ganglion, and hypothalamus but not that of the rest of the brain, kidney, and liver. Experiments were made to determine whether the increased activity was due to neurogenic influences and whether the enhanced activity of monoamine oxidase was intra- or extraneuronally located. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine failed to alter the rise in cardiac monoamine oxidase. Likewise, superior cervical ganglion monoamine oxidase was unaffected by surgical denervation. 6-Hydroxydopamine abolished the increase in monoamine oxidase activity of the vas deferens, spleen, and superior cervical ganglion but failed to alter that of the kidney, hypothalamus, and the rest of the brain. Cardiac monoamine oxidase was reduced markedly by 6-hydroxydopamine, but the remaining activity was still significantly elevated over the respective control values. The data suggest that the increase in organ monoamine oxidase is predominantly of neuronal origin and that this increase is not due to transsynaptic induction.\n",
      "Binding study of tetracyclines to human serum albumin using difference spectrophotometry. The binding of several tetracyclines to human serum albumin was studied using difference spectrophotometry and a spectrophotometric probe, 2-(4'-hydroxybenzeneazo)benzoic acid. Difference spectra observed for the interaction between the probe and human serum albumin were similar to probe-bovine serum albumin spectra but were less intense for a given concentration of probe and did not reach saturation as quickly. Difference spectra for the tetracyclines were dependent on the characteristics of the ring substituents. More hydrophobic substituents on the D and C rings tended to give more intense difference spectra, but charge-transfer complexing may also have been involved since methacycline with a methylene group in the 6-position showed the most intense spectra of the compounds studied. Solvent perturbation, pH, and urea studies tended to confirm that something other than hydrophobic binding of the tetracyclines was involved. Drug-probe displacement studies showed that methacycline gave the greatest probe displacement followed by doxycycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline. This order of displacement of the anionic probe indicates that both hydrophobic and charge-transfer binding are involved. Experiments with calcium ion and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid showed that the difference spectra obtained with the tetracyclines and human serum albumin were not the result of metallic bridge-chelate formation.\n",

      "The antiarrhythmic and cardiovascular properties of 1-dimethyl isopropylamino-3-(2-phenylphenoxy)-propan-2-ol chloride, UM-424. The quarternary ammonium compound, UM-424 [1-dimethyl isopropylamino-3-(2-phenylphenoxy)-propan-2-ol chloride], was evaluated for its antiarrhythmic and hemodynamic effects. UM-424 converted ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in the anesthetized dog when administered in an average dose of 4.6 mg/kg i.v. Pretreatment of anesthetized dogs with UM-424, 10 mg/kg, provided complete protection against the development of premature beats and ventricular fibrillation when the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 20 minutes and then released. UM-424 was effective in reversing ventricular arrhythmias in conscious animals which had been subjected to a two-stage ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery. The mean ectopic rate in a group of five dogs was 143 +/- 4.0 (S.E.M.) beats/min 24 hours after coronary ligation. Normal sinus rhythm was restored with a mean dose of 9.5 mg/kg of UM-424 and was maintained for a period in excess of 60 minutes. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was increased from a control value of 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 26.2 +/- 8.6 mA (P less than .05) 30 minutes after pretreatment with UM-424, 10 mg/kg. Inotropic and chronotropic dose-response studies to isoproterenol in the anesthetized dog demonstrated that the quarternary compound lacked beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties. UM-424, 10 mg/kg, did not produce any persistent changes in spontaneous heart rate, cardiac contractile force, left ventricular dP/ct, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.\n",
      "Acid secretion by guinea-pig isolated stomach. An isolated stomach preparation from the guinea-pig is described. 2. Both histamine acid phosphate (1-4 mug/ml.) and theophylline hydrate (0-2-3-2 mg/ml.) separately stimulated hydrochloric acid, HCl, secretion from the guinea-pig stomach preparation. A linear dose-response relationship was obtained for theophylline. 3. Addition of theophylline (0-2 and 1-6 mg/ml.) during maximal response to histamine increased the secretion further, whereas addition of histamine during maximal response to theophylline did not cause further secretion. 4. The secretory activities of Nalpha-MeH (0-3-5-0 muM), Nalpha-Me2H (1-2-9-5 muM) and 5-MeH (1-5-12 muM) were compared with histamine (0-9-13 muM) on a threshold background secretion induced by theophylline (0-2 mg/ml.). Linear log.-dose response relationships were obtained for each test drug. The results confirm that Nalpha-MeH is a more potent secretagogue than histamine. 5. Pentagastrin (0-3-1-0 mug/ml.) stimulated HCl secretion in approximately half the experiments. The response was often transitory. In the other experiments, pentagastrin had no effect on HCl secretion although subsequent administration of histamine did stimulate HCl secretion.\n",
      "Two components of the calcium current in the egg cell membrane of the tunicate. The Ca current of the egg cell membrane of a certain tunicate, Halocynthia roretzi Drasche, was studied by the voltage-clamp technique. 2. The Ca current in the standard artificial sea water (ASW) was produced at the critical membrane potential of -10 mV after inactivating the Na current by conditioning depolarization, -30 to -15 mV. The Ca current was abolished by replacing Ca in ASW with Mg2+ or Mn2+. The Ca current was not significantly influenced by replacing Na in ASW with choline or Cs. 3. The relation of Ca current to the external Ca concentration was a monotonously increasing function, but was not linear. The current tended to saturate above 50 mM-Ca. In 100 mM-Ca ASW, the maximum peak inward current of Ca ranged from 1 to 7 X 10(-9) A. 4. The kinetics of Ca current was accurately analysed because of the small contribution of K outward current and was found to be relatively slow in comparison with the Na current. The peak time and the half-decay time of the maximum Ca current at about 25 mV were about 25 and 100 msec respectively in 100 mM-Ca ASW at 15 degrees C. 5. Addition of 20 mM-Co2+ to 100 mM-Ca ASW reduced Ca current to one fourth and 1 mM-La3+ to 100 mM-Ca ASW abolished the current. 6. Sr and Ba could substitute for Ca in Ca channels. The selectivity ratios for the 'Ca channels's were Ca (1-00):Sr(1-17):Ba(0-71) at a potential level of +40 mV. The Ca current in the egg cell membrane appeared to be essentially the same as the Ca current in the common excitable membranes, such as the crustacean muscle fibre. 7. The polyvalent cations including Ca ion and monovalent H+ ion showed the stabilizing effect upon both Na and Ca currents, by shifting V-I relations along the voltage axis. From the prediction of a theory of the diffuse double layer, the shift in the V-I relation induced by those cations should be directly related to their binding powers to the membrane. Thus, the sequence of the binding powers was inferred as H+ greater than La3+ greater than Co2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Sr2+ larger than or equal to Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. 9. In Na-free ASW, such as isotonic Ca ASW, Ca current was composed of two components. The one component was the Ca current described in 1 to 6. The other was also dependent upon the external Ca concentration, but showed the more negative critical membrane potential and the faster kinetics. It was concluded that this component should be the Ca current through Na channels. 10. The selectivity among Ca, Sr and Ba for 'Ca' current through 'Na channels' was significantly different from that of 'Ca' current through 'Ca channels', being Ca greater than Sr larger than or equal to Ba = 0.\n",
      "Oestrogenic sensitivity of rat uterine secretion. Ovariectomized adult rats with closed uteri were treated for 7 days with different oral and s..c. doses of oestradiol, oestrone, oestriol and ethinyl oestradiol. All treatments elicited the production of uterine fluid and the potencies of oestrogens were related to the amount of fluid secreted. Ethinyl oestradiol and oestradiol displayed similar activity when given s.c. A daily dose of 0-003 mg oestradiol/kg resulted in about 700 mg fluid. Oestrone was 3-10 times and oestriol about 100 times less active. Orally, ethinyl oestradiol was the most potent substance and 700 mg secretion was obtained with a dose of 0-03 mg/kg daily. Oestradiol was about 30 times, oestrone about 100 times and oestriol 50 times less active than ethinyl oestradiol by this route. The viscosity of the secretion was unaffected, remaining between 1-6 and 2-4 cP. The pH of the fluid did not change, but that of the uterine lumen diminished slightly. These effects of oestrogens were associated with an increase in the weight of the empty uterus and a decrease in body weight.\n",
      "A new series of cardioselective adrenergic beta-receptor blocking compounds. 1-(2-Acyl-4-acylaminophenoxy)-3-isopropylaminopropan-2-ols. A series of 1-(2-acyl-4-acylaminophenoxy)-3-isopropylaminopropan-2-ols has been synthesized and examined for beta-receptor blocking and antiarrhythmic activity. Several of these compounds are more than 20 times as active in blocking cardiac beta-receptors than vascular beta-receptors when given intravenously to anesthetized cats. The activities have been correlated quantitatively with partition and steric substitution constants. The observed relationships are consistent with a tentative proposal that the vascular receptor is situated in a more lipophilic environment than the cardiac receptor so that there is a differential transport effect between the two types of receptor.\n",
      "Teaching interviewing for pediatrics. This paper describes a structured course for teaching interviewing which focuses on the interaction between the patient and the practitioner. Three main areas of learning were selected because of their universal application: relationship, communication, and feelings. Theoretical material is related to positive and negative interactions with patients, and these are described behaviorally in a checklist form. The development of good interviewing techniques consists of increasing the positive interactions and learning to use them as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Different methods are utilized to help students apply these skills in clinical situations. Although this course was developed for a specific group of pediatric practitioners, it can be utilized by all types of health care professionals.\n",
      "Effect of calcium on the membrane potential of Amphiuma red cells. An increase in extracellular Ca concentration causes the membrane of giant red cells of the salamander, Amphiuma means, to undergo a marked, transient hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization is caused by an increase in K permeability of the membrane as judged from the K sensitivity of the membrane potential and from the rate of K loss under influence of raised extracellular Ca concentration. At constant external pH, the induction of hyperpolarization by increased extracellular Ca has a relatively well-defined threshold concentration. Furthermore the phenomenon is of an \"all or none\" type with most of the cells having membrane potential values either in the normal range (about -15 mV) or in the range -40 to -70mV. Shortly after suspension in Ringer's with 15 mm Ca, most if not all of the individual cells are hyperpolarized. Upon continued exposure (5-20 min) to the higher Ca concentration the membrane potential returns to the normal value in a fashion compatible with an \"all or none\" response. The observed Ca effect is sensitive to the pH of the suspending medium. At pH 6.2 the response is absent whereas the hyperpolarization is markedly stronger at pH 8.2 than at PH 7.2. It is argued that a reliable transport number for K under influence of Ca cannot be estimated from the slope of membrane potential vs. log (extracellular K concentration). This is probably related to the fact that the membrane potentials of the cells in the population do not stay constant in time. The above phenomenon is compared with the Ca-induced K permeability in poisoned human red cells or red cell ghosts. It is important to note that the cells employed in the present study are neither poisoned nor mechanically disrupted. This study emphasizes that the role of Ca in regulating cell membrane permeability to K seems to be a general feature.\n",
      "Transitory postnatal hemolysis of calf red cells by amino acids. Among the amino acids which can be solubilized to give a concentration of 300 mm at near physiological pH, histidine and proline caused a complete hemolysis of newborn calf but not of adult cow red cells within 20 to 30 minutes at 38 degrees C. While hydroxyproline, valine, and serine resulted in a partial lysis of calf cells, threonine, glutamine, and glycine were ineffective. In this communication, emphasis has been focused on the mode of the lytic process by histidine which was found to be affected by several governing parameters including the pH, temperature and the extracellular salts in the solution. Unlike human red cells suspended in isotonic histidine, both calf and cow cells lost little Na and K ions. In the presence of 300 mm histidine, both calf and cow cells displayed an instantaneous uptake of histidine amounting to 20 to 45 mumoles/ml RBC followed by a slow influx rate of 0.25 to 0.5 mumoles/ml RBC X min. The extent to which histidine entry was allowed by the cell was counterbalanced by Cl- efflux, resulting in little change in cell volume prior to hemolysis. Moreover, histidine-induced hemolysis can be prevented by 1 mm or lower PCMBS without a discernible effect on histidine influx suggesting a possible membrane lesion or damage at the outer surface of the cell. Hemolysis induced by histidine decreased substantially when a calf reached two months of age at which time the red cells containing the fetal hemoglobin are virtually depleted. The results of hemoglobin electrophoresis obtained during this postnatal period revealed that those cells resistant to histidine hemolysis almost invariably contain the adult type hemoglobin suggesting a selective, specific action of the amino acids on the fetal cells.\n",
      "ATP synthesis driven by a protonmotive force in Streptococcus lactis. An electrochemical potential difference for hydrogen ions ( a protonmotive force) was artifically imposed across the membrane of the anaerobic bacterium Streptococcus lactis. When cells were exposed to the ionophore, valinomycin, the electrical gradient was established by a potassium diffusion potential. A chemical gradient of protons was established by manipulating the transmembrane pH gradient. When the protonmotive force attained a value of 215 mV or greater, net ATP synthesis was catalyzed by the membrane-bound Ca++, Mg++ -stimulated ATPase. This was true whether the protonmotive force was dominated by the membrane potential (negative inside) or the pH gradient (alkaline inside). Under these conditions, ATP synthesis could be blocked by the ATPase inhibitor, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or by ionophores which rendered the membrane specifically permeable to protons. These observations provide strong evidence in support of the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which states that the membrane-bound ATPase couples the inward movement of protons to the synthesis of ATP.\n",
      "Effect of local anesthetics on chloride transport in erythrocytes. The self-exchange of chloride isotopes across the human erythrocyte membrane was inhibited by tetracaine, benzocaine, and lidocaine. The inhibition by tetracaine was increased at higher pH values, but was not exclusively due to the uncharged form of tetracaine. The inhibition was effective within 5 seconds, was reversible, was non competitive with chloride ions, and was not reversed by calcium ions. These findings indicate that local anesthetics react with the erythrocyte chloride carrier at a site separate from the chloride site and cause inhibition of anion transport by a specific mechanism not involving changes in the surface charge density on the erythrocyte membrane.\n",
      "Biochemical properties of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in metastasizing and nonmetastasizing rat mammary carcinomas. The biochemical properties of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in a nonmetastasizing and a spontaneously metastasizing rat mammary carcinoma were compared. The phosphooiesterases in both tumors had a pH optimum of around 8.0 and preferentially hydrolysed cyclic purine nucleotides. The rate of hydrolysis of purine nucleotides in the nonmetastasizing tumor was two times higher than in the metastasizing tumor, but the rate of pyrimidine nucleotide hydrolysis was equal in both tumors. Theophylline, caffeine, and D,L-4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro20-1724) inhibited the enzyme activity in both tumors; the percent inhibition was the same by each inhibitor. The cyclic nucleotie phosphodiesterase activity in either tumor was stimulated by Mg++, Mn++, and Co++ and suppressed by Ca++, Zn,++, and Ni++. EDTA inhibited the activity below the basal level (activity in the absence of added cation), an this inhibition could be recovered up to the basal level by an equimolar quantity of either Mn++ or Mg++. Further stimulation of the enzyme activity with increasing concentrations of divalent cations was observed only with Mn++. Similar effects were observe with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-tn,n-tetraacetic acid. The stimulatory cations affected both the low and high Michaelis constant (tkm) enzymes in these tumors by increasing the maximum velocity. In the low Km enzyme, the Km was also slightly increased. Neither guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate nor adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate had any effect on the hydrolysis of the other at physiologic levels.\n",
      "Hybrid-versus-parental strain reaction. III. Comparative mortality in parental strain mice of the H-2k genotype. Lethally irradiated parental strain male and female mice were inoculated with marrow from reciprocal hybrid donors of the same sex. Hybrid cells homozygous for the H-2k genotype could recognize the quantitatively greater antigenicity of the parental strain CBA male recipients only. The more severe reaction occurred when the maternal strain of the hybrid donor was allogeneic to the recipient, which indicates the maternal effect on the antigen recognition system. This demonstration of a maternal influence on the expression of paternally derived tissue antigens made it possible to attribute the secondary disease syndrome to a hybrid-versus-parental strain reaction. The apparent differences in mortality between male and female recipients could not be attributable to X or Y chromosome disparity without additional transfers of appropriate marrow from males to females and females to males. In all cases, the parental strain-versus-hybrid reaction resulted in greater mortality than that observed in the hybrid-versus-parental strain reaction.\n",
      "Cryptorchidism, hernia, and cancer of the testis. Risk of cancer of the testis was related to nondescent and hernia in a comparison of 596 testicular cancer patients and 602 unaffected men who had been in active service in the U.S. Army between 1950 and 1970. Medical histories were obtained from routine service records. Undescended testis was associated with a testicular cancer risk 8.8 times that of normal. Among cancer patients with a history of undescended testis, seminomas were nearly twice as frequent as in the remaining patients. Of 14 patients with unilateral undescended testis, 12 had the tumor on the side of the defect. Testicular cancer risk was estimated to be 2.9 times higher in men who had reported having had an inguinal hernia than in those who had not. Side of hernia and side of tumor were not associated; histologic type was not related to history of hernia.\n",
      "Hemodynamic and respiratory responses of conscious swine to E. coli endotoxin. The injection of a sublethal bolus of E. coli into conscious swine produces an early increase in PAP and a decrease in LAP. This hemodynamic effect may be secondary to the pulmonary venous constriction seen in other species, or may relate to demonstrated multiple pulmonary microemboli. Hypoxemia developed in only four of 17 animals although all endotoxin-treated swine showed interstitial edema and elevated wet/dry weight ratios with normal pulmonary surfactant. In addition, endotoxin-treated swine developed signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, with renal cortical infarcts in 44%, and coronary arterial thrombi in 28% including one transmural myocardial infarction. This effect was observed in the absence of prolonged hypotension in swine and should provide a useful model for further study of the relationship of endotoxin to disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n",
      "Isoaccepting species of serine tRNA coded by bacteriophage T5sto. By aminoacyl-tRNA-DNA hybridization and chromatographic analysis, evidence was provided that the bacteriophage T5stO codes for two tRNAser species. Trinucleotide- or polynucleotide-stimulated binding experiments assigned the codons UCC or UCU to these two tRNAser species. They also suggested that the synthesis of these two tRNAser species does not modify the reading capacity for codons less used in Escherichia coli F and corresponds to a different situation compared with the T4-coded tRNA's.\n",

Several novel selective sorbents for mouse interferon are described that exploit the hydrophobic property and glycoprotein nature of this molecule. Low-molecular-weight ligands (hydrocarbons) and high-molecular-weight ligands (bovine serum albumin) immobilized on agarose bind selectively mouse L-cell interferon. The high selectivity of binding is due primarily to a hydrophobic effect, although electrostatic forces are also apparently involved. Mouse L-cell interferon binds to immobilized serum albumin and can be completely recovered by raising the ionic strength of the eluant. The specific activity of interferon preparations can be increased 2,000-fold to a value of 3 x 10(8) reference units per mg of protein in a single step with full recovery of the antiviral activity. A selective adsorption, although to a lesser degree, can be also obtained on hydrocarbon-coated agarose (Affi-Gel 202), resulting in 300-fold purification on desorption. The existence of two major components of mouse interferon was revealed upon its chromatography on the following sorbents: (i) bovine serum albumin-agarose, (ii) omega-carboxypentyl-agarose; and (iii) Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin-agarose. This report thus provides for the first time a means for efficient and clear-cut separation of interferon components, thus enabling their further characterization.\n",
      "Induction of prophage SPO2 in Bacillus subtilis: isolation of excised prophage DNA as a covently closed circle. Bacillus subtilis tryC2, thyA, thyB, lysogenic for the phage DNA polymerase negative mutant SPO2 susL244, was induced under conditions preventing phage and bacterial DNA synthesis. The biological activity of DNA from induced cells and from uninduced controls was assayed by transformation and transfection, respectively. About 50% of the phage DNA biological activity in DNA extracted from induced cells was resistant to exposure to pH 11.8 TO 11.9. This DNA was operationally defined as alkali-resistant phage DNA. Transforming bacterial DNA from uninduced or induced cells and transfecting DNA from uninduced cells were more than 95% inactivated after exposure to high pH. The alkali-resistant phage DNA was characterized by sucrose gradient centrifugation, by centrifugation in cesium chloride-propidium iodide, and by electron microscopy. It was found to consist of a majority of covalently closed circular DNA molecules. Length measurements of a few relaxed circular molecules indicate a molecular weight of these similar to that previously found for mature SPO2DNA. Attempts to isolate similar covalently closed circular phage DNA from induced bacteria lysogenic for SPO2 phage with a functional DNA polymerase gene were unsuccessful. The gene order in mature and prophage SPO2 was determined by rescue of single and double markers from the respective type of DNA. The data obtained show that prophage DNA is (genetically) permuted relative to mature DNA. The phage attachment site is suggested to be located between genes I and J.\n",
      "Escherichia coli capsule bacteriophages. VIII. Fragments of bacteriophage 28-1. As described previously, a host capsule depolymerase activity is associated with the particles of Escherichia coli capsule bacteriophage 28-1. This is a large virus with a long, contractile tail terminating in a base plate with spikes. In the present work, isolated virions were exposed to a variety of dissociative reagents and conditions. They were then tested for residual infectivity and depolymerase activity, as well as inspected under an electron microscope. Very mild acid treatment (10 to 15 min at pH 4.0 and 37 C) was found to cause a specific detachment of some phage spikes, together with a moderate drop in both infectivity and depolymerase activity. Large batches of viruses were fragmented in this manner, and the detached spikes were isolated. The host capsule depolymerase activity was found to be associated with these organelles. In negatively stained preparations, the spikes exhibited a length of approximately 18 nm and a thickness of about 5 nm. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they were found to contain polypeptides with molecular weights of 80,000 and 145, 000.\n",
      "Studies on mode of antagonism between adrenergic beta-mimetics and beta-blocking agents (I). Beta-blocking action of mescaline and its derivatives. In order to clarify whether or not trimetoquinol (TMQ) and isoproterenol (ISO) interact with the same receptor, the pA2 values of propranolol (PR) and certain trimethoxybenzene derivatives were measured, using isolated guinea pig tracheal chains. Each of PR, mescaline (MES) and its derivatives gave almost the same pA2 values for TMQ and ISO. Introduction of an alkyl group into the N atom of MES increased the affinity to the receptor in the order of methyl and isopropyl as well as the structureactivity relationship of catecholamines, while that of hydroxyl group in the beta-position of the side chain decreased pA2 values. The slopes of the regression lines for anti-TMQ action of MES derivatives as well as PR were almost one, but those for their anti-ISO action were less than 0.3. 3,4,5-Trimethoxyaniline and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid had little activity as beta-blocking agents. These results suggest the possibility that TMQ and ISO would interact with the same receptor sites. The importance of the trimethoxybenzene and the phenethylamine moieties in the MES-derivatives for anti-TMQ action is discussed.\n",
      "Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by prostaglandin E1 in guinea pig adrenal gland. The action of prostaglandin E1 on tyrosine hydroxylase activity in adrenal slices of guinea pig was studied. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and was decreased by the incubation of adrenal slices with prostaglandin E1 at concentrations beyond 2 mug per ml for 2 hours. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was stimulated by dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in slices of guinea pig adrenal glands. Incubation of adrenal slices wtth the combination of PGE1 and DBc-AMP lead to a tyrosine hydroxylase activity higher than that with PGE1 alone, but not as great as DBc-AMP alone. It was suggested that PGE1 inhibited the enzyme activity independently of the cyclic AMP level. Other prostaglandins such as PGA1 and PGB1 were deficient to the extent that the tyrosine hydroxylase activity was decreased. PGE1 inhibited the enzyme activity much to the same extent seen with protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide and actinomycin D. However, PGE1 did not influence the incorporation of L-leucine-14C into acid insoluble protein. The studies reported here showed that PGE1 inhibited the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase.\n",
      "[The role of HCO3- ATPase in H+ /HCO3-Secretion (author's transl)]. Active buffer transport, e.g. H+ -secretion by stomach and kidney and HCO3--secretion by pancreas and salivary glands, is linked with the presence of a HCO3-stimulated ATP-Phosphohydrolase. In contrast to (Na+ -k+)-ATPase which is considered to be equivalent to the Na+ pump, the HCO3--ATPase requires only one ion for activation and is insensitive to ouabain. The HCO3--ATPase is found in the plasma membrane of the epithelia, but in contrast to the (Na+ -k+)-ATPase it is located in the luminal cell border. The activity of the HCO3--ATPase changes in parallel along with the rate of active buffer transport, a finding which underlines its importance as a transport enzyme. Several disorders of buffer transport are described which are possibly associated with a defect of the HCO3--ATPase system.\n",

After a review of Küntsher's intramedullary nailing, the author resumed the informations about the interlocking medullary nail and its technique. A new device, as a guide instrument for easier application of the transverse bolts was constructed on the basis of authors concept. Using the new technique and guide instrument X-ray television controll is not necessary for placing the bolts in their right places through a small incision. The time of operation and the risk of infection was also diminished by the new technique. The indications for the interlocking medullary nailing have been completed by the author with the pathologic fractures. The first 50 cases, treated by the new technique of the interlocking medullary nailing are analysed and a few cases are reported in detail. Good results have been obtained as regards both the bone union and the functional results.

The indication of the fibulotomia is dealt with. According to the authors' standpoint in the case of the anatomical reposition of the tibial fracture and after its staple synthesis the supporting effect of the fibula is not be be feared. In these cases the reposition and the osteosynthesis of the fibula neutralize fairly well also the motive forces acting on the tibial fracture.\n",
      "[Clinical aspects and pathology of traumatic lesions of the optic nerve]. The cause of the unilateral complete blindness (amaurosis traumatica) occurring in the case of closed cranial injury has been sought for in the optic nerve canal (canalis opticus syndrome). For the decompression of the optic nerve surgical approach has been performed in several institutes and by various neurosurgeons. These interventions lead to no result, irrespective of the time of the operation or the surgical technique. On the basis of the data of the literature and their material the authors came to the conclusion that since the alteration of the optic nerve has been histologically observed not only in the area of the optic nerve, but also in the free intracranial and intraorbital sector, this was the cause of the failure. The authors' five cases are demonstrated with light and electron microscopic examinations.\n",

      "Chemical injuries of the upper extremity. The prompt recognition and management (Tables 8-1 and 8-2) of chemical burns of the upper extremity may prevent injury to the deep structures of the hand and may make the difference between satisfactory rehabilitation and crippling deformities. Immediate irrigation with water is the single most important treatment that can be carried out, and should be continued for at least an hour and often for several hours, depending on the severity of the injury. Precious time should not be wasted hunting for a specific neutralizing agent. Hydrofluoric acid injuries and phosphorus injuries are the two exceptions to this principle. After copious irrigation and débridement, small superficial burns may be treated without dressings or topical therapy. Large partial-thickness burns are best treated with Sulfamylon burn cream and then with with biologic dressings until healing is achieved. Full-thickness injuries of limited extent should be excised and skin-grafted to regain maximum function, and more extensive burns treated in a nonexicisional regimen.\n",
      "Intraspecific variations in the hemolymph of Biomphalaria glabrata, a snail host of Schistosoma mansoni. An attempt was made to characterize the hemolymph of Biomphalaria glabrata with reference to \"normal\" intra-specific variation, i.e., both inter- and intra-strain differences. Total protein concentration, per cent hemoglobin, pH, and osmolarity were studied. Seven geographic strains of B, glabrata were examined. In addition, observations were made on the hemolymph of Biomphalaria straminea, several strains of Helisoma caribaeum, and on B. glabrata subjected to infection with Schistosoma mansoni or to periods of starvation. Intra-strain differences in total protein concentration and total hemoglobin concentration in B. glabrata appeared to be more closely related with snail size than with absolute age. Inter-strain variation in B. glabrata was also noted, but the differences were of the same magnitude as those from intra-strain samples. Significant differences in total protein concentration were observed, however, between the means of similar size B. glabrata, B. straminea and H. caribaeum. The osmolatity of the hemolymph from different size B. glabrata was similar as were the osmolalities of the hemolymph from similar size snails of different strains. However, all B. glabrata strains exhibited hemolymph osmolalities lower than observed in strains of H. caribaeum. Infection with S. mansoni reduced the protein concentration of B. glabrata hemolymph. Differences were noted as early as 1.5-24 hr post-infection, with significant alterations occurring at about 11 days post-infection. To a lesser extent, starvation also depleted the protein content of the hemolymph.\n",
      "[Relevance of biochemistry in diagnosis and development of alcoholic liver disease (author's transl)]. In a group of 205 patients with alcoholic diseases of liver the diagnostic relevance of biochemical tests (GOT, GPT, AP, GGTP, BSP) was reconsidered with discriminatory process (separation of diagnosis).

At pH less than 3, when regularity of double helices is significantly changed, the formation of the specific compact particles of DNA in PEG-containing solutions does not take place. Denaturation of the compact form of DNA in PEG-containing solution is accompanied by disappearance of the negative band in CD spectrum. Hyperchromic effect of denaturation of DNA compact form is uninformative because of the influence of the light-scattering by compact DNA molecules.\n",
      "[Changes in the chemical composition and physico-chemical characteristics of chromatin from spleens of mice during immunogenesis]. Comparative studies have been carried out for the chemical composition and physico-chemical characteristics of chromatin isolated from spleens of non-immunized and immunized mice. It is found that the chromatin from spleens of immunized mice contains significantly more non-histone proteins and RNA, while the quantity of histone proteins is unaltered. The melting temperatures of chromatin from spleens of non-immunized and immunized mice in 2.5-10(-4) M EDTA (pH 8.0) are 76.8+/-1.50 degrees and 74.4+/-1.10 degrees, respectively. DNA isolated from chromatin melts at 40 degrees. The melting of chromatin was followed in 5 mM sodium-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0)+1.5-10(-4) M EDTA containing increasing concentrations of urea.

      "Correction of severe combined immunodeficiency by fetal liver cells. As an alternative to bone-marrow transplantation, two infants with severe combined immunodeficiency who had no histocompatible donors were given intraperitoneal infusions of fresh liver cells from fetuses of eight and nine to 10 weeks. Transient graft-versus-host disease began at 42 and 52 days, respectively. Both infants had rises in T cells and declines in B cells by three months. No functional immunologic improvement occurred in the first infant, who died of pulmonary disease 10 months later. Clinical and functional immunologic improvement occurred in the other, who is now 19 months after transplantation. Lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were noted by three months, to concanavalin A by five months, and to allogeneic cells by eight months. Delayed cutaneous responsiveness to candida developed and IgM became norma. IgA and IgG remained low. Chimerism was demonstrated by a donor marker chromosome in metaphases from recipient lymphocytes. Fetal liver cells therefore reversed the immunodeficiency.\n",
      "[Kinetics and mechanism of the 3H to 1H in C(8)H groups of purine derivatives]. The pH-dependence of the 3H to 1H exchange between water and C(8)H groups of purine, adenine, 9-methyladenine, 7-methyladenine, hypoxanthine, guanine, xanthine as well as C(2)H groups of imidazole and benzimidazole was studied. It was shown  that within the pH-ranges, where the majority of molecules under study are non-ionized, the values of observed rate constant (kobs) do not depend on pH. Beyond these ranges the values of k(obs) are increased or decreased depending on the type of ionizaiton of the compound under study in appropriate pH range. The observed pH dependence of the 3H to 1H exchange is in a good quantitative agreement with ylide mechanism of the exchange reaction. According to this mechanism the 3H--1H exchange takes place in N(7)-protonated forms of the purine derivatives and in zwitterions with positive charge on N(7). The ylide mechanism of the exchange reaction is also suggested by the fact that the true exchange rate constants (k+) of protonated forms of the studied compounds, calculated from the values of k(ods), rises linearly with the increase of their protonation constant (Ka1)--the tenfold increase of Ka1 leads to about four-fold rise of k+. The knowledge of 1h to 3H exchange mechanism in C(8)H groups of purine derivatives allows to estimate alterations of reactivity of the purine residues in polynucleotides and nucleic acids depending on their conformation.\n",

      "Impaired urinary acidification in the hypothyroid rat. Since abnormalities in the renal handling of sodium and water in both the proximal and distal tubule have been described in primary hypothyroidism, this study was undertaken to examine renal tubular hydrogen secretion in this disorder. Metabolic acidosis was induced in hypothyroid rats (H) and their age matched controls (C) by the administration of an oral ammonium chloride load of 0.15 g/24 h/kg for three days. On day 3 animals were prepared for clearance and acid-base studies, receiving an infusion of Ringer's solution of 0.6 ml/hr/100 g during surgery and the experimental procedure. A 26% decrease in GFR (P less than 0.005) and a doubling in fractional excretion of sodium (P less than 0.02) were observed in H rats. The lowest blood pH and average bicarbonate concentration and the excretion of chloride were similar in the two groups, indicating that the acid load was reabsorbed and led to similar degrees of systemic acidification. Urine flow also was comparable in the two groups. Minimal urine pH after NH4Cl was 6.21 +/- 0.06 in H and 5.68 +/- 0.09 in C (P less than 0.001). Ammonium excretion was 28% (P less than 0.05) lower in H than in C. The defect in urine acidification in H was only partially corrected after 5 days on a low sodium diet and DOCA administration for 2 days. Fractional bicarbonate excretion at normal blood pH and bicarbonate concentration was not different in the two groups. These data indicate that hypothyroid rats have a mild defect in urine acidification and that it is localized predominantly in the distal tubule.\n",

      "Electrical responses of isolated Nitella protoplasm--excitations or artifacts? Isolated protoplasmic droplets of the alga Nitella were investigated with microelectrodes under current clamp conditions. The following observations were made: 1. Long pulses of either polarity yielded almost symmetric current-voltage relations. Near the rather small resting potential (inside negative) the measuring points lay on a straight line corresponding to an apparent surface membrane resistance of 1.7 +/- 0.45 komega (mean +/- S.E.M., n=5). 2. Experiments with various pulse programs revealed no mechanism comparable to Na inactivation but stressed the electrical symmetry of the droplet with respect to the resting potential. 3. Changes of the [Ca2+] in the bathing medium between 0 to 10 mM as well as of the pH between 5 and 9 did not influence the responses. Replacing K+ by Na+ (or vice versa) or exchanging NO3 for acetylglycine or Cl- was also ineffective. These observations are not consistent with a normal excitable surface membrane. Similar responses are obtained with a RC network which is described and which may have its substrate in histological peculiarities of the protoplasmic droplet.\n",
      "The action of Ca2+ , Mg2+ and H+ on the contraction threshold of frog skeletal muscle: Evidence for surface charges controlling electro-mechanical coupling. The dependence of the threshold potential for contraction of pH and the concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the bathing solution was measured in frog skeletal muscle. Decreasing the pH from 10.3 to 4.65 resulted in a threshold shift to more positive potentials. Between pH 6.5 and 8.5 the concentration threshold was almost pH -independent. Increasing [Ca2+]o (in the concentration range 0.5-50 mM) shifted the curves relating contraction threshold to pH to less negative potentials and diminished the overall pH-dependence. The contraction threshold exhibited a similar dependence on [Ca2+]o and [Mg2+]o, the two curves running parallel in the concentration range of 5-50 mM, but Mg2+ was only c. 0.6 as effective as Ca2+. To explain these results a surface charge model is proposed which assumes that two acidic groups, sigma1 and sigma2, and one basic group, sigma3, reside at the outer surface of the membrane of the T-system. Alterations in the extracellular medium exert their influence on the electro-mechanical coupling process by changing the surface potential. The groups will be titrated by protons and their charges screened off by the divalent cations. In addition, Ca2+ was supposed to bind with a weak dissociation constant (23 M) to the two acidic groups. The chosen charge densities are: sigma1 = -0.0085/A2 [= -1e/(10.8 A)2], sigma2 = -0.0037/A2 [= -1e/(16.4 A)2], sigma3 = 0.0028/A2 [= + 1e/(18.9 A)2] with intrinsic dissociation constants KH1 = 10(-2.0)M, KH2 = 10(-4.1)M, and KH3 = 10(-8.5) M.

      "[Comparison of the pA2 of various beta blocking agents]. The drug industry is now putting out specific beta 1 or beta 2 beta-blocking agents. The pA2 of various beta-blocking agents were determined on isolated organs-guinea pig atrium and trachea: practolol and acebutolol were considered as specific beta-1 inhibitors; butoxamine was a specific beta-2 inhibitor, while pindolol, oxprenolol, propranolol and alprenolol were specificity free. The pA2 quantifies the action exerted by an inhibitor. Cardioselectivity is expressed by the pA2 left atrium/pA2 trachea ratio. It exceeds 1 000 for practolol, it equals 30 for acebutolol, and is very slight for butoxamine. The pA2 therefore gives a good idea of the potential of the various drugs on the animal's isolated organ. However, these data cannot safely be extrapolated to man. Hence the necessity of conducting clinical pharmacological studies.\n",
      "[Effects of adrenergic blockade on adipose tissue lipolysis provoked in cats and humans by intravenous perfusion of isoprenaline]. An intravenous infusion of isoprenaline (1 mug/kg/mn during 4 h) elicited a rise in serum free fatty acids (FFA) and glucose in anaesthetised cats. The effect reached a peak in 1 h and was then maintained at a plateau level for the remainder of the infusion. Acebutolol and practolol (0,1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) were more potent in reducing the concentration of free fatty acids (FFA) than in lowering glucose. Propranolol was roughly equipotent on FFA and glucose. In 6 fasted human volunteers, an intravenous infusion of isoprenaline (0,03 mug/kg/mn during 15 min) stimulated a rise in serum FFA. Peak values were attained rapidly and FFA levels began to fall soon after the end of the infusion. Blood glucose concentration was not changed. A placebo, given after the first infusion of isoprenaline, did not significantly affect the response to 2 further infusions at 2 and 4 h later. An oral dose of acebutolol (300 mg) largely suppressed the lipolytic effect of the 2nd and 3rd isoprenaline infusions, the degrees of inhibition being 70 p.cent and 85 p.cent respectively. The same dose of practolol was considerably less effective in inhibiting lipolysis (37 p.cent and 25 p.cent inhibition).\n",

The effect of these agents was found to be dose-dependent and, in the case of the catecholamines, saturable. NGF was active at concentrations as low as 10(-8) M. Oxidized NGF was only minimally active, and insulin was completely inactive. Neither dopamine nor phenylephrine had activity. Inhibition of cyclase by either isoproterenol or epinephrine was blocked by I-propranolol, a specific beta-antagonist, but propranolol by itself had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. The data indicate that the secretory vesicle membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors coupled to the adenylate cyclase. Propranolol was also found to block the NGF-induced inhibition of cyclase. We conclude that the granule membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors as well as NGF-reactive sites, and that the two may be functionally linked.\n",
      "Preliminary characterization of the acrasin of the cellular slime mold Polysphondylium violaceum. Some species of cellular slime mold do not respond to cyclic AMP as an acrasin, or chemoattractant. In one such species, Polysphondylium violaceum, we have isolated and purified its acrasin and determined some of its chemical properties, which lead us to believe it is a small molecule of less than 1500 daltons. One possibility is that it might be a peptide. The acrasin specifically attracts the amoebae of P. violaceum and P. pallidum and fails to do so for six species of Dictyostelium tested. We also have evidence for a specific acrasinase that inactivates the Polysphondylium acrasin.\n",
      "[The effect of hydrocortisone and insulin on the activity and isoenzymes of typrosine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase in the ctyostructures of the livers of rats of different ages]. Administration of hydrocortisone or insulin and also a simultaneous use of these hormones in a high dose caused a marked elevation of the total activity of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase and its anode and cathode isoenzymes in the soluble fraction of the liver in the sexually immature (weighing 100-110 g) and mature (weighing 180-200 g) male rats. The stimulating effect of insulin was sharper in the young in comparison with adult animals. Administration of hydrocortisone caused a more pronounced elevation of the total tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase activity in the hepatic mitochondria of young rats than in adult animals. Insulin administration increased the activity of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase in the mitochondria of the liver of the sexually mature male rats without significant changes of this enzyme in the sexually imature rats. A simultaneous injection of hydrocortisone and insulin to the sexaully mature male rats caused the same increase in the tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase activity in the hepatic mitochondria as after the administration of glucocorticosteriod alone. As to the sexaully immature males, the activity of the enzyme fell to the normal level. It is supposed that androgens played a significant role in the realization of the inducing action of glucocorticoids and insulin influencing the synthesis of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase in different directions in the mitochondria of the liver of young and sexually mature animals.\n",
      "Effects of dietary vitamin D and calcium on lysyl oxidase activity in chick bone metaphyses. Activity of lysyl oxidase, an enzyme responsible for production of aldehydic precursors for lysine-derived collagen crosslinks, was measured in tibial metaphyses from chicks receiving different dietary levels of vitamin D and Ca for 2 weeks after hatching. Enzyme activities were increased twofold in D-deficient chicks compared to activities from chicks receiving control levels of vitamin D. Addition of Ca to the D-deficient diet had no effect on lysyl oxidase activity. It is suggested that vitamin D may play a role in the age-related decrease in lysyl oxidase activity that normally occurs in chick bone.\n",
      "Factors influencing nonspecific binding of glucocorticoids in myocardial tissue. Myocardial slices from the left ventricle of cat hearts were incubated in Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 10 mM glucose which were gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Tritiated dexamethasone (DEXA 0.171 MM) or methylprednisolone (MP 0.805 mM) was added under varying conditions of temperature, pH, and in the presence of various metabolic inhibitors. Glucocorticoid uptake by myocardial tissue was found to be temperature-dependent, plateauting after 60 min of incubation at 0.21 mumole of DEXA/g of tissue and 0.95 mumole of MP/g of tissue at 37 degrees. Steroid uptake was retarded about 50% at 0 degrees. Increasing the concentration of either steroid resulted in a linear increase in the uptake of that steroid. Incubation in the presence of metabolic or SH-inhibitors produced no significant changes in glucocorticoid uptake. Optimal glucocorticoid uptake occurred between pH 7.3-7.4. Thus, myocardial cells appear to be able to take up large quantities of glucocorticoids, but the uptake process does not appear to be energy-dependent.\n",
      "Arylamidase and cathepsin-A activity of normal and dystrophic human muscle. Human skeletal muscle homogenate has been shown to contain enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of L-leucyl p-nitroanilide and carbobenzoxyglutamyl-L-tyrosine, known substrates, respectively, for arylamidase and cathepsin A. The muscle arylamidase was found to be inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Addition of Co2+ resulted in slight stimulation of its activity. Neither ethylenediamine tetraacetate nor thiol compounds had any appreciable effect on the enzyme. When compared to controls, no significant differences in muscle arylamidase levels were observed in patients with muscular dystrophies and certain selected neuromuscular diseases. Cathepsin A was, however, increased in muscles moderately affected by muscular dystrophy and denervating diseases.\n",
      "Synthesis of some new phenothiazine derivatives of expected medicinal value. 2-Chloroacetyl phenothiazines were reacted with certain phenols and salts of some acids under different conditions to yield 2-substituted acetylphenothiazines. Another series of 10-substituted phenothiazines was synthesized by treatment of 10-chloroacetylphenothiazine with either the appropriate amines or salts of the respective acids. The optimum experimental conditions for the preparation of 2-chloroacetyl-10-acetyl-phenothiazine by Friedel-Crafts reaction were studied. Also N-chloroacetyl-o-aminophenol was synthesized in high yield by a simple method. The preliminary pharmacological screening showed that two of these compounds possess a low order of tranquillizing activity.\n",
      "Morphological changes in the thymus of young and adult red-billed queleas Quelea quelea (aves). In a wild population of red-billed queleas Quelea quelea L. (Ploceidae: weaver-birds) sampled throughout the year in East Africa, the thymus was found to enlarge in young birds shortly after hatching, remain enlarged during the juvenile stage, and regress towards the end of the postjuvenile moult. In adults, recrudescence occurred in many individuals during the prenuptial and postnuptial moults, and also in most if not all individuals, of both sexes, for a brief period during a breeding session. Thymus enlargement in both young and adults has been found to be accompanied by marked erythropoietic activity within the gland, and it is suggested that this activity is related to an increased demand for erythrocytes which may occur during moult and breeding.\n",
      "Histological changes associated with enlargement and regression of the thymus glands of the red-billed quelea Quelea quelea L. (Ploceidae: weaver-birds). Thymic lobes form over 200 red-billed queleas, Quelea quelea L., were examined histologically. Samples were taken from embryos about to hatch, juveniles and adults. The lobes varied in size from very small to very enlarged (1- greater than 5 mm long). The constituent cell types are described in detail and the occurrence of these cells in different sized lobes is discussed. A cycle of events is proposed which accounts for the observations presented here. It is suggested that the large numbers of erythroid cells found in the cortex of some individuals were developing in situ. The significance of erythropoiesis within the thymus is discussed.\n",
      "EMMA-4 analysis of iron in cells of the thymic cortex of a weaver-bird (Quelea quelea). Combined morphological and analytical studies with the EMMA-4 analytical electron microscope have enabled very early erythroid cells to be identified within the cortex of enlarging thymic lobes of Quelea quelea. These early erythroid cells have pale cytoplasm (sometimes with ferritin-like crystals present), slightly pachychromatic nuclei and have fewer cell organelles (mitochondria) than lymphocytes. Counts for iron were approximately 70% lower than counts from mature erythrocytes found free in the cortex. Iron was also recorded from some epithelial reticular cells and pyknotic nuclei; no iron was recorded from small lymphocytes (thymocytes) in the cortex. The presence of very early erythroid cells is a further indication that erythropoiesis occurs in situ in the avian thymus.\n",
      "The postcranial skeletons of the Triassic mammals Eozostrodon, Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium. The purposes of this monograph are to describe the postcranial skeletons of the earliest known mammals, and to probe, in so far as possible by osteological study, biological questions concerning the habits and adaptations of these late Triassic forms. In this context, information on the background of this investigation is useful. Studies of Mesozoic mammals, begun some 150 years ago, are based on rare and fragmentary fossils, principally jaws and teeth. These investigations have yielded a bare outline of some 120 million years of mammalian evolution-about two-thirds of mammalian history. No assessment of the important biological changes occurring during this time can ever be complete, but major advances are possible as new discoveries provide material that is more complete or that represents a previously unknown evolutionary stage. So tenuous is the evidence that at least some concepts are re-evaluated with each discovery. Postcranial anatomy offers especially intriguing prospects for investigation because associated material (that can be positively assigned to a taxon below subclass) has been for the most part unknown, and indeed even dissociated bones are a rarity. Since G.G. Simpson's monographs of 1928 and 1929, progress in the study of Mesozoic mammals has been largely dependent on new finds. A major impetus to renewed investigation came from the discoveries of Mesozoic mammals by Walter Kühne in 1939 and during the immediate post-war years. Kühne first worked on fissures in the Carboniferous limestone quarries at Frome, Somerset, in southwest England where he collected a series of teeth of the problematical form Haramiya and two triconodont teeth which were placed in the genus Eozostrodon (Parrington 1941, 1946). The fissure faunas are generally thought to be of Upper Triassic (Rhaetic) age (Kühne 1946), although Kermack, Musset &amp; Rigney (1973) believe that the evidence is insufficient to determine whether the deposits are Rhaetic or Lower Liassic. After the war Kühne carried his explorations farther west, eventually reaching the quarries at Bridgend in Glamorgan, Wales, where he not only found more triconodont teeth in some quantity (Kühne 1958) but also a symmetrodont tooth (Kühne 1950). Shortly after making these discoveries, Kühne returned to Germany and the work was continued by a team from University College, London, under the leadership of Dr K.A. Kermack.\n",
      "Classical conditioning in the sea anemone, Cribrina xanthogrammica. Earlier attempts to classically condition sea anemones have yielded inconclusive results. Using light as CS and shock as US, conditioning as distinguished from sensitization and pseudoconditioning was demonstrated in anemones. Procedural controls included substitution of light alone, shock alone, and random light and shock in place of paired light-shock trials. Responses measured were electrical output and folding of the oral disc. The conditioned response was distinguished from the unconditioned response to light and the unconditioned response to shock in terms of response latency of both electrical and behavioral measures.\n",
      "Performance enhancement effects of d-amphetamine, methylphenidate, pipradrol and phenindamine in rats. A multiple behavioral schedule with food reinforcement was designed to measure the drug-induced performance enhancement and non-effective activity in rats. The schedule, 20 min in duration, had CRF components in the 33 trials and extinction components in the inter-trial periods. During each trial, food reinforcement was present in the limited period (8 sec each) which was preceded by a discriminative stimulus (1 sec, either a light or a footshock). The rats generated a high rate of lever pressing during the limited period and a low rate of lever pressing during the inter-trial period. The drugs studied were d-amphetamine, methylphenidate, pipradrol and phenindamine. At low dosages, these drugs increased further the high rate of lever pressing. This was considered to be the performance enhancement effect. At higher doses, the drugs increased the low rate of lever pressing, decreased the high rate of lever pressing, and decreased responding of the rats to the discriminative stimulus. This latter pattern was considered to be the non-effective activity caused by the drugs. As expected, d-amphetamine was the most potent. Minor differences in drug effects were seen between the group of rats having light and that group having footshock as discriminative stimulus.\n",
      "[Automatic method for determination of serum antistreptolysin]. The AA. describe a method of determination of serum antistreptolysin employing \"Technicon\" AutoAnalyzer, this method permitting the execution of 40 determinations in an hour, with a time of analysis of about 16 minutes. The procedure of analysis is very easy, with a very high selectivity of values; a variation coefficient of 5,3% and an accuracy index of 4,4% were found. Since the amount of serum employed is 50 mul this method appears to be particularly suitable in paediatry and in serological screening.\n",
      "On the influence of prostaglandin F2alpha-induced labor at term on the metabolism and coagulation of mother and fetus. 11 pregnancies at term were terminated by dilatation of the uterine cervix, low amniotomy, and by intravenous administration of PGF2alpha. The average infusion time was 3 hours 55 minutes, and the average total dose of PGF2alpha amounted to 2.0 mg. Parameters of acid-base changes, carbohydrate and energic state changes, gas metabolism, and changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis in mother and in fetus were analyzed during labor and after birth. Labor activity and fetal cardiac action were monitored cardiotocographically. Checked against 50 uncomplicated spontaneous deliveries, we found no disadvantageous changes in the parameters investigated.\n",
      "Pulmonary microembolism: attenuated pulmonary vasoconstriction with prostaglandin inhibitors and antihistamines. The mechanism(s) involved in the pulmonary vascular and airway responses to pulmonary microembolism have not been clearly defined. Therefore, we determined the effects of specific prostaglandin and histamine blockade on the hemodynamic and arterial blood gas tension responses to particulate microembolism (200 mu glass beads) in intact anesthetized dogs. The marked increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance observed in the untreated dogs were attenuated, but not abolished, following both prostaglandin blockade (with either meclofenamate or polyphloretin phosphate) and histamine blockade (with chlorpheniramine and metiamide) at 5 minutes, and were still attenuated 30 minutes post embolization. Combined prostaglandin and histamine blockade further attenuated, but again did not abolish, the pulmonary vascular responses. Cardiac outputs and systemic arterial pressures were unchanged from control by embolism. The alveolar hypoventilation (decreased arterial oxygen tension and increased carbon dioxide tension) observed in the untreated embolized dogs was prevented only with the prostaglandin inhibitors. Pulmonary microembolism in intact dogs, therefore, appears to induce vasoconstriction mediated partially by prostaglandin and histamine action, and alveolar hypoventilation mediated by prostaglandin, but not histamine, action.\n",
      "Carotid body control of coronary flow, myocardial oxidative metabolism, and cardiac catecholamines in the dog. In a series of 11 dogs, selective stimulation of the carotid body receptors by hypoxic, hypercapnic, acidotic blood produces bradycardia, an increase of coronary flow, and greater release of norepinephrine from the heart; the coronary resistances are decreased. The same stimulation after vagotomy is no longer accompanied by bradycardia; the decrease of coronary resistance is less marked and the release of norephinephrine is increased.\n",
      "Noradrenergic subsensitivity of rat liver homogenates during chronic ethanol ingestion. Prior studies indicated that chronic ethanol feeding induced noradrenergic subsensitivity of the cerebral cortex. Sensitivity was measured using the cAMP response of brain slices to norepinephrine (NE). In the present report we investigated the possibility that noradrenergic receptors in a visceral organ might be similarly affected by ethanol feeding. The cAMP response of liver homogenates to NE was measured. Chronic ethanol ingestion induced subsensitivity of the liver to NE similar to that observed in the brain. The ED50 was shifted to the right from 2.1 X 10(-5) M to 1.3 X 10(-4) M NE. By 3 days of ethanol withdrawal the cAMP response returned to control levels.\n",
      "Interactions between drugs and saliva-stimulating parafilm and their implications in measurements of saliva drug levels. The interaction between Parafilm and four tranquilizers in their neutral phosphate buffer solutions resulted in various degrees of loss of the drugs from the solutions. The values of loss ranged from 15 to 34% for chlorpromazine and 8 to 42% for butaperazine at the initial concentration range of 2 to 20 mug/ml at room temperature (22 +/- 1 degree C). Under the same conditions, the values of loss from saliva for these two drugs were fairly constant; about 25% and 17%, respectively. For diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, the losses from the buffer solution were below 5%.\n",

      "N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase system in synovial fluid. The present study was undertaken with the object of examining the N-Acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase activity in joint effusions from non-inflammatory (osteoarthrosis) and inflammatory (rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis and chondrocalcinosis) joint diseases. The biochemical properties of four purified molecular forms were investigated. They were separated on the basis of their net charge, using DEAE-cellulose anion-exchangers. In the order of their outcome from the anion exchanger the four enzymes (B, I1, I2 and A) were found to have pH optima at 4.5-4.75, 4.20, 4.00 and 4.75, respectively. The first three enzymes proved to be heat-stable and the fourth enzyme fraction was a heat-labile form. By means of gel-filtration techniques, the enzymes were eluted into two fractions. The first contained the thermolabile A form and the molecular weight of this enzyme was estimated at 162000. The second fraction included the three thermostable enzymes. Their molecular weight was estimated at 135000. As described by Ikonne &amp; Ellis (6) the hexosaminidase A from sera was less tightly held by the anion-exchanger than was the hexosaminidase A from tissues (polymorphonuclear cells, synovial membrane tissue, cartilage). Thus the serum type (As) must be distinct from the tissue type (At). The activity of the tissue type probably originating from the leukocytes and from the synovial membrane was more pronounced in the synovial effusions of the patients with inflammatory joint diseases. The hexosaminidase A fraction from synovial fluids of patients with osteoarthrosis contained only the serum type of enzyme.\n",
      "[Gastroenterology yesterday and today]. In the 40 years since the foundation of the \"Schweizerische Gesellschaft fur Gastroenterologie\", medicine - and with it gastroenterology - have markedly changed. New diseases and syndromes have been discovered and others have disappeared. New knowledge in basic sciences influences progress in diagnosis and therapy. In diagnostic methods the most evident advances are fiberendoscopy, endophotography and biopsy, and progress in roentgenology and immunology. New drugs, new surgical methods and controlled trials have improved treatment. However, each advance has its drawbacks: the growing incidence of iatrogenic diseases, the overwhelming literature, the flood of congresses, the record-breaking mentality of many clinicians and the hunting and collecting instinct for \"interesting cases\". \"Medical art\", a notion difficult to define, is in danger of disappearing. It means a harmony of knowledge, skill experience, intuition and the predominant desire to help the patient. This means individualized medicine, which is only possible by sympathetic dialogue with the patient - not only by specialists in psychiatry or psychosomatics, but by every doctor. will be able to preserve medicine from inhumanity in spite of technology, rationalization and the computer?\n",
      "Sperm diaphorase: genetic polymorphism of a sperm-specific enzyme in man. Human sperm contains en enzyme with diaphorase activity that appears to be unique to sperm. Electrophoretic analysis of the diaphorase activity in sperm of different individuals reveals three phenotypic patterns. This polymorphism can be explained in terms of two alleles segregating at an autosomal locus; the allele frequencies have been determined to be 0.71 and 0.29. This appears to be the first reported example of a sperm-specific genetic polymorphism in man; its existence raises a number of genetic and biochemical questions.\n",

      "[Changes of protein metabolism following irradiation. II. Protease activity, protease pattern, protein and free amino acids in the cytoplasm and cell organelles of the rat liver following 600 R whole-body irradiation]. The protease activity of cytoplasm and cell organelles of the rat liver against liver protein and hemoglobin as a substrate increases during an initial reaction phase on the first day after 600 R whole body X-irradiation. This is probably a consequence of the degradation of cellular debris. The protein, the protease activity and the free amino acids of the cytoplasm and the cell organelles decrease during the disease phase on day 3 and 4 after irradiation. The protein loss of the liver is therefore not explained by an increased protease activity. The protease activity and the free amino acids are increased in the cytoplasm and the cell organelles during the regeneration phase of the organism between day 15 and 18 after irradiation.\n",
      "Dynamics of the changes in the tissular levels of cyclic AMP after cobalt-60 gamma-irradiation. The total amounts of cyclic AMP in liver, brain and intestinal mucosa have been measured in rats, at constant intervals, up to 18 days after whole body exposure to either a unique moderate dose (500 rd) or a unique lethal dose (750 rd) of cobalt-60 gamma-radiation. This radiation, even in a lethal dose, was found to induce no significant changes in the hepatic levels of cAMP. In contrast, an abrupt short-lasting increase in the levels of cAMP was observed in brain and intestinal mucosa after a 500-rd-irradiation, and a progressive long-lasting increase in its levels in the intestinal mucosa and, especially, in the brain was found after a 750-rd-irradiation. It is concluded that these organs contain different cAMP systems, which would explain, at least in part, their dissimilar responses to the ionizing rays.\n",
      "Changes in the composition of milk and rumen contents in cows exposed to a high ambient temperature with controlled feeding. Two pairs of Jersey cows were exposed to either 15 or 30 degrees C air temperature; intake of dried grass was controlled, to be equal at both temperatures. Exposure to 30 degrees C caused increases in rectal temperature and in respiratory rates, and decreases infood intakes in both cows. Milk yield decreased by similar amounts at both temperatures, in association with the decreases in food intakes. The fat and protein content of milk decreased significantly at 30 degrees C; the proportion of shorter chain fatty acids (C6-C14) IN THE milk fat also decreased at 30 degrees C. The proportion of acetic acid in the rumen contents decreased significantly at 30 degrees C, in association with a small decrease in pH. The results indicate that changes in the metabolism of cows occurred at 30 degrees C, independently of changes in food intake.\n",

Arteriolar diameters and venular erythrocyte velocities in the small pial vessels on the surface of the cat brain were measured by TV methods during induced epileptic seizures through a cranial window. Grand mal seizures maximally dilated arterioles and increased venular erythrocyte velocity up to 400%. High positive correlation existed between changes in CSF hydrogen ion concentration and pial arteriolar diameter, suggesting metabolic regulation of CBF through CSF/interstitial fluid hydrogen ion alterations during the seizure.\n",
      "[Characteristics of heterogeneity of serum albumin in heterosis-hybrid chickens]. A comparative study was performed for isoelectric and electrophoretic spectra blood serum albumin of parental breeds of chickens and their heterosis hybrids --broiler cocks. The method of isoelectric focusing within the surcrose density gradient and pH 4-6 created by the gradient of sucrose, mannitol and boron-borate buffer (pH 8.5) concentrations was applied. The electrophoretic spectrum of the serum albumin fraction homogeneous in the agar gel was obtained by electrophoresis in 7% polyacrylamide gel. The isoelectric spectrum of heterosis hybrid albumin is established to be more heterogeneous and during isoelectric focusing it is divided within a range of pH 4.6-5.2 into seven fractions against four-five components of the parent breed albumin. Among them it is possible to distinguish the fraction involving more than 50% of the total protein (the great component) and some small components with different protein content and belonging wither to a more acid or more basic region as compared to pI of the great component. The pI value of the great component for hybrid albumin is shifted towards the acid region (4.76 against 4.85 and 5.07 in albumin of the parent breeds). Small component of hybrid albumin are characterized by an increase in their amount, but pI of the fraction is within the range of values peculiar to albumin of the maternal and paternal lines. The albumin preparations of all the studied chicken breeds isolated from blood serum by electrophoresis in the agar gel manifest multiplicity of the protein bands in a 7% polyacrylamide gel. The electric spectra of hybrid albumin and parent breeds albumin differ in the distribution pattern of the components and their quantitative composition. A relative electrophoretic mobility of the intensively stained dense band which represents the main electrophoretic component is increased in hydrid albumin with the respect to albumin of the maternal line but is identical to the paternal line.\n",

      "[Peculiarities of acid-base reserves in aging]. The age-dependent peculiarities of the acid-base balance at rest and with standard loads were studied in 466 rats. It was found that with age the pH value of blood decreases, the tension of the carbonic acid increases, but the values of BB, BE, SB, and AB do not undergo any significant changes. With loads, old animals showed more profound changes in the system and these changes were of decompensated character. The maximal changes in young animals were registered 1.5 hours after loading, in old rats--3 hours after. The normalization of the shifts in old rats occurred much more slowly than in young animals, and it does not reached the initial value by 24 hours after loading. The analysis of the data obtained shows that with aging the reserve potentialities of the organism's mechanisms of the acid-base balance regulation greatly decrease, which under certain conditions results in disturbance of the given system compensation, thus exerting a negative effect on the body vital processes.\n",
      "[Dynamics of production and various properties of interferon-like inhibitors formed under the influence of AET and cystaphos in vivo and in cell cultures]. Interferon-like virus inhibitors appeared in the blood serum of animals and in the culture fluid 15 min.--1 hour and 4-6 hours after administration of AET (S, beta-amino-ethylisotiuronium) and cystaphos (monosodium salt of beta-aminoethylthiophosphorus acid). These inhibitors showed species-specificity, were inactivated by trypsin and by heating at 37 degrees C for 2 hours and at 56 degrees C for 1 hour, did not sediment at 100,000 g. It is assumed that these are two different inhibitors of which the one forming the early peak pre-exists in the cell. It is probably associated with cell membranes and is released as a result of chemical effect of aminothyols. The late peak of inhibitor is synthesized de novo as inducated by its sensitivity to the effect of puromycin and cycloheximide.\n",
      "[Lipolysis in human adipose tissue (author's transl)]. Lipolytic activity was measured under different conditions in isolated fat cells and homogenates of human adipose tissue of the greater omentum. It was demonstrated that lipolysis took place in isolated fat cells at an optimum pH of 7.4 and was markedly stimulated by noradrenaline, but not by blood serum. By contrast lipolysis was significantly stimulated by blood serum, but not by noradrenaline, in homogenates of adipose tissue. Serum-stimulated lipolysis exhibited optimum activity at pH 8 and was inhibited by 1M sodium chloride. It is concluded that lipolytic activity in isolated fat cells can mainly be ascribed to the action of hormone-sensitive lipase, whereas lipolysis in homogenates of adipose tissue in the presence of serum is mostly regulated by lipoprotein lipase.\n",

The intravenous administration of 2.5 mg Kö 1366 resulted in a rapid and statistically significant (p less than 0.001) marked decrease in heart rate due to the beta-sympatholytic effect. Airway resistance, however, measured by whole-body plethysmography, was not affected. Kö 1366 can be regarded as a cardio-selective beta-sympatholytic drug in so far as i.v. administration is possible in patients with airway disease during a non-obstructive period. Moreover, should a bronchospastic reaction occur immediate control by inhalation of adrenergic or vagolytic drugs is possible.\n",
      "[Cerebral manifestations in the hepatic coma syndrome (author's transl)]. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has been investigated in a two-stage devascularization model in the rat with portavacal shunt and hepatic artery ligation. There is a significant increase in brain octopamine and phenylethanolamine and a decrease in brain norepinephrine (NE) 6 to 9 hours after hepatic artery ligation. The depletion of NE seems the sequel of diminished synthesis in the presence of an unaltered turnover rate, due to a blockade of tyrosine hydroxylase either by accumulation of false neurochemical transmitters or by phenylalanine. It is most marked in the cortex and midbrain. The high-energy phosphate compounds, ATP, phosphocreatine and glucose-6-phosphate are not diminished in hepatic coma, nor is glucose, indicating that other mechanism are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic state by the increased ammonia level. \"intestinal sterilization\" and total colectomy have no significant effect on the ammonia level, but cause a decrease in the level or aromatic precursor amino acids in the plasma and brain, with normalization of the level of cerebral transmitters. These results permit the formulation of a unified concept of the hepatic coma syndrome and its clinical manifestations such as flapping tremor, the hyperdynamic cardiovascular state and the hepatorenal syndrome. Moreover, they form the basis for the introduction of a new therapeutic principle in the management of hepatic encephalopathy by L-dopa or modified amino acid solutions, which act by altering the central and peripheral neurotransmitters.\n",
      "[Urinary enzymes in the early detection of rejection reactions after renal transplantation (author's transl)]. Urinary enzymes were studied in 15 patients subjected to kidney transplantation. The investigation was initiated immediately after operation and was continued for a period of between 2 and 8 weeks. There was a significant increase in urinary MDH activity in 94.2% of cases, of LDH activity in 95,65% and of gamma-GT activity in 95,17% of the cases. This detected increase in urinary enzyme activities preceded the clinical diagnosis of rejection by activities preceded the clinical diagnosis of rejection by at least 24 hours.

      "[Inducible accumulation of alpha-ketoglutaric acid in cultures of Streptomyces hygroscopicus JA 6599 producing a macrolide antibiotic]. The excessive production of pyruvic and 2-oxoglutaric acid by S. hygroscopicus JA 6599 grown on a medium rich in complex carbon and nitrogen sources was studied. Towards the end of the first day of batch cultivation a maximum level of both keto acids in the medium was observed. By diluting the complete culture with water at 22nd hour, however, a further increase in 2-oxoglutarate concentration was induced and the antibiotic production was slightly stimulated. In diluted cultures the oxygen saturation was found to be distinctly higher than in non-diluted ones and, on the other hand, the mycelial activities of both pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylases were decreased. Since the 2-oxoglutarate level was strongly influenced by inhibitors of glycolysis and of citric acid cycle, it is suggested that the metabolite accumulation in diluted cultures is mainly caused by modifications of the metabolic control of carbohydrate catabolism due to an improved aeration. Furthermore, the macrolide antibiotic A 6599 produced by S. hygroscopicus JA 6599 itself was shown to interfere with the accumulation of 2-oxoglutaric acid.\n",

Beside of maternal shock (traumatic, hoaemorrhagic, supine hypotension syndrome) all acute distress situation are seen during labour.

There are the change of position in bed, infusion of low molecular dextrane, O2- breathing, buffering of the mother, infusion of vasodilatators and beta-stimulators to the mother. The main therapeutical principle for intrauterine reanimation are change of side position and beta-stimulator therapy in case of disturbances in feto-maternal respiration because of an acute utero-placental insufficiency or a cord complication. As to an own patient group with intrauterine reanimation with the beta-stimulator \"Partusisten\" in 174 deliveries with cardiotocographic signs of fetal distress in the first stage of labour there is shown that threatened fetal distress because of uterine hyperactivity and cord complication is successfully treated by tocolysis.

      "[Studies on the hatching of miracidia of Dicrocoelium dendriticum (author's transl)]. The eggs of Dicrocoelium dendriticum were induced to open by solutions of formic acid and caproic acid (Table 1). The miracidia hatched in O2-free water after the eggs had been dried with N2 or in vacuum. The miracidia were able to live for 3 hours if water contained 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, and 1 mM CaCl2. Ca++-ions are obviously necessary for the mobility of miracidia. The experimental use of intestinal juice of the Roman snail Helix pomatia gave hatching results which were dependent on the absence of O2 (exposure to N2) and the presence of bacteria with a still unknown function. The dependence on pH seems to be indirect (Abb. 2). Studies on the permeabilities of the egg shell and the embryonic membrane (\"vitelline membrane\"), the evidence of an oligosaccharide (Abb. 3) liberated from the \"spaltraum\" (Abb. 1) during egg-opening, and the determination of the osmotic pressure of the hatching process (50% hatching in 1.2--14. Osmols sucrose/1000 ml H2O; Abb. 4) led to the following hypothesis of hatching mechanism: After the activation of the granular gland of the miracidium an enzyme is released into the extra-embryonic \"spaltraum\". A polysaccharide is digested to an oligosaccharide which cannot permeate the egg shell and the embryonic membrane. The rising osmotic pressure bursts off the operculum.\n",

Benorylate is particularly qualified for treatment of a beginning rheumatoid arthritis and for diseases with a low inflammatory activity. For patients with high inflammatory activity treatment with this substance alone is not sufficient. Side effects are mainly subjective troubles. Severe side effects were not observed.

      "[Studies of Nocardia pellegrino SN 5108 pigment mutants: reasons for differences in pigmentation (author's transl)]. Yellow and white mutants of the strains Nocardia pellegrino SN 5108 R have been isolated. Regarding their morphological and physiological properties, the mutants are identical with the wild type bacteria with the exception of their pigmentation and lipid composition. However, the pigment composition (number, Rf-values and spectra of the pigment components) of the yellow mutant is identical with that of the wild type; as a consequence, the modified pigmentation of the yellow mutant cannot be explained by an altered pigment synthesis. The wild type cells and the mutant SN 5108 G contain three main pigment components designated as I, II and III. Components II and III posses a marked indicator character and show a bathochromic shift in solutions of pH 12 or higher. Components II and III contain functional groups which are able to react with acetic acid yielding acetylated products; after acetylating, no bathochromic shift in alkali occurs. Intact cells of the wild type retain their orange-red pigmentation in buffer solution with a pH-value of 12 or higher. Cells of the yellow mutant, however, change the yellow color immediately after the alkali treatment to orange-red; this new color is identical with that of the wild type and can be changed to yellow by placing the cells into 1 N HCl. Regarding these facts it seems to be very probable that the functional groups of the pigment components II and III are differently bound in the wild type and mutant cells. In the mutant, they are accessible to OH- ions yielding a bathochromic shift while in the wild type cells, OH- ions are unable to provoke this shift. It seems to be also probable that different lipids in the two strains are responsible for the binding of the pigments. So far known, this is the first observation about the occurence of pigment mutants with an altered pigment binding site in the cells.\n",
      "Formation and some factors influencing the activity of progesterone hydroxylases by Aspergillus niger. The formation of progesterone hydroxylases by Aspergillus niger 173 was investigated. The constitution of the fermentation medium influenced both the yield and the type of enzymes catalyzing the transformation of progesterone. The enzyme yield also varied with the pH value at which induction was performed as well as with the buffer used. The transformation activity of progesterone was more pronounced with mycelia induced in citrate-phosphate than in phosphate buffer. The results demonstrated that induction of 6beta-hydroxylase was favoured at pH values near neutrality while that of 11alpha-hydroxylase in the presence of citrate ions. The transformation activity of progesterone was optimal at pH 5.0. The action of 11alpha-hydroxylase was also optimal at pH 5.0, but other hydroxylase showed pH optima between 2.2 and 4.0. Progesterone concentrations higher than 6 mg in 50 ml reaction mixture was a limiting factor for the rate of transformation activity.\n",

      "Alanine formation and alanine aminotransferase activity in the nerve tissue with proliferating macroglia.

The substrate saturation curves, apparent Km and pH optimum values in the tissue with proliferating macroglia and in the control did not differ from one another. The authors assume that a higher alanine aminotransferase activity in the tissue with macroglia proliferation can reflect either a higher synthesis of the enzyme in the altered tissue, or a predominance of glial elements in the altered tissue possessing a higher alanine aminotransferase activity than the nerve cells.\n",
      "Influence of sugar content in soft bread on pH of human dental plaque. Quantitative determination of monosaccharides, disaccharides and sorbitol by use of gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) was performed on thirty-three samples of different commercial soft bread.

Up to 20 per cent of the fresh bread weight was found to be low-molecular weight carbohydrates. Plaque pH-changes were studied in 18 persons following a 30-second month rinse with each of 3 solutions: (1) 50% sucrose, (2) water extract of sweetened bread, and (3) water extract of unsweetened bread.

The effect of ring substituents in phenoxypropranolamines upon affinity for the beta-adrengeric receptors is therefore unrelated to the strength of the bases. Two alterantive hypotheses are fowarded to explain why phenoxypropranolamines have greater affinities for the beta-receptors than phenethanolamines.\n",
      "Inhibition by acidosis of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate accumulation and lipolysis in isolated rat fat cells. Lipolysis and cyclic AMP accumulation were studied in isolated rat fat cells at normal (7.4) and decreased (7.0, 6.6) pH. Acidosis inhibited lipolysis and cyclic AMP accumulation due to NA non-competetively. Maximal lipolysis (3 muM NA) was inhibited by 25% at pH 7.0 and by 61% at pH 6.6 Cyclic AMP accumulation 5 min after 3 muM NA was inhibited by 57% at pH 7.0 and by 83% at pH 6.6. Between 10 and 60 minutes of incubation NA-stimulated lipolysis was linear at pH 7.4, whereas a progressively increasing inhibition was seen at lower pH. The FFA production was inhibited to the same degree as glycerol production by acidosis. The fraction of FFA associated with the cells was the same at all pHs. Thus, we have no evidence that acidosis inhibits lipolysis via accumulation of FFA intracellularly. NA-induced accumulation of 3H-cAMP from 3H-ATP, endogenously formed by prelabelling the cells with 3H-adenine, was inhibited by acidosis both in the presence and absence of theophylline in the incubation medium (by 48 and 44% respectively at pH 7.0 and by 74 and 68% at pH 6.6). Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in homogenates of fat cells was inhibited by decreasing the pH, whether measured at high or low substrate concentrations. Basal adenylyl cyclase activity in a cell membrane fraction from fat cells was affected to a minor degree, while NA-stimulated activity was inhibited by decreased pH. The response to 3 muM NA at pH 6.6 was inhibited by 43% relative to control. The results show that acidosis inhibits NA-induced cyclic AMP accumulation by interfering with the formation, rather than the inactivation of the nucleotide. Since NA-induced lipolysis is a cyclic AMP-mediated process it is suggested that at least part of the antilipolytic effect of acidosis is due to inhibition of cyclic AMP formation.\n",
      "Cyclic AMP-dependent and independent inhibition of lipolysis by adenosine and decreased pH. NA-stimulated lipolysis and cAMP formation in isolated rat fat cells is inhibited by acidosis. In the present report we have examined the quantitative relationship between lipolysis and cAMP formation at normal and reduced pH and the possible involvement of adenosine, an endogenous inhibitor of cAMP formation. Adenosine antagonized cAMP accumulation and to a considerably lower degree lipolysis, effects potentiated by acidosis. Theophylline, an antagonist of adenosine effects, stimulated lipolysis and cAMP-accumulation, and potentiated responses to NA. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) had theophylline-like effects. Acidosis inhibited lipolysis and cAMP accumulation induced by ADA and theophylline to a larger extent than those induced by NA. It is suggested that adenosine modulates fat cell cAMP production and may contribute to the antilipolytic effect of acidosis. There was a curvilinear relationship between cAMP elevation and glycerol production in fat cell suspensions, which was different at pH 7.4 and at pH 6.6. The amount of cAMP needed for half-maximal activation of lipolysis increased from 1.3 (pH 7.4) to 3.1 pMol X 10(-5) cells (pH 6.6). The maximal glycerol production was reduced from 1 300 to 900 nMol X 10(-5) cells. The antilipolytic effect of acidosis is apparently due partly to an inhibition of cAMP formation and partly to inhibition of subsequent step(s) in the activation sequence.\n",
      "Modification of the gastric secretory response to sham feeding by acidification of the antrum and the duodenum in dogs. The effect of closure of a gastric cannula on the acid response to sham feeding was studied in Pavlov-pouch dogs with intact antro-duodenal regions as well as in antrectomized dogs with gastroduodenostomies. In the latter dogs, the sham feeding response was augmented by infusions of low doses of exogenous gastrin. The acid output after sham feeding in intact dogs was reduced on average by 59% by closure of the gastric cannula. In antrectomized dogs receiving a back-ground stimulation with gastrin, the response to ham feeding was not inhibited by closure of the cannula. The results suggest that the observed hypersecretory response to sham feeding after diversion of gastric acid from antrum and duodenum is mainly due to inactivation of antral inhibitory mechanisms. The pepsin secretion following sham feeding was not consistently changed by closure of the gastric cannula.\n",
      "Beta adrenergic dilator component of the sympathetic vascular response in skeletal muscle. Influence on the micro-circulation and on transcapillary exchange. A neurogenic beta-adrenergic vasodilatation in skeletal muscle has been indicated by some recent investigations. The present study describes the extent to which this neurogenic beta-dilator mechanism contributes to the integrated vascular response in consecutive sections of the muscle vascular bed during sympathetic nerve activation. This was done by studying the vascular reactions to graded sympathetic stimulation (1-16 Hz) before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Beta-blockade did not influence significantly the sympathetically induced changes of total muscle vascular resistance or capacitance. Vascular tone in the \"micro-vessels\" during stimulation was, however, clearly more pronounced in the beta-blocked than in the non-blocked region, as revealed by segmental resistance analysis and by determination of precapillary sphincter tone (CFC). In addition, beta-blockade markedly reduced the net transcapillary absorption of extravascular fluid evoked by nerve activation. This effect could be ascribed to the mentioned influence on the precapillary sphincters, leading to a decrease of the number of capillaries available for transcapillary exchange, and to a limitation of the nerve induced fall of capillary hydrostatic pressure. The described effects of alpha-blockade were observed at all rates of sympathetic stimulation.--The conclusion was reached that the beta-adrenergic dilator component of the sympathetic vascular response in skeletal muscle significantly modifies the alpha-adrenergic constriction in the micro-vessels. It is suggested that, in the intact organism, this neurogenic beta-dilator mechanism is primarily aimed at improving the transcapillary exchange.\n",
      "Haematologic adaptation in patients with chronic bronchitis and pulmonary insufficiency. The relationship between respiratory insufficiency, expressed by gas tensions in blood and bone marrow, and haematologic adaptation has been studied in 82 men with chronic bronchitis and persistent breathlessness for at least one year. For the group as a whole and for various subgroups, a linear correlation was demonstrated between arterial hypoxia and Hb concentration, haematocrit, blood volume, Hb mass and erythrocyte volume, respectively. The increase in Hb concentration compensated for the fall in arterial oxygen saturation. Only for one subgroup, with a pH difference between arterial and venous blood larger than or equal to 0.08, was no correlation found between the degree of hypoxia and Hb concentration. The haematologic parameters correlated significantly better with arterial oxygen tensions than with oxygen tensions in the bone marrow. There was no indication that decreased oxygen supply to the bone marrow led to the increased erythrocyte and Hb production in patients with arterial hypoxia caused by chronic bronchitis.\n",
      "Pattern of enzyme activity following acute myocardial infarction with special reference to gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The present study on 55 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) draws attention to the relationship between different enzyme maxima in AMI, with special reference to serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (S-GT). In more than 60% of the patients the S-GT was increased during the hospital stay. The S-GT rise nearly always began during the first days,  reached a maximum within 5--8 days and normalized with 2--3 weeks. We failed to find the late increase in S-GT reported by others. The rise of S-GT is particularly common in patients with inferior infarction, with or without right ventricular involvement. We conclude that S-GT activity is not a useful early or late indicator of AMI but a very sensitive test for hepatic dysfunction in patients with AMI.\n",
      "Diamine oxydase in rabbit small intestine: separations from a soluble monoamine oxidase, properties and pathophysiological significance in intestinal ischemia. From all mammals investigated so far only in rabbits diamine oxidase could not be detected in any tissue except the gut. Thus this species was chosen for studying the physiological and pathophysiological function of this enzyme in the gastrointestinal tract. By gel filtration on Sephadex G 50 and G 200 the enzyme was purified 100-fold, separated from a soluble monoamine oxidase, and the properties of the two enzymes were determined. Diamine oxidase from rabbit small intestine deaminated putrecine (Km = 1.3 times 10(-4) M, pH-optimum 6.4-6.9) and histamine (Km = 8 times 10(-5) M, pH-optimum 7.5), but not serotonin, and was inhibited by aminoguanidine, but not by pargyline. Soluble monoamine oxidase from rabbit small intestine catabolized serotonin (Km = 1.8 times 10(-4) M, pH-optimum 8.8) but not putrescine and histamine, and was inhibited by pargyline, but not by aminoguanidine. Based on its properties in vitro intestinal diamine oxidase could inactivate the vasoactive biogenic amine histamine in vivo. To confirm this hypothesis, in rabbits the small intestine was damaged severely by inducing total intestinal ischemia, which occurs as mesenteric infarction also in human subjects and is accompanied by histamine release. Treatment with aminoguanidine and ischemia killed the animals 3-times faster than ischemia alone, which supported our hypothesis on a protective role of intestinal diamine oxidase against histamine.\n",
      "Myocardial ischemia and cell acidosis: Modification by alkali and the effects on ventricular function and cation composition. Myocardial cell pH was measured with 5, 5 dimethyl-2, 4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) in intact anesthetized dogs by a transient indicator dilution technique. Bolus injections of labeled DMO, vascular, extracellular and water indicators were made into the left anterior descending coronary artery, and blood samples were collected from the great cardiac vein. The steady state distribution of DMO between cells and plasma was calculated from the mean transit times of the indicator. Normal myocardial cell pH averaged 6.94 and changed by 58% of the concomitant alterations in plasma pH after infusions of acid or alkali. Myocardial ischemia induced by inflation of a balloon tip catheter in the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in progressive decreases in cell pH to 6.59 by 1 hour. Infusions of sodium carbonate diminished intracellular acidosis. Hemodynamic studies during 4 hours of ischemia with blood pH at 7.55 to 7.60 indicated a significantly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increased stroke volume by comparison with findings in animals given infusions of saline solution. Ventriculograms revealed improved wall motion in the ischemic segment after infusion of alkali. Precordial mapping showed a significant reduction in the number of leads with S-T segment elevation as well as in the sum of S-T segment elevations, but R wave amplitudes did not differ from those in control studies. Calculations of extracellular space, tissue water and cation content revealed a reduced gain of cell sodium ion and loss of cell potassium ion during ischemia after alkali treatment. The latter may account for the S-T segment responses, whereas enhanced ventricular performance may be related to reduced competition of hydrogen ion with calcium ion for binding sites on contractile protein.\n",
      "Effects of allopurinol, propranolol and methylprednisolone on infarct size in experimental myocardial infarction. With use of a canine model of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and an intracellular lactic dehydrogenase stain to measure infarct size directly, the effects of allopurinol, methylprednisolone sodium succinate and propranolol were studied. Allopurinol did not influence the extent of myocardial necrosis, whereas both methylprednisolone and propranolol significantly reduced myocardial infarct size. Possible mechanisms of action and clinical applicability of these agents are discussed.\n",
      "Effects of cedilanid-D in combination with metoprolol on exercise tolerance and systolic time intervals in angina pectoris. The interaction between cedilanid-D and metoprolol, a selective beta receptor blocking agent, on exercise tolerance and systolic intervals was studied in 15 patients with angina pectoris. The patients had been treated with metoprolol for several months in a dose of 50 mg, three times daily (one patient received 25 mg three times daily). Each patient participated in two studies separated by at least 1 week. After arriving at the laboratory each received 50 mg of metoprolol orally; thereafter, either cedilanid-D or placebo was infused intravenously in a double-blind study performed in randomized order. When the effect of the drugs was maximal, the systolic intervals and the heart volume were recorded at rest, and the exercise tolerance was tested with a bicycle ergometer. The mean maximal value of plasma concentrations of metoprolol assessed during the study was about 50 ng/ml but the variation among subjects was great (20 to 187 ng/ml). After administration of cedilanid-D there was a shortening of the pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection time compared with results after placebo; the reduction was similar to that found after administration  of cedilanid-D without beta blocking drugs. The total heart volume decreased by an average of 55 ml, but the individual variation was great. The patients' average work capacity, expressed as total work, was not altered by cedilanid-D when compared with results after placebo. No relation was found between initial heart size and the effect of cedilanid-D on capacity for physical work. It therefore appears that there is no indication for the routine use of digitalis during beta blocking therapy in patients with angina pectoris who do not have cardiac failure.\n",
      "Beta adrenergic blockade and diuretic therapy in benign essential hypertension: A dynamic assessment. Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta blockers) differ greatly in their cardioselectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and these differences may have important therapeutic consequences. We have therefore studied the effect on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity of the beta blocking drug oxprenolol (Trasicor) which has considerable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, both alone and in combination with the benzothiadiazine cyclopenthiazide. Eleven patients with mild to moderate benign essential hypertension were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. Oxprenolol was given as the first drug to Group 1, and cyclopenthiazide as the first drug to Group 2. The patients were assessed before the start of treatment, after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with one drug and after a further 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with both drugs. Heart rate, blood pressure and plasma renin activity were measured with the patients recumbent and after a standardized tilt to 85 degrees to provide a reflection of day to day cardiovascular stress. Oxprenolol reduced arterial blood pressure without inducing significant bradycardia. The addition of cyclopenthiazide had little further effect. Oxprenolol alone suppressed plasma renin activity both at rest and during tilt and also abolished the increase in plasma renin activity after administration of cyclopenthiazide. The combination of (1) moderate reduction of blood pressure. (2) inhibition of the otherwise inevitable increase in plasma renin activity with the use of a diuretic drug, and (3) only moderate inhibition of overall sympathetic activity indicates that it is possible to achieve physiologic balance with the appropriate beta blocking drug.\n",
      "Control of renin release: a review of experimental evidence and clinical implications. Present knowledge of the mechanisms regulating release of renin is reviewed with particular emphasis on neural factors. Evidence is given for a direct effect of renal innervation on beta adrenergic receptors in juxtaglomerular cells, and for the involvement of reflex release of renin in conditions such as tilting and acute salt depletion. Participation of neural and nonneural mechanisms of control is also shown to occur in other conditions, such as aortic constriction and hemorrhage. The view is held that neural sympathetic factors might explain some of the renin disturbances found in essential hypertension. First, in patients with high renin hypertension part of the hypertension is renin-dependent, and these pressor levels of renin seem to be neurally induced since they can commonly be suppressed by beta adrenoreceptor blocking agents. Second, the hypothesis is presented that patients with low renin hypertension, at least those who have no volume disturbance, have a blunted sympathetic control of renin release. Therefore a sufficiently precise test of sympathetic activity, and possibly of body fluid volumes, should be associated with renin profiles for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension and as a better guide to therapeutic management. Indeed, most of the available antihypertensive drugs act on sympathetic activity, body fluid volume or renin, and this multifaceted profile would provide more rational guidelines for treatment.\n",

      "Bactericidal activity and pharmacology of flucloxacillin. Flucloxacillin, a recent addition to the group of isoxazolyl penicillins, was studied in vitro and in normal volunteers. The bactericidal activity of the drug against most strains of gram-positive bacteria including penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was similar to that of oxacillin and approximately fourfold greater than that of cloxacillin. Each of the three penicillins was administered orally to a group of ten volunteers for eight days in a dose of 500 mg four times a day. The mean concentrations of flucloxacillin in the serum were two- to sixfold higher than those of the other two agents on the first, fourth and eighth days of therapy. The percentage of flucloxacillin bound by serum protein was 94.6 per cent; for cloxacillin and oxacillin the values were 93.5 and 91.5 per cent, respectively. Using these data, the concentrations of free flucloxacillin in serum were found to be twice as high as those of cloxacillin and oxacillin. These findings suggest that, when administered orally, this new agent may offer some therapeutic advantage over oxacillin and cloxacillin.\n",
      "Nephrology rounds, University of Iowa Hospitals: renal tubular acidosis. We have discussed two patients who had renal tubular acidosis complicated by hypokalemia. The first patient had a distal acidifying defect. Circumstantial evidence has been presented suggesting that exposure to toluene-diisocyanate or toluene-diamine played a role in the pathogenesis. The acidosis and the hypokalemia of this patient were easily corrected by the administration of small amounts of sodium bicarbonate without potassium supplementation. The second patient had an interstitial nephritis of unknown etiology and presented with moderate renal insufficiency, renal tubular acidosis, and proximal as well as distal acidifying defects. The proximal tubular dysfunction was associated with general aminoaciduria and glucosuria. This patient required large quantities of both alkali and potassium to correct the electrolyte abnormalities. The mechanisms of potassium wasting in proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis are reviewed. A classification is presented of cellular defects that may underlie the different renal acidifying defects. Attempts to distinguish between pump and permeability defects from urinary pCO2 levels must take into account the simultaneous HCO-3 concentration, since large pCO2 elevations require the presence of ample HCO-3 in the urine. Permeability defects may impair urinary acidification by either abnormal back flux of H+ out of the lumen or increased influx of HCO-3 into the lumen. In studies of acidification in vitro, amphotericin B causes increased H+ permeability and has little effect on HCO-3 permeability. Toluene-diamine causes a marked permeability defect which is reversible, but remains to be defined in terms of the ion species, HCO-3 or H+, affected. At times, hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by distal defects in net acid excretion that occur without impairment of the H+ gradient. In certain patients with hypoaldosteronism, for example, distal H+ secretion may be reduced without change in the force of the H+ pump.\n",
      "Effects of salicylate and bile salt on ion transport by isolated gastric mucosa of the rabbit. The effects of luminal addition of salicylate and taurocholate on ion transport by fundic mucosa were examined in vitro using isotopic and pH stat techniques. Salicylate, 3 mM, did not alter, but 20 mM caused a 40% decrease in, the acid secretory rate. Taurocholate, 20 mM, caused a transient, apparent cessation of acid secretion followed by stimulation. Salicylate, 3 or 20 mM, increased Na+ but not Cl- permeability at luminal pH 7. At luminal pH 4, however, salicylate increased Cl- in addition to Na+ and H+ permeability. Taurocholate, 10 or 20 mM, increased both cation and anion permeability at pH 7 and 4. Addition of salicylate or taurocholate results in stimulation of net Na+ transport. While salicylate and taurocholate increase cation permeability at pH 7, they have differing effects on acid secretion and anion permeability. The data suggest that salicylate and taurocholate alter cation permeability by different mechanisms and are consistent with the concept that enhanced diffusion of H+ into the tissue causes a nonspecific alteration in the permeability pathway.\n",
      "Characteristics of intestinal phase of gastric secretion. In four dogs provided with special gastroduodenal fistulas allowing for the complete separation of stomach and duodenum without interrupting the vagal connections between them, the magnitude of the gastric and intestinal phases was compared and their contribution to the total gastric response to a meal was established. A liver extract (LE) meal, confined to the stomach and maintained at pH 5.0 by an intragastric titration technique, produced acid output reaching 66% of the maximal response to histamine (MRH). Perfusion of the LE meal into the duodenum resulted in acid secretion amounting to 57% of MRH. The combination of the gastric and intestinal phases caused the highest acid output, amounting to about 90% of MRH. Gastric and intestinal phases induced separately were accompanied by a significant elevation in serum gastrin concentrations which reached the highest values when both phases were evoked simultaneously. Acidification of the intestinal meal resulted in pH-dependent inhibition of gastric secretion falling to the basal values at pH 1.0. These secretory changes were mimicked by exogenous secretin. Serum gastrin levels remained essentially unaffected by the acidification of the intestinal meal while exogenous secretin significantly lowered them. In conclusion, in the intact stomach with undisturbed nervous connections between the stomach and duodenum, a peptone meal in the intestine is capable of evoking a potent gastric acid and pepsin stimulation by a mechanism involving the release of antral hormone.\n",
      "Inhibition of gastric secretion in the dog by 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. The synthetic prostaglandin 16,16-dimethyl E2 (PGE2) given by intravenous infusion at 0.4 mug/kg-h inhibited gastric secretion of H+, K+, Cl-, and pepsin in four fistula dogs stimulated by histamine (H), pentagastrin (P), urecholine (U), and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). When given for 90 min during steady infusions of near-maximal doses of H, P, and U, PG-E2 caused 75% inhibition of H+ maximally at 90 min and over 85% inhibition of pepsin secretion maximally at 45 min. Recovery of secretion took 1-2 h after infusion of PGE2 was stopped. Injection of KCl, 1 meq/kg, during inhibition of histamine by PGE2 gave only a 15-min transient reversal in inhibition. When PGE2 was given as background to 45-min step-dose responses, 0.1 mug/kg competitively inhibited histamine stimulation and 0.4 mug/kg-h gave 100% inhibition. Against pentagastrin, 0.1 mug PGE2/kg-h had no effect and 0.4 mug caused uncompetitive inhibition; against urecholine, 0.4 mug PGE2/kg-h caused competitive inhibition of H+ secretion. Pepsin was more markedly inhibited in each case. There were no side effects at either dose of PGE2, which is a potent inhibitor of gastric secretion with all forms of stimuli.\n",
      "Effect of carbon monoxide on equilibrium between oxygen and hemoglobin. Oxygen dissociation curves of partially CO-saturated human whole blood drawn freshly or preserved more than 3 wk were studied. With increasing CO-hemoglobin concentrations, oxygen affinity of the blood increased and the Hill coefficient, n, fell and gradually approached unity. The changes induced by CO-hemoglobin showed practically no difference in the presence or absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The Bohr coefficient, deltalog P50/deltapH, was determined as a function of oxygen saturation for various concentrations of CO-hemoglobin. The coefficient remained essentially unchanged in the presence of CO-hemoglobin. In the presence of less than 50% CO-hemoglobin, a good agreement was observed between the observed oxygen dissociation curves and the curves calculated according to Roughton and Darling (Am. J. Physiol. 141: 17-31, 1944). Based on these results, physiological implications of carboxyhemoglobinemia are discussed quantitatively in comparison with methemoglobinemia.\n",
      "Erythropoietin production after renal denervation or beta-adrenergic blockade. The ability of either beta-adrenergic blockade or bilateral renal denervation to alter erythropoietin (ESF) production in rabbits exposed to hypobaric hypoxia was studied. ESF elaboration during 5 h of exposure to hypoxia was not affected by beta-blockade, but was markedly reduced by prior surgical denervation of both kidneys. After 18 h of hypoxia plasma ESF levels in renal denervated rabbits did not differ significantly from those of sham-operated controls. Previous studies have shown that ESF production during this more prolonged exposure to hypoxia was significantly inhibited by some beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Combined renal denervation and beta-blockade were more effective than renal denervation alone in attenuating ESF production during 5 h of exposure to hypoxia. However, ESF elaboration during 18 h of hypoxia was significantly greater in animals with combined denervation and beta-blockade than in control rabbits. These results suggest the existence of two distinct mechanisms for ESF production in rabbits exposed to hypobaric hypoxia.\n",
      "The current status of behavioral psychotherapy: theory and practice. Behavioral psychotherapy has become one of the definitive treatments available for the relief of psychiatric suffering. Although hardly a panacea for all ills, the behavioral approach is the treatment of choice for certain selected problems. Behavioral methods make their contribution in the context of general psychiatric management and often must be used in conjunction with other treatment. The theoretical and practical aspects of behavioral psychotherapy have changed a great deal over the past few years and continue to evolve rapidly. Although useful molecular theories are emerging to guide the discipline, no global theory is likely to be satisfactory in the foreseeable future.\n",
      "Effect of drug ritual changes on schizophrenic patients. The author evaluated the charts of 115 chronic schizophrenic patients who regularly attended a follow-up group to determine whether changes in long-standing medication regimens produced an increased dropout rate, decreased attendance, or psychotic decompensation. He found that although there were nonsignificant trends showing a relationship between medication change and group attendance for individual patients, there were no significant difference between group attendance and change or no change in medication routine for the group of patients as a whole. He concludes that necessary changes in medication routines for chronic schizophrenic patients are safe.\n",
      "A simple technique for demonstrating transmission of dengue virus by mosquitoes without the use of vertebrate hosts. Aedes albopictus mosquitoes infected with dengue type 2 virus transmitted virus to measured small amounts of fluid which could be titrated readily for virus content. It was found that the percentage of mosquitoes transmitting was related to the extent of salivary gland infection. It was not uncommon for mosquitoes to transmit as much as 10(4) mosquito infectious doses50 of virus and transmission of significant amounts of virus was observed even though an insect only probed the test suspension without feeding to repletion. Transmission of virus was demonstrated as early as 10 days after oral infection when mosquitoes were held at 32 degrees C.\n",
      "Ecologic studies of Venezuelan encephalitis virus and isolations of Nepuyo and Patois viruses during 1968-1973 at a marsh habitat near the epicenter of the 1969 outbreak in Guatemala. Ecologic studies of Venezuelan encephalitis (VE) virus at a marsh habitat near the epicenter of the 1969 outbreak in Guatemala revealed that the virus was enzootic there. VE virus was isolated yearly during 1968-1973 from sentinel hamsters exposed during the rainy seasons and from mosquitoes collected during July and August 1970. Hamsters yielded 41 strains of VE virus and virus was detected within 2 km of the edge of the marsh, in its interior, and at its western extreme 18 km from the central study site at La Avellana. One strain of virus came from a hamster that died in the dry season of January 1970. Culex mosquitoes yielded 20 strains of VE virus and Mansonia and Aedes one each. Culex (Melanoconion) and Aedes taeniorhynchus were most prevalent near the marsh. Hemagglutination-inhitibion (HI) and neutralization antibody tests of sera showed that wild terrestrial mammals (opossums and rodents), humans, and dogs, but not wild birds, were frequently infected. Seven of 16 susceptible residents of villages at the edge of the marsh developed antibodies without symptoms during an 18-month period between September 1971 and February 1973. Only 1 of 5 sentinel rabbits, and none of 30 sentinel chickens developed VE HI antibody during August-September 1971, a period when virus activity was readily detected by the use of sentinel hamsters. Five strains of group C arbovirus (one identified as Nepuyo) were recovered from sentinel hamsters during 1968 to 1970, and one strain of Nepuyo virus was isolated from the blood of a person with a febrile illness during 1972. Two strains of Patois group arboviruses were isolated from Culex mosquitoes during 1970.\n",
      "Studies of possible movement of Venezuelan encephalitis virus from an enzootic focus in Guatemala during 1971-1974. During the wet seasons of 1972 and possibly 1971, sentinel horses became infected by Venezuelan encephalitis (VE) virus in a temporally and geographically progressive manner inland from an enzootic marsh focus of virus on the Pacific couast of southeastern Guatemala. During the wet seasons of 1972 and 1973, VE virus was detected by sentinel horses (and a sentinel hamster in 1972) in a small woods 10 km north of the marsh, but virus was undetectable there during the dry seasons of 1973 and 1974 and the wet season of 1974. Culex (Melanoconion) mosquitoes were found in this woods and at the marsh during August 1973. These observations are compatible with movement of VE virus from the marsh habitat during some wet seasons. However, virus activity in this region adjacent to the marsh was quantitatively unpredictable on a yearly basis and occurred in only very focal habitats during 1971 to 1974. Mechanisms of VE virus movement from the marsh are currently unknown, but bats are under study as a likely possibility.\n",
      "Hepatitis B surface antigen (Australia antigen) in mosquitoes collected in Senegal, West Africa. During July and August of 1973, 9,198 mosquitoes were collected in the Republic of Senegal. Eight species of mosquitoes were found in the collections: Culex thalassius, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, Culex trigripes, Culex phillipi, Aedes irritans, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Mansonia sp. Specimens were sorted by biological condition; those obviously engorged were designated as (E), females with swollen abdomens not conspicuously blooded were considered gravid (G), and those with normal or shrunken abdomens were considered neither blooded nor gravid (U). Representative samples of each species were tested by solid phase radioimmunoassay for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg, Australia antigen). A total of 12 mosquitoes were found to be HBSAg positive out of 1,658 individuals tested. These were: 9 Culex thalassius, 1 (E), 5 (G), 3 (U); 2 Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, 1 (E), 1 (U); and Aedes irritans, 1 (U).\n",
      "Hemorrhagic shock in dogs. Comparison of treatment with shed blood alone versus shed blood plus Ringer's lactate: intravascular pressures, cardiac output, oxygen consumption, arteriovenous oxygen differences, extracellular fluid PO2, electrolyte changes, and survival rates. The purpose of our study of hemorrhagic shock in dogs was to examine the efficacy of adding Ringer's lactate to shed blood replacement in increasing animal rates. The standard Wiggers' hemorrhagic shock technic was used in two groups of ten animals each. Intravascular pressures, cardiac outut, oxygen consumption, arteriovenous oxygen differences, extracellular fluid PO2 and pH, electrolyte changes, and survival rates were determined. There was a positive correlation between changes in cardiac output, central venous oxygen content, and PO2 and extracellular fluid PO2 as measured using subcutaneously implanted Silastic tubing and perforated plastic balls. Four of the dogs that received shed blood alone survived, whereas five of the dogs that received shed blood plus Ringer's lactate survived. This difference was not statistically significant.\n",
      "[Conformational changes of hyaluronic acid in acid medium (author's transl)]. Both vitreous body homogenate and a fibrous product containing hyaluronic acid and collagen isolated from vitreous humor by acetone precipitation were investigated to elucidate the liquefaction of vitreous body by acids. Graphic evaluation of the titration with hydrochlorid acid and viscosity measurements suggest a changed of the hyaluronic acid molecule in the pH-range between 5.2 and 4.1. Between these pH-values the ionization of carboxyl groups is decreased accompanied by conformational changes of the hyaluronic acid molecule. These results are in agreement with the conclusion of other authors that by lowering the pH of hyaluronic acid solutions a random coil to double helix transition of hyaluronic acid occurs.\n",
      "Treatment of the diving casualty. In a diving emergency a number of specific conditions are possible in addition to those which would ordinarily be considered in a life-threatening situation. There are many separate factors which, underwater, can lead by some unfortunate combination of circumstances towards death usually, but not always, by drowning. The other major category of accidents are those resulting from the ascent of the diver to the surface. These must be considered as medical emergencies and the majority respond to immediate recompression. In the absence of readily available recompression facilities,various measures may ameliorate the condition pending transfer to a suitable compression chamber.\n",
      "Scanning electron microscopic study of chylomicrons incubated with lipoprotein lipase. The effects of lipolysis on the structure of chylomicrons were studied with the scanning electron microscope using rat chylomicrons incubated with purified bovine milk lipoprotein lipase for 20 minutes at pH 8.1. Since the amount of albumin added to the medium was limited, some of the free fatty acids and partial glycerides formed by lipolysis accumulated in the chylomicrons. Lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed with OSO4 at pH 7.4 appeared in scanning electron micrographs as spheres with multiply idented irregular surfaces, while those fixed at pH 5.5, AS WELL AS CONTROL CHYLOMICRONS FIXED AT BOTH PHs, appeared as spheres with smooth surfaces. Sections of OSO4-fixed specimens, viewed with the transmission electron microscope, showed that the core of lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed at pH 7.4 contained numerous circular electron-lucent areas at the periphery, thus accounting for the indented surfaces observed above, while the core surfaces of the other specimens were circular and smooth. These findings confirm an earlier report that aqueous spaces form in chylomicrons during lipolysis when albumin in the medium is limited, and that the aqueous spaces disappear when specimens are prepared at pH 5.5 for microscopy. Thin sections of specimens that had been prepared for scanning electron microscopy showed that the gold-palladium coating was desposited directly on the indented surface of the lipid core of lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed at pH 7.4. It is concluded that vacuum dehydration during specimen preparation ruptures the outer wall of the aqueous spaces in lipolyzed chylomicrons and thereby exposes the interior of the spaces to gold-palladium coating and viewing with the scanning electron microscope.\n",
      "Effects of training on biochemical values in standardbred horses. Effects of training at a regular, fixed, standard exercise load on venous lactic acid, mixed venous and arterial blood gases and pH, and serum muscle enzymes were determined on previously unconditioned, healthy, adult, Standardbred horses. Arterial and mixed venous blood gases, pH, and serum muscle enzymes did not change in a consistent manner during training. Venous lactic acid concentrations did increase significantly with training and may be of value for the biochemical evaluation of fitness in horses.\n",
      "Acid-base values of standardbred horses recovering from strenuous exercise. Blood gases, lactic acid concentrations, and pH were measured in arterial and mixed venous blood in moderately conditioned Standardbred horses after a standardized exercise load of 1.6 km in 2 minutes, 40 seconds. Samples were obtained at rest, immediately after exercise, and at 3, 6, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after exercise. Arterial oxygen tension and mixed venous oxygen tension increased after exercise, reaching peak values at 6 minutes. Arterial oxygen tension returned to the resting (preexercise) value by 15 minutes, and mixed venous oxygen tension by 30 minutes. Arterial carbon dioxide tension decreased immediately after exercise, reaching its lowest value at 6 minutes, and returned to resting value by 30 minutes. Mixed venous carbon dioxide tension reached its highest value immediately after exercise, then decreased to less than the resting value, reaching its lowest value by 15 minutes, and returned to normal by 60 minutes. Lactic acid concentration increased immediately after exercise, reaching its highest value at 6 minutes, and returned toward normal by 60 minutes. Arterial pH decreased immediately after exercise, reaching its lowest value at 6 minutes, and returned to normal by 60 minutes. Mixed venous pH reached its lowest value immediately after exercise, then began to increase, and returned to normal by 60 minutes. The decrease in mixed venous pH was more pronounced than that in arterial blood since, in addition to the increase in lartic acid, there was a considerable increase in mixed venous carbon dioxide tension.\n",
      "[Metabolic acidosis and intravenous injections of fat emulsions (role of phospholipids. Experimental study)]. In explanation of metabolic acidosis during parenteral nutrition, the authors considered the supply of H+ ions by fat emulsion, containing phospholipids of egg or soy. During intravenous infusions of 24 grams of lecithins to two healthy subjects, they observed an increased output H+ ions in urine, about 74,05 and 75,88 mEq, and a metabolic acidosis of the plasma. The theorically forcasted supply of production was 74,6 mEq. Indeed the metabolism of phospholipids supplies phosphoric ions (PO4H3), giving H+ ions at pH 7,40. The most used fat emulsions are able to give between 37 (intralipid 10%) and 61 (lipihysan 15%) mEq of H+ ions/liter.\n",
      "Identification of immunoglobulins associated with complement fixation, agglutination, and low pH buffered antigen tests for brucellosis. Serums from infected cattle, cattle with persistent postvaccinal antibody, and serologically \"positive\" noninfected cattle were fractionated into major immunoglobulin classes by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose chromatography and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Each fraction was assayed for anti-Brucella activity by standard tube-agglutination test (STT), buffered tube-agglutination test (BTT), and complement-fixation test (CF). In the serums from experimentally infected cattle, anti-Brucella antibody could be found by all tests in 6 DEAE fractions and in slow, fast, and sediment regions of the density gradient. Serums from cattle with persistent postvaccinal titers had STT activity in all 6 DEAE fractions, BTT activity in 5 fractions, and CF activity in only 1 fraction. The STT and BTT activities were found in the slow and the sediment regions of the gradient, whereas the CF activity was found only in the slow region. Serums from a chronically infected animal had STT and BTT activities in 2 DEAE fractions and CF activity in only 1. The STT, BTT, and CF activities were found in the slow and the sediment regions of the gradient. The principal antibody in serums from noninfected cattle was immunoglobulin M, which had all of the CF activity and most of the STT and BTT activities. Low levels of STT and BTT activities were found in 3 other DEAE fractions. Only STT and BTT activities were found in the fast and the sediment regions of the gradient.\n",
      "Theoretic significance of pH dependence of narcotics and narcotic antagonists in clinical anesthesia. Determination of the effect of pH and temperature on pKa partition, and drug distribution coefficients in a series of common narcotics and their antagonists has shown that within the range of blood pH (7.1 to 7.7) encountered in the practice of anesthesiology, marked differences of distribution of the drugs between a model lipid (octanol) and water can occur. When these data are considered in the light of clinical experience with narcotics used in patients undergoing or recovering from surgical procedures, a correlation between the depth and duration of narcosis or the efficacy of narcotic antidotes and ventilatory status is seen. This correlation can be explained in part if the influence of blood pH on the probable CNS/blood distribution of a given drug is taken into consideration. Support is given to this proposal by representative studies in the literature. The very different drug distribution coefficients of two closely related narcotic antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, correctly predicted the faster onset and shorter duration of the former, which was confirmed by reported clinical observations.\n",

      "Plasmid-mediated penicillin beta-lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A penicillin beta-lactamase (PCase) was extracted from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Rms139(+) and purified by means of column chromatography. The isoelectric point of Rms139 PCase was 5.7 and its molecular weight was 22,500 +/- 1,000. The optimal pH for the hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin was 7.0 to 7.5 and the optimal temperature was 45 C, with the PCase also showing high activity against carbenicillin. It is concluded that this enzyme is a new type of penicillin beta-lactamase different from the type I, II, or III R plasmid-mediated PCases reported previously.\n",
      "Immunosuppressant activity of the ansamycins. The immunosuppressive effect of four analogues of rifampin and two streptovaracins on cell-mediated immunity has been determined. Tuberculin hypersensitivity in the footpads of immunized mice was inhibited by three of the rifampin analogues and by both streptovaracins. The observed in vivo immunosuppressive activity of the compounds tested was not correlated with their in vitro activity against mycobacterial growth but was associated with their toxicity in mice. These data indicate that some of the analogues of rifampin and the streptovaracins can significantly suppress cell-mediated immunity and suggest that other ansamycins may have significant immunosuppressant activity.\n",

      "Two XX males diagnosed in childhood. Endocrine, renal, and laboratory findings. Two prepubertal boys with bilateral cryptorchidism were identified as 46,XX after nuclear sexing studies in several tissues. Gonadal histology and chromosome studies suggested that true hermaphroditism or mosaicism were unlikely. Xg blood grouping was informative in one patient. Accepting paternity, this suggested either that both Xs were maternal, with loss, for example, of the male determining Y chromosome, or that the paternal X chromosome did not express, probably because of a deletion, the allele for the positive Xg blood group. The patients had normal thyroid stimulating hormone reserves but subnormal responses to human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation, and may need hormonal replacement at puberty. Both had renal anomalies. We suggest that chromosome analysis is essential when cryptorchidism, hypospadias, or microgenitalia are found and that an intravenous pyelogram is desirable.\n",
      "Establishment of a viable homograft cardiac valve bank: a rapid method of determining homograft viability. A method for determining the viability of homograft valves has been developed based on sequential measurements of glucose and pH levels of the culture medium in which cardiac valves have been maintained for short periods at 37 degrees C. Viable valves, as determined by tissue culture, showed a characteristic pattern of glucose utilization and pH reduction that was absent in nonviable valves. Upon explantation of valve leaflet fragments into tissue culture, only fragments from valves that metabolized glucose produced viable fibroblast cultures. The method reported here is rapid, requires no specialized equipment, is nondestructive, and can directly determine the viability of the valve homograft within 24 to 48 hours.\n",
      "Resin hemoperfusion for acute drug intoxication. Eight patients with drug intoxication were hemoperfused on ten occasions at a blood-flow rate of 300 ml/min with a 650gm column of Amberlite XAD-4 resin, which is a macroreticular resin with a specific adsorptive attraction for lipid-soluble organic molecules. Column clearances of glutethimide and a variety of barbiturates ranged from 207 to 300 ml/min for treatment sessions extending from 2 1/2 to ten hours. After ingestion of 75 gm of glutethimide, one patient received hemoperfusion on three successive days for nine, ten, and eight hours, respectively. She recovered after the column removed over 30 gm of drug. The patients demonstrated dramatic clinical responses with no evidence of meaningful toxic reactions. Column hemoperfusion with Amberlite XAD-4 resin was simpler and more effective than any known method of removing barbiturates and glutethimide from the blood of patients with drug overdoses.\n",
      "Increased mucociliary transport by adrenergic stimulation. Tracheobronchial clearance of inhaled 6mum Teflon particles (density 2 gm/cu cm) tagged with technetium 99m was studied in healthy subjects by external measurement of the radioactivity in the lungs for two hours. Clearance, salivary secretion, blood pressure, and heart rate were determined in eight subjects after double-blind, subcutaneous administration of 0.25 mg terbutaline sulfate, a beta-adrenoceptor stimulating compound and vehicle, respectively, in a crossover study. Terbutaline produced a marked increase in clearance and a slight increase in heart rate, but had no important effect on salivary secretion or blood pressure. The result indicates that the blood concentrations of catecholamines might be of importance for the regulation of the mucociliary transport rate.\n",
      "Platelet aggregation in portal cirrhosis. Primary and secondary platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate was studied in 24 patients with portal (Laënnec) cirrhosis and compared with platelet aggregation in 14 normal subjects. In 12 patients with cirrhosis, platelet aggregation was diminished when compared to controls. Of the 12 patients with impaired aggregation, 6 had elevated levels of fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products (FDPs), 11 had thrombocytopenia, 10 had shortened euglobulin lysis times, 11 had prolonged bleeding times, 4 had hypofibrinogenemia, and all had prolonged thrombin clotting times. The data suggest that elevated levels of serum FDPs do not explain fully the impairment of platelet aggregation or the prolongation of the thrombin clotting time that was noted in patients with advanced liver disease. A possible explanation for the prolongation of the thrombin clotting time is the presence of \"altered\" plasma fibrinogen.\n",

Histological and histochemical methods were used to study the ovaries of Greenland seal (Pagophoca groenlandica) from birth-time up to 30 years of age and mature females of Phoca vitulina and Erignathus barbatus. The ovary of the new-born Greenland seal has fetal medullary substance which is a provisory endocrinous gland producing not only sex hormones but also corticosteron. In other species of seals the intestinal cells of the medullary substance are the equivalent of this gland. Within 3-4 weeks after birth the reduction of the fetal medullary substance is completed, it is substituted by the connective tissue and the ovary acquires its typical structure. The rest of the fetal medullary substance is in the depth of the cortex and near the infundibulum of the ovary as lipofuscincontaining cells. When the maturation period approaches, the process of the follicle atresia regularly changes: the epithelium dies quicker, and the multiplication of intestinal cells increases. The ovaries of seals are rich in interstitial cells. Their amount cyclically changes. The cells producing steroid hormones always well hydrolize AS naphthyl-phosphates, the reaction with glycerophosphate is more variable. The connective tissue is poor in acid mucopolysaccharides, its amorphous substance in the ovary cortex is rich in protein. Senile changes of the ovary are noticed in the seal beginning from 20 years of age.\n",
      "[Endocrine cells of the gastric mucous membrane]. In order to obtain an additional information concerning a possible functional role of the main types of the endocrine cells (EC and ECL) on investigation of aspiration biopsy specimens taken from the middle third of the stomach in patients with ulcerative disease of the duodenum and chronic gastritis was carried out. Changes in morphology, distribution and number of the endocrine cells in pathology of the mucosa and in various acidity of the gastric juice were followed up. On the basis of the data obtained the conclusion is made that serotonin-producing (EC) cells seem to have nothing to do with the regulation of the activity of the fundal glands, whereas the enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL) influence the production of hydrochloric acid by pavement cells.\n",
      "Tranquilizers or anti-depressants for chronic schizophrenics: a long term study. The relative efficacy of 4 tranquilizers was investigated in 66 chronic schizophrenics who had been hospitalized for 10.01 years (mean). The role of adding an anti-depressant was also studied. Following a 4 week placebo period, high dosage tranquilizers were given for 16 weeks and amitriptyline was added for the following 16 weeks. Statistical analyses of the various change measures revealed that patients worsened significantly on placebo, all 4 tranquilizers were significantly better than placebo for symptom reduction and maximum improvement was attained within 16 weeks of tranquilizer administration. No significant differences in efficacy were observed among the 4 tranquilizers and addition of amitriptyline did not confer any additional therapeutic advantage.\n",
      "Physiological index as an aid in developing airline pilot scheduling patterns. A multiplicative and additive formula has been developed for assisting in the development of schedules for airline pilots and flight engineers. The formula is based on freshness/tiredness data derived from aircrews on world flights. It should materially assist those who develop the schedules to avoid, where possible, finalizing those crew patterns that would impose a severe physiologic load on cockpit personnel. The objective of the application of the formula is to assure that crew members retain adequate \"physiologic reserve\" in the course of flying various segments of a pattern. This enables them to absorb the stresses of schedule delays or disruptions, as well as unforeseen operational problems and flight emergencies.\n",
      "A neutral collagenase from human gastric mucosa. Biopsy specimens of human gastric mucosa, maintained in culture for 7 days in the absence of serum, released a collagen-degrading enzyme into the medium. The yield of active enzyme reached a maximum after 2-3 days, and viable tissue, capable of protein synthesis, was essential for its production. 2. At 25 degrees C the enzyme attacked undenatured collagen in solution, resulting in a 55% loss of specific viscosity and producing the two products TCA and TCB characteristic of neutral-collagenase action. 3. Electron microscopy of segment-long-spacing crystallites of these reaction products showed the exact cleavage locus of the collagen molecules to be between bands 43 and 44 (I-43). The larger TCA and smaller TCB products were fragments representing 77 and 23% respectively of the length of the collagen molecule. 4. Optimal enzyme activity was observed over the pH range 7.5-8.5 and a mol.wt. of approx. 38000 was derived from gel-filtration studies. 5. The enzyme was shown to be inhibited by the human serum proteins alpha2-macroglobulin and a smaller component of mol.wt. approx. 40000; alpha1-anti-trypsin was not inhibitory. 6. EDTA, 1, 10-phenanthroline, cysteine and dithiothreitol all inhibited collagenase activity. 7. The gastric enzyme has properties similar to other well characterized collagenases, but differences exist with respect to its molecular size and the site of attack on the collagen molecule.\n",
      "Adsorption of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase on condensed monolayers of phospholipid. The adsorption of [14C] alkylated glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle to condensed monolayers of phosphatidic acid was investigated under a variety of conditions. 2. The rate constant for association at 20 degrees C depended on ionic strength. At I/2=60mM the rate constant was 0.39min-1. At I/2=260mM it decreased to 0.27min-1. 3. The apparent association constant (Kass.) for adsorption at I/2=60mM was 1.06 X 10(6)M-1 and was strongly influenced by subphase changes in pH and ionic strength. Measurements of Kass. at 20 degrees and 5 degrees C gave a value for the apparent enthalpy change on adsorption of -33kJ-mol-1. Calculations of the apparent change in free energy  and apparent entropy change for the adsorption process gave values of -34kJ-mol-1 and +2J-K-1-mol-1 respectively. 4. Decreasing the amount of phosphatidic acid in the monolayer by replacement with phosphatidylcholine caused the shape of the adsorption isotherm to change from apparent hyperbolic to sigmoid. Subphase changes in pH or ionic strength did not affect the shape of the adsorption isotherm. However, adsorption of enzyme on monolayers of 100% phosphatidic acid in the presence of 1mM-CaCl2 was sigmoid in nature. 5. It is concluded that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase binds to condensed charged monolayers by multiple electrostatic interactions. At low concentrations of phosphatidic acid in the monolayer or in the presence of Ca2+, this occurs in a two-step process and depends on lateral diffusion of phosphatidic acid for strong binding to take place.\n",
      "Blood pH and PaCO2 as chemical factors in myocardial blood flow control. The effect of metabolic and hypercapnic acidosis on myocardial blood flow was studied during intravenous infusions of hydrochloric acid solutions (n = 12) and during passive ventilation with 5% CO2 (n = 5) in anaesthetized, closed chest dogs. Below a pH of 7.2 metabolic acidosis at normal arterial CO2-tensions caused an increase of coronary blood flow and a decrease of coronary vascular resistance associated with a narrowed myocardial arteriovenous O2-difference, indicating vasodilation at unchanged myocardial oxygen consumption. In propranolol-pretreated dogs myocardial blood flow and coronary oxygen AV difference remained unaffected, suggesting that the coronary dilatory effect of metabolic acidemia involves beta adrenergic stimulation. Coronary vasodilation induced by increasing arterial pCO2 was found to the significantly greater as compared with the dilatory effect of metabolic acidosis at the same blood pH level. Blocking of beta receptors did not reduce the coronary response to increased arterial CO2-tensions. It is concluded that the coronary vasodilation observed during hypercapnic acidosis is neither mediated by a beta adrenergic stimulation nor dependent of the concomitant change in blood pH. The possible sites of the coronary dilatory actions of increased arterial CO2-tensions are discussed.\n",
      "Enzymic hydrolysis of acetylcarnitine in liver from rats, sheep and cows. 1. The enzymic utilization of O-acetyl-l-carnitine other than via carnitine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.7) was investigated in liver homogenates from rats, sheep and dry cows. 2. An enzymic utilization of O-acetyl-l-carnitine via hydrolysis of the ester bond to yield stoicheiometric quantities of acetate and l-carnitine was demonstrated; 0.55, 0.53 and 0.30mumol of acetyl-l-carnitine were utilized/min per g fresh wt. of liver homogenates from rats, sheep and dry cows respectively. 3. The acetylcarnitine hydrolysis activity was not due to a non-specific esterase or non-specific cholinesterase. O-Acetyl-d-carnitine was not utilized. 4. The activity was associated with the enriched outer mitochondrial membrane fraction from rat liver. Isolation of this fraction resulted in an eightfold purification of acetylcarnitine hydrolase activity. 4. The K(m) for this acetylcarnitine utilization was 2mm and 1.5mm for rat and sheep liver homogenates respectively. 6. There was a significant increase in acetylcarnitine hydrolase in rats on starvation and cows on lactation and a significant decrease in sheep that were severely alloxan-diabetic. 7. The physiological role of an acetylcarnitine hydrolase is discussed in relation to coupling with carnitine acetyltransferase for the relief of ;acetyl pressure'.\n",
      "Creatine kinase equilibrium and lactate content compared with muscle pH in tissue samples obtained after isometric exercise. Muscle biopsies taken from the musculus quadriceps femoris of man were analysed for pH, ATP, ADP, AMP, creatine phosphate, creatine, lactate and pyruvate. Biopsies were taken at rest, after circulatory occlusion and after isometric contraction. Muscle pH decreased from 7.09 at rest to 6.56 after isometric exercise to fatigue. Decrease in muscle pH was linearly related to accumulation of lactate plus pyruvate. An increase of 22mumol of lactate plus pyruvate per g of muscle resulted in a fall of 0.5pH unit. The apparent equilibrium constant of the creatine kinase reaction (apparent K(CK)) increased after isometric contraction and a linear relationship between log(apparent K(CK)) and muscle pH was obtained. The low content of creatine phosphate in muscle after contraction as analysed from needle-biopsy samples is believed to be a consequence of an altered equilibrium state of the creatine kinase reaction. This in turn is attributed mainly to a change in intracellular pH.\n",
      "The microbial metabolism of acetophenone. Metabolism of acetophenone and some chloroacetophenones by an Arthrobacter species. 1. An organism that utilizes acetophenone as sole source of carbon and energy was isolated in pure culture and tentatively identified as an Arthrobacter sp. 2. Cell-free extracts of the acetophenone-grown organism contained an enzyme, acetophenone oxygenase, that catalysed an NADPH-dependent consumption of O(2) in the presence of the growth substrate; approx. 1mol of O(2) and 1mol of NADPH were consumed per mol of acetophenone oxidized. 3. Cell-free extracts also contained an enzyme capable of the hydrolysis of phenyl acetate to phenol and acetate. The amount of this esterase was increased markedly by growth on acetophenone. 4. The observed products of the acetophenone oxygenase reaction by crude cell-free extracts were phenol and acetate. However, inhibition of the phenyl acetate esterase by paraoxon resulted in the formation of phenyl acetate from acetophenone. 5. A degradative sequence is proposed in which acetophenone is metabolized by an oxygen-insertion reaction to form phenyl acetate. Further metabolism occurs by hydrolysis of this ester. 6. The organism and extracts were shown to metabolize chlorinated acetophenones. The environmental implications of this observation are discussed.\n",
      "Permeability to calcium of pigeon erythrocyte 'ghosts' studied by using the calcium-activated luminescent protein, obelin. 1. Obelin, the Ca(2+)-activated luminescent protein from the hydroid Obelia geniculata, was sealed inside pigeon erythrocyte ;ghosts' in order to investigate effects on their permeability of different methods of preparation and of the bivalent cation ionophore A23187. 2. Changes in free Ca(2+) within the ;ghosts' were studied by following the rate of luminescence of obelin. The possibility that the obelin might have been released from the ;ghosts' during an experiment was investigated by studying the release of inulin and pyruvate kinase from the ;ghosts'. Less than 10% of the inulin or pyruvate kinase sealed within the ;ghosts' was released under any of the experimental conditions. 3. Triton X-100 (0.1-10%, v/v) made the ;ghosts' highly permeable to Ca(2+). In the presence of 1mm-Ca(2+) and Triton, 95-100% of the obelin was utilized within 10-20s. 4. A time-course of resealing ;ghosts' at 37 degrees C showed that over a period of 90min, the ;ghosts' became gradually less permeable to Ca(2+). ;Ghosts' which remained at 0 degrees C retained only a small concentration of obelin and ATP, and were highly permeable to Ca(2+). 5. Erythrocyte ;ghosts' resealed for 30min at 20 degrees C rather than 37 degrees C were more permeable to Ca(2+), as shown by the fact that 92% of the obelin in the ;ghosts' was utilized during the first 60s after the addition of 1mm-Ca(2+), as opposed to 44% for ;ghosts' resealed at 37 degrees C. 6. Haemolysis at pH6.0 rather than 7.0 resulted in ;ghosts' which were highly permeable to Ca(2+) after resealing for 60min at 37 degrees C. Of the obelin in the ;ghosts', produced by haemolysis at pH6.0, 90% was utilized in the first 60s after the addition of 1mm-Ca(2+) compared with 23% for ;ghosts' produced at pH7.0. 7. The bivalent cation ionophore A23187 increased the permeability of the ;ghosts' to Ca(2+). Maximum effects of the ionophore (16mug/ml) were obtained by preincubating the ;ghosts' with the ionophore A23187 (16mug/ml) in the presence of a low concentration of Mg(2+) and in the absence of Ca(2+).\n",
      "The action of tributyltin on energy coupling in coupling-factor-deficient submitochondrial particles. 1. Tributyltin at concentrations of approx. 1nmol/mg of protein induces respiratory control and lessens the protein permeability of coupling-factor-deficient submitochondrial particles. 2. At these concentrations or lower, it increases the P/O ratio of the particles to a small extent and inhibits the adenosine triphosphatase activity without greatly increasing its sensitivity to uncoupling agents. 3. It fails to stimulate ATP-driven reversed electron transport or transhydrogenase, but stimulates the transhydrogenase driven by aerobic succinate oxidation. 4. The results indicate that, unlike oligomycin, tributyltin does not discriminate between damaged and intact ATP-synthesizing complexes. 5. The relationship between the oligomycin- and tributyltin-binding sites is discussed.\n",
      "Effects of the cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent metoprolol in angina pectoris. Subacute study with exercise tests. The effect of a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, metoprolol, on symptoms and exercise tolerance was studied in 16 patients with angina pectoris. Metroprolol was compared with placebo at two dose levels (20 mg t.d.s. and 50 mg t.d.s.) in a double-blind trial in 14 patients. Compared with placebo, metroprolol caused a significant reduction of heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise, and consequently a reduction of the rate-pressure product. The reduction was greater with 50 mg t.d.s. than with 20 mg t.d.s. The exercise tolerance measured as total work increased significantly by 21 per cent during treatment with metroprolol 20 mg t.d.s., and by 17 per cent during treatment with 50 mg t.d.s. There was a reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption, and subjective improvement of angina pectoris at both dose levels of metroprolol. No signs of cardiac failure appeared during any of the four treatment periods. Heart volume showed no significant change. Unwanted effects were of the same frequency and severity during treatment with metroprolol at both dose levels as with placebo.\n",
      "The availability of folates in man: effect of orange juice supplement on intestinal conjugase. The mechanisms of the low availability of endogenous folates in orange juice and the inhibitory effects on the availability of pteroylheptaglutamate (PteGlu7) caused by orange juice supplements were investigated in man by the use of simulated orange juice (containing the principal components: citric acid, malic acid, etc.) with several different pHs. The endogenous folates in orange juice were identified as mainly 5-methyl reduced derivatives of pteroylpolyglutamates (40-45% pentaglutamate, 10-15% tetraglutamate, 30-40% monoglutamate, and the rest were tri-and diglutamates). The availability of PteGlu7 is decreased to 54% by supplementation with 600 g concentrated orange juice (pH 3.7) and to 39% and 66% by the supplement of 24 g and 12 g citric acid (pH 3.7), respectively. Neutralization of 12 g citric acid to pH 6.4 largely reverses the inhibitory effect. On the other hand, the availability of pteroylmonoglutamate (PteGlu) is not influenced by a supplement of orange juice or citric acid. The results suggest that the low availability of PteGlu7 is due to the inhibition of intestinal conjugase caused by the low pH. These observations suggest that pH of foodstuffs may be an important factor in the absorption of polyglutamate forms of folate.\n",
      "The use of a single venous blood sample to assess oxygen binding in haemoglobin. The measurement of pH, PO2, PCO2 and SO2 in a single venous blood sample can be used to determine the P50 at standard or at in vivo conditions. This technique makes it feasible for a physician, firstly, to make an assessment of the net adaptation of the red cell to reductions in blood oxygen content or flow and, secondly, to make an initial assessment of whether a haemoglobin with altered affinity for oxygen is present in subjects with polycythaemia or anaemia.\n",
      "The state of energization of the membrane of Escherichia coli as affected by physiological conditions and colicin K. The bacterial protein colicin K, when added to sensitive Escherichia coli in the presence of 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine, cuases a doubling in fluorescence of the probe. Glucose and oxygen cause a decreased fluorescence while anoxia and cyanide cause a rise in fluorescence. These results in conjunction with the work of other laboratories suggest that colicin K causes a depolarization of the transmembrane electrical potential. Fluorescence in the absence of colicin K was relatively independent of KCl, NaCl, and MgCl2 concentrations below 0.1 M. Although colicin K caused rapid efflux of the K+ analogue 86Rb+, the fluorescence rise was only partially blocked by 0.13 M KCl. The level of fluorescence caused by the action of colcin K was inversely proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of MgCl2 over the range of 2 muM to 4 mM. This suggests that a Nernst electrochemical potential for an anion can counteract a membrane depolarization caused by colcin. After colcin K action, the fluorescence of the carbocyanine could be further increased by anoxia or cyanide. The distribution of the weak base dimethyloxazolidinedione indicated that the pH in the interior of aerobic E. coli supplied with lactate was alkaline by 0.1 unit and unaffected by colicin. These results suggest that colicin K does not completely depolarize the membrane potential and does not interfere with the component of membrane energization generated by electron transport. Colicin K does not act as a cationophore. The partial depolarization of the membrane may account for the inhibition of active solute transport caused by colicin K.\n",
      "The acid-catalyzed decompostion of phenacylcobalamin: evidence for the formation of an enol-Co(III) pi-complex intermediate. Phenacylcobalamin has been synthesized and characterized by thin-layer chromatography and uv-visible spectroscopy, as well as identification of the cobalt-containing and organic products of its cleavage in acid and base and by aerobic photolysis. The major organic product from all three cleavage reactions is acetophenone and the cobalt-containing product is aquacobalamin (or hydroxocobalamin, its conjugate base). In aqueous acidic solution (pH 0 to 7.3, ionic strength 1.0 M, and 25.0 degrees C), the kinetics of the formation of aquacobalamin are biphasic representing the linear sum of two exponential terms. The pH dependence of the first-order rate constant of both phases shows a first-order dependence on proton concentration but with an inflection point ot pH 3.55 for the faster phase and at pH 4.03 for the slower phase. This behavior is interpreted in terms of the specific acid catalyzed formation of an intermediate from both \"base on\" and \"base off\" phenacylcobalamin with different second-order rate constants for each form, followed by an intermediate decompotion step with a similar formal mechanism. The nature of the intermediate is discussed and it is concluded to be a pi-complex between cob(III)alamin and the enol of acetophenone.\n",
      "A quantitative treatment of the kinetics of the folding transition of ribonuclease A. New experimental data and a quantitative theoretical treatment are given for the kinetics of the thermal folding transition of ribonuclease A at pH 3.0. A three-species mechanism is used as a starting point for the analysis: U1 (slow) in equilibrium U2(fast) in equilibrium N, where U1 and U2 are two forms of the unfolded enzyme with markedly different rates of refolding and N is the native enzyme. This mechanism is based on certain facts established in previous studies of refolding. The kinetics of unfolding and refolding show two phases a fast phase and a slow phase, over a range of temperatures extending above the transition midpoint, Tm. The three-species mechanism can be used in this range. At higher temperatures a new much faster kinetic phase is also observed corresponding to the transient formation of a new intermediate (I). Although the general solution for a four-species mechanism is complex it is not difficult to extend the three-species analysis for the special case found here, in which the fast reaction (I in equilibrium N) is well separated from the other two reactions. At temperatures below the transition zone the slow phase of refolding becomes kinetically complex. No attempt has been made to extend the analysis to include this effect. The basic test of the three-state analysis is the prediction as a function of temperature of alpha2, the relative amplitude of the fast phase, both for unfolding and refolding. At temperatures above Tm for which the three-state analysis must be extended to include the new intermediate I, a crresponding quanitity alpha2(cor) is predicted and compared with measured values. Data used in the three-state prediction are values of tau2 and tau1, the time constants of the fast and slow kinetic phases, plus a single value of alpha2 measured when tau2 and tau1 are well separated. The observed and predicted values of alpha2 agree within experimental error. The analysis predicts correctly that, for these experiments, alpha2 should have the same value in unfolding as in refolding in the final conditions. The analysis also predicts satisfactorily the equilibrium transition curve from kinetic data alone. Four striking properties of the kinetics are  explained or correlated by the analysis: (a) the drop in alpha2 to a minimum near Tm as well as the delayed rise in alpha2 above Tm;(b) the vanishing of alpha1 above the transition zone; (c) the sharp drop in tau1 inside the transition zone followed by a partial leveling off outside this zone; and (d) the passage of tau2 through a maximum near Tm. Through a comparison of observed and predicted values of alpha2, the analysis also rules out the alternative three-species mechanism U1 (slow) in equilibrium N (fast) in equilibrium U2. Finally, the temperature dependence of the amplitude for the fast reaction (I in equilibrium N) is discussed; the behavior of I is like that of U2 and I may be an unfolded species populated at equilibrium...\n",
      "Rate enhancement specificity with alpha-chymotrypsin: temperature dependence of deacylation. The relative rate of the hydrolysis of 2-(5-n-alkyl)furoyl-alpha-chymotrypsin reaches a maximum with the propyl derivative. The Arrhenius plots for the hydrolyses of the 2-furoyl-, 2-(5-ethyl)furoyl-, and 2-(5-n-propyl)furoyl-alpha-chymotrypsins display a discontinuity, while the plots obtained with the ramaining furoyl derivatives 5-methyl, 5-n-butyl, and 5-n-amyl are linear. We conclude that the deacylation of the furoyl derivatives of alpha-chymotrypsin involves a minimum of two elementary reaction steps. Depending upon the reaction conditions, rate enhancement specificity appears to be either entropy or enthalpy controlled.\n",
      "Optimal conditions and specificity of interaction of a distinct class of nonhistone chromosomal proteins with DNA. A subclass of nonhistone chromatin proteins with high DNA affinity has been isolated from rat liver. The interaction of the isolated proteins with DNA in vitro was characterized utilizing a nitrocellulose filter binding technique. The temperature, time, concentration, ionic strength, and pH dependence were characterized. Optimal interaction was observed at 0.19 M naCl, pH 7.5 with a protein to DNA ratio of 13 (w/w). Equilibrium and kinetic competition experiments indicated that these proteins interact optimally with A-T rich and single-stranded DNA. The data also suggest that these proteins might affect the helixcoil transiton of DNA.\n",
      "The subcellular distribution of adenylate and guanylate cyclases in murine lymphoid cells. Membrane vesicles can be prepared from murine lymphoid cells by nitrogen cavitation and fractionated by sedimentation through nonlinear sucrose density gradients. Two subpopulations of membrane vesicles, PMI and PMII, can be distinguished on the basis of sedimentation rate. The subcellular distribution of adenylate and guanylate cyclases in these membrane subpopulations have been compared with the distribution of a number of marker enzymes. Approximately 20-30% of the total adenylate and guanylate cyclase activity is located at the top of the sucrose gradient (soluble enzyme), the remainder of the activity being distributed in the PMI and PMII fractions (membrane-bound enzyme). More than 90% of the 5'-nucleotidase and NADH oxidase activities detected in lymphoid cell homogenates are located in PMI and PMII fractions, whereas succinate cytochrome c reductase activity is detected only in the PMII fractions. In addition, beta-galactosidase activity is distributed in the soluble and PMII fractions of the sucrose density gradients. On the basis of the fractionation patterns of these various enzyme activities, it appears that PMI fractions contain vesicles of plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, whereas PMII fractions contain mitochondria, lysomes, and plasma membrane vesicles. Approximately 30-40% of the adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities in PMII can be converted to a PMI-like form following dialysis and resedimentation through a second nonlinear sucrose gradient. Adenylate and guanulate cyclases can be distinguished on the basis of sensitivity to nonionic detergents.\n",
      "Fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance study of fluorotyrosine alkaline phosphatase: the influence of zinc on protein structure and a conformational change induced by phosphate binding. 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used to study a fully active E. coli fluorotyrosine alkaline phosphatase. The fluorotyrosine resonances provide sensitive probes of the conformational states of the protein. They were used to follow the addition of zinc or cobalt to the apoprotein, and the titration of the protein with inorganic phosphate or the inhibitor 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzylphosphonate. The results indicate that 2 molecules of inorganic phosphate per dimer of alkaline phosphatase are required to complete a general conformational change in the protein involving perturbations to the environment of several tyrosines. Spectra of the cobalt enzyme indicate that on specific tyrosine per subunit may be near the metal site. The 19F NMR results, combined with the 31P NMR results in the accompanying paper, lead directly to the conclusion  that dissociation of noncovalently bound inorganic phosphate from the enzyme is the rate-limiting process in enzyme catalysis at high pH. The local environment of the individual fluorotyrosines is also discussed.\n",
      "31P nuclear magnetic resonance study of alkaline phosphatase: the role of inorganic phosphate in limiting the enzyme turnover rate at alkaline pH. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to directly observe the binding of inorganic phosphate to alkaline phosphatase. Evidencq for the tight binding of 1.5-2.0 mol of inorganic phosphate per dimer of alkaline phosphatase is presented. Two distinct forms of bound phosphate are observed, one predominating above pH 7 and representing the non-covalent E-P1 complex and the other predominating below pH 5 and representing the covalent E-P1 complex. The 31P NMR line width of the E-P1 complex indicates that the dissociation of noncovalent phosphate is the rate-limiting step in the turnover of the enzyme at high pH.\n",
      "An analysis of the autophosphorylation of rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes. The autophosphorylation of rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes has been studied under various experimental conditions. The phosphopeptides of the erythocyte membranes were identified using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis followed by ratioautography. The pattern of phosphorylatiion of membrane components differs with respect to the phosphoryl donor used (ATP or GTP) and to the pH at which the reaction is carried out. Both species appear to contain at least two distinct membrane-bound protein kinases. The human erythrocyte membrane contains a cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase and several substrates for this kinase. Only ATP can be used as a phosphoryl donor for this kinase. In contrast, the rabbit erythrocyte membrane does not contain a cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase but does contain a kinase which utilizes only ATP as the phosphoryl donor and is specific for certain endogenous substrates at low pH. Both the human and  rabbit erythrocyte membranes contain a kinase which utilizes GTP, perhaps also ATP, as the phosphoryl donor. The substrates of these kinases are similar in both species.\n",
      "Glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase from Escherichia coli: purification and physical and chemical properties. The glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.42), WHIch catalyzes the adenylylation and deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase in E. coli, has been stabilized and purified 2200-fold to apparent homogeneity. Sedimentation and electrophoresis studies show that the native enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of 115,000 +/- 5000 molecular weight with an isoelectric pH (PL) OF 4.98, a sedimentation coefficient (S20.w0) of 5.6S, and a molar frictional coefficient (f/f0) of 1.52. An alpha-helical content of approximately equal to 25% and approximately equal to 28% beta-pleated sheet and approximately equal to 47% random coil structures were estimated from circular dichroism measurements. The amino acid composition of the protein has been determined. The intrinsic tryptophanyl residue flourescence of adenylyltransferase is two fold greater than that of L-tryptophan; this property has been used to monitor ligand-induced conformational changes in the enzyme. Activators of the adenylylation reaction (ATP, L-glutamine, or the E. coli PII regulatory protein) produced an enhancement of fluorescence; alpha-ketoglutarate, an inhibitor of adenylylation and an activator of deadenulylation, caused a net decrease in fluorescence. The adenylytransferase has separate interaction sites for L-glutamine and the regulatory PII protein.\n",
      "The esterification of dolichol by rat liver microsomes. The incubation of 1-[3H)dolichols with cell-free preparations from various rat tissues resulted in the formation of a labeled material which possessed the characteristics of synthetic dolichol palmitate. Rat liver microsomes were found to be a good source of the acyltransferase activity, and the properties of the reaction were investigated using microsomal preparations. The reaction did not require ATP, CoA, or Mg2+ and was stimulated by the addition of phosphatidylcholine. The esterification of dolichol appears to be similar to the esterification of retinol. The fact that the esterification of dolichol is not depressed even in the presence of a several-fold excess of retinol is evidence that the two reactions are catalyzed by different enzymes.\n",
      "Preparation of Fv fragment from the mouse myeloma XRPC-25 immunoglobulin possessing anti-dinitrophenyl activity. The myeloma IgA protein produced by plasmacytoma XRPC-25, was isolated by affinity chromatography on dinitrophenyllysine-Sepharose. The affinity constant of the intact protein or its Fab' toward 2,4-dinitrophenyl-L-lysine (Dnp) was found to be 2.6 X 10(5) M-1. In order to prepare an Fv fragment (Hochman, J., Inbar, D., and Givol, D. (1973), Biochemistry 12, 1130) from this protein, the heavy and light chains were separated and the light chain was digested with trypsin at pH 8.2 to yield half a light chain. This digest was reassociated with the heavy chain and the recombinant was digested with papain at pH 5.7. Fractionation of this digest on a Sephadex G-75 column and Dnp-lysine-Sepharose resulted in the isolation of an Fv fragment which possesses one binding site for Dnplysine (Ka = 2.0 X 10(5) M-1). The active Fv fragment has a molecular weight of 23,400 and is composed of two peptide chains, each having a molecular weight of approximately 12,000. The N-terminal residues of these chains are aspartic and glutamic acids, which are also N-terminal in the heavy and light chains, indicating that the Fv is composed of VL and VH.\n",
      "Purification and properties of a low molecular weight protein factor of mitochondrial energy-linked functions. 1. A soluble protein with a molecular weight of 11-12-10(3) has been isolated from bovine-heart mitochondria, which stimulates the following ATP-dependent reactions of submitochondrial particles treated with 0.6 mM EDTA and 1 M NH4OH: reverse electron transfer from succinate to NAD, transhydrogenation from NADH to NADP, and ATP-Pi exchange. The factor has no effect on the NADH oxidase, succinate oxidase and ATPase activities of the particles. 2. The stimulatory effect of the factor in the ATP-dependent reduction of NAD by succinate is 12 mumol-min-1-mg-1 of the factor protein. However, the NH4OH-EDTA treated particles are saturated for maximal activation of the above reaction by very small amounts of the factor (about 20-40 mug factor per mg particle). 3. Electrophoresis of the factor preparation on polyacrylamide gels showed a single protein band plus a nonprotein material which moved at the dye front and was weakly stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein was shown to be required for activation of the particles; whether the fast-moving, nonprotein material is also required is not known. 4. The factor is inhibited by mercurials and N-ethylmaleimide. The former, but not the latter, inhibition is completely reversed by 1,4-dithiothreitol. 5. The NH4OH-EDTA treated particles are also stimulated by rutamycin up to about 0.1 nmol of rutamycin per mg particle; higher rutamycin concentrations inhibit. Depending on the particle preparation, the factor stimulates up to about 3 nmol per mg particle, but does not inhibit at higher concentrations. In addition, under certain conditions in which appropriate concentrations of rutamycin fail to stimulate the particles, the factor still does.\n",
      "Effect of the transmembrane electric field on the photochemical and quenching properties of photosystem II in vivo. The intermediate phase of fluorescence relaxation (lms-ls) (Joliot, P., Joliot, A., Bouges, B, and Barbieri, G. (1971) Photochem. Photobiol. 14, 287-305), following a single saturating flash, is shown to be controlled by a slow phase of the reoxidation of Q- by a secondary acceptor and, in vivo, by the transmembrane electric field. The kinetics of reoxidation of Q- are slowed by lowering the pH. This slowing effect is interpreted in terms of the reversible formation at low pH of QH which is not oxidizable by the secondary acceptor. The electric field transforms Photosystem II centers into a non-quenching photochemically inactive state that cannot be attributed to an accumulation of Q-. Centers are unequally sensitive to the field. A critical field strength can be defined for each center above which that center is blocked and below which the center is photochemically active. The transformation from the active to inactive state occurs over a narrow range of field strength. Sensitive centers are blocked by the field in less than 1 ms and become active again in less than 10 ms as the field strength falls. Two hypotheses are proposed for the mechanism of blockage of centers by the field: (1) a field induced conformational change in the centers, (2) the formation or suppression of a dipole critical to the function of a center. The activity of the ATP synthetase, determining the rate of relaxation of the field, was controlled by a light-dark treatment or by a chemical method using p-benzoquinone.\n",
      "Determination of H+/e- ratios in chloroplasts with flashing light. Using a rapid pH electrode, measurements were made of the flash-induced proton transport in isolated spinach chloroplasts. To calibrate the system, we assumed that in the presence of ferricyanide and in steady-state flashing light, each flash liberates from water one proton per reaction chain. We concluded that with both ferricyanide and methylviologen as acceptors two protons per electron are translocated by the electron transport chain connecting Photosystem II and I. With methyl viologen but not with ferricyanide as an acceptor, two additional protons per electron are taken up due to Photosystem I activity. One of these latter protons is translocated to the inside of the thylakoid while the other is taken up in H2O2 formation. Assuming that the proton released during water splitting remains inside the thylakoid, we compute H+/e- ratios of 3 and 4 for ferricyanide and methylviologen, respectively. In continuous light of low intensity, we obtained the same H+/e- ratios. However, with higher intensities where electron transport becomes rate limited by the internal pH, the H+/e- ratio approached 2 as a limit for both acceptors. A working model is presented which includes two sites of proton translocation, one between the photoacts, the other connected to Photosystem I, each of which translocates two protons per electron. Each site presents a approximately 30 ms diffusion barrier to proton passage which can be lowered by uncouplers to 6-10 ms.\n",
      "[Study of the mechanism of the effect of extracellular pH on the synthesis of the oxidative complex (cytochrome a+a3) of Bacillus coagulans: relationship to the \"glucose effect\" and role of excreted coproporphyrin III (author's transl)]. During the \"respiratory adaptation\" of Bacillus coagulans, it was possible to dissociate the kinetics of cytochrome a and a3 synthesis with carbon monoxide. The synthesis of cytochrome a3 is preferentially repressed when the pH of the incubation medium is pH 6.5 instead of pH 5.5. However, though the total synthesis of tetrapyrrole compounds is the same at both pH values, the excretion of coproporphyrin III is much increased at pH 6.5. Bacillus coagulans, sensitive to the \"glucose effect\", shows the \"pH effect\" only in the presence of high glucose concentrations. The repression of the oxidase complex synthesis by a slight increase of the extracellular pH appears directly related to the increase of the extracellular coproporphyrin III.\n",
      "The effect of retinol and retinoic acid on the testicular phospholipase a activity in retinol-deficient rats. Both phospholipases A1 and A2 activities (EC 3.1.1.4) at pH 7.4 were found to be significantly decreased in retinol-deficient rat testes supplemented with retinoic acid as compared to retinol-fed controls using 1-acyl-2-[1-(14)C]-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as substrate. However, little or no difference was observed in phospholipase A1 activity at pH 3.0 in both groups of rats.\n",
      "Enzymatic properties of cloacin DF13 and kinetics of ribosome inactivation. 1. The cloacin DF13-induced inactivation of ribosomes in vitro can be described as an enzyme-catalyzed reaction according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Most probably the cloacin acts as a unique endoribonuclease. 2. At pH 7.8 and 37 degrees C the Km value for the reaction of cloacin DF13 with ribosomes is 13.2 - 10(-6) M. If under these conditions the reaction mixture is supplemented with all components necessary for protein synthesis, the Km changes to 17.7 - 10(-6) M. 3. The in vitro activity of cloacin DF13 has a temperature optimum of 43 degrees C at pH 7.8 and a pH optimum of 8.4 at 37 degtees C. 4. Experiments with cloacin DF13-immunity protein as an inhibitor of the cloacin activity in vitro have indicated that the immunity protein might be considered as a non-competitive and virtually \"irreversible\" inhibitor.\n",
      "Transfer RNA methyltransferase activity in paramecium aurelia. The tRNA methyltransferases from Paramecium aurelia were investigated. The effects of varying the Mg2+ and NH4+ concentrations, pH, and temperature on the methylation of Escherichia coli B tRNA using extracts from P. aurelia were determined. Optimum tRNA methyltransferase activity was observed at pH 7.8 and 37 degrees C. The Mg2+ optimum occurred at 0.66 mM in the absence of NH4+ while the NH4+ optimum occurred at 100 mM in the absence of Mg2+. Analysis of the bases methylated in (E. coli B) tRNA by extracts of P. aurelia showed the presence of 1-methyladenine, 1-methylguanine, N2-methylguanine, N2,N2-dimethylguanine and methylated pyrimidine nucleotides. In comparison, an analysis of the in vivo methylation of tRNA from P. aurelia showed the presence of 1-methyladenine, 6-methyladenine, 6,6-dimethyladenine, 1-methylguanine, N2-methylguanine, N2,N2-dimethylguanine, 7-methylguanine, and methylated pyrimidine nucleotides. The pattern of methylation of tRNA in P. aurelia is similar to that observed in other eukaryotes.\n",
      "The effect of silver ion binding and pH on the buoyant density of DNA and its use in fractionating heterogeneous DNA. 1. The effect of pH on the buoyant density of the complexes of Ag+ with DNA has been studied using 3H-labeled human DNA and several bacterial DNAs to determine the conditions necessary for the maximum resolution of compositional heterogeneity. In neutral CS2SO4 density gradients, Ag+ complexes with (G - C)-rich components are always denser than those with (A - T)-rich components, since (G - C)rich DNAs have a larger affinity for Ag+ than (A - T)-rich DNAs and their complexes are denser than (A - T)-rich complexes. In alkaline (pH greater than 9) CS2SO4 gradients, the buoyant density of the Ag+ - DNA complex is not a simple function of base composition. The Ag+ affinity of (A - T)-rich DNA is larger than that of (G - C)-rich DNA but the density of a (G - C)-rich complex is larger. Thus the ordering of the buoyant density changes depends on the amount of added Ag+. 2. The problem of resolving the density heterogeneity within a tracer DNA, and minor components of DNA, is explored and useful fractionation techniques are developed.\n",
      "Comparison of purple membrane from Halobacterium cutirubrum and Halobacterium halabium. Direct comparison of purple membrane preparations from Halobacterium cutirubrum and Halobacterium halobium was carried out. Both preparations were found to be essentially identical with respect to their molecular weight, retinal content, lipid composition, fingerprinting of peptides from peptide digestion, electron micrographs and X-ray diffraction patterns, and behaviour as a light-activated proton pump. Thus, there would appear to be no species differences in the purple membranes from these two bacteria.\n",
      "Kinetics of ion translocation across charged membranes mediated by a two-site transport mechanism. Effects of polyvalent cations upon rubidium uptake into yeast cells. (1) The effect of surface charge upon the kinetics of monovalent cation translocation via a two-site mechanism is investigated theroretically. (2) According to the model dealt with, typical relations are expected for the dependence of the kinetic parameters of the translocation process upon the concentration of a polyvalent cation, differing essentially from those derived for the case in which the membrane carries no excess charge. (3) Even when a polyvalent cation does not compete with the substrate cation for binding to the translocation sites, apparently competitive inhibition may occur when the membrane is negatively charged. (4) The model is tested experimentally by studying the effects of the polyvalent cations Mg2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, Ba2+ and Al3+ upon Rb+ uptake into yeast cells at pH 4.5 A good applicability is found. (5) Equimolar concentrations of polyvalent cations reduce the rate of the Rb+ uptake into yeast cells in the order Mg2+ less than Sr2+ less than Ca2+ less than Ba2+ less than Al3+. (6) The conclusion is reached that the reduction in the rate of Rb+ uptake caused by the polyvalent cations applied results mainly from screening of the negative fixed charges on the membrane surface and binding to these negative sites rather than competition with Rb+ for the transport sites. (7) The results of our investigation indicate the affinity of the alkaline-earth cations for the negative fixed charges on the surface to the yeast cell membrane increases in the orther Mg2+ less than Sr2 less than Ca2+ less than Ba2+. (8) Probably mainly phosphoryl groups determine the net charge on the membrane of the yeast cell at a medium pH of 4.5.\n",
      "The structure of monellin and its relation to the sweetness of the protein. The sweet protein monellin [1-3] has been shown to consist of two non-identical subunits of 50 and 42 amino acid residues, which were separated electrophoretically and chromatographically. Automatic sequential Edman degradation gave the complete sequence of the longer subunit, and a partial sequency of the shorter one. It was found that the sweetness of monellin requires the undissociated molecule. The individual subunits were not sweet, neither did they block the sweet sensation of sucrose or monellin. Blocking of the single SH of monellin abolished its sweetness as did reaction of the single methionyl residue with CNBr. Since the cysteinyl and methionyl residues appear to be adjacent, it is suggested that this part of the molecule is essential for its sweetness.\n",
      "Anomalous fluorescence of yeast 3-phosphoglucerate kinase. The 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) of yeast which contains two tryptophyl and eight tyrosyl residues per molecule, displayed an unusualy fluorescence emission spectrum with a maximum at 308 nm when excited at 280 nm. The emission peak shifted to 329 nm when excited at 295 nm. We could confirm that it was due to the efficient quenching of tryptophyl fluorescence as well as to the incomplete energy transfer from tyrosyl to tryptophyl residues. The average fluorescence quantum yield of this protein was 0.076 (excitation at 280 nm) and that of tryptophyl residues was 0.046 (excitation at 295 nm). As the pH of the solution was lowered, the fluorescence intensity of phosphoglycerate kinase at 329 nm dramatically increased between pH 5 and 4, while the position of the peak remained unchanged. When denatured in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, the protein showed two emission peaks, one at 343 nm and the other at 303 nm.\n",
      "Binding of norgestrel to human plasma proteins. Binding of [14, 15-3H](+/-)-norgestrel to human plasma proteins has been investigated. Norgestrel showed greater affinity to plasma than to human serum albumin indicating specific norgestrel binding protein(s) in the plasma. alpha1-acid glycoprotein showed high affinity for norgestrel when compared with human serum albumin. The binding protein was eluted at pH 5.8 by step by step elution on a DEAE-cellulose column. Norgestrel binding to plasma proteins was not affected at 60 degrees C. The optimal binding occurred between pH 7 and 8. Ligand specificity of the binding protein revealed that progesterone was able to compete for the norgestrel binding sites, whereas corticosterone, testosterone, oestradiol, and norethindrone acetate did not show much competition. The molecular weight of the binding protein was found to be approximately 43 000. Sucrose density gradient analysis indicated that norgestrel bound to a macromolecular component of sedimentation coefficient 2.9 S. The association constant (Kass) and dissociation constant (Kdiss) of norgestrel-binding plasma protein was found to be 1.4-10(6) M-1 and 0.7-10(-6) M respectively. The number of binding sites was 0.5-10(-9) mol/mg protein. Norgestrel-binding protein in the plasma appeared to be a protein different from human serum albumin, corticosteroid-binding globulin and sex-steroid-binding protein. This binding protein showed some similarities to alpha1-acid glycoprotein.\n",
      "Equilbrium and kinetics of the unfolding of alpha-lactalbumin by guanidine hydrochloride (II). The reversible unfolding of alpha-lactalbumin by guanidine hydrochloride, was studied at 25.0 degrees C in a relatively low concentration range of the denaturant (0.80-2.00 mol/l) by means of difference spectra and pH-jump measurements. The unfolding was shown to occur between two states, N and D, because apparent rate-constants of the unfolding and the refolding reactions depended only on pH. All curves plotted as the logarithmical equilibrium constant log KD against pH could fall on the same base curve by shifting each curve along the log KD axis. From the dependence of the logarithmic rate constant on pH, master curves could also be made for the forward and the backward reactions. The dependence of these master curves on pH indicates that the groups affecting the pH dependence of the unfolding are three residues with pKN = 3.3 and pKA = pKD = 4.4, one residue with pKN = pKA = 3.8 and pKD = 4.4, and one residue with pKN = 5.8 and pKA = pKD = 6.3, where A indicates the activated state. On the other hand, from the denaturant activity dependence of the shift factors required for making the master curves, the value of the intrinsic binding constant of the denaturant to the protein was found to be similar to that obtained from previous measurements at pH 5.5. Differences between the numbers of the binding sites of the denaturant on the denaturated and the native proteins, and between those on the activated and the native proteins were shown to be 5.3 and 2.1, respectively. The free energy of stabilization in the native-like environment also shows that the protein in the native state is more unstable than lysozyme.\n",
      "Fluorimetric studies of tryptophyl exposure in concanavalin A. Studies of the iodide ion quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of Concanavalin A indicate that 50% of the tryptophyl fluorescence originates from exposed residues. This agrees with the X-ray crystallographic determination that two of the four tryptophan residues in a Concanavalin A monomer are on the surface. Previous studies have indicated that conformational changes induced by sugar binding alter the environment of aromatic residues. The present investigation finds that neither the specific binding of alpha-methyl-D-mannoside nor alteration of the Concanavalin A quaternary structure changes the number or accessibility of the solvent-exposed tryptophan residues. It therefore appears that the major conformational transitions in Concanavalin A do not affect steric access to the surface tryptophans and the effects previously observed may be ascribed to structurally internal tryptophan residues.\n",
      "A study of Folch-Pi apoprotein. II. Relation between polymerization state and conformation. A comparison of the conformation of Folch-Pi apoprotein in organic solvent and in aqueous solutions has been made by ESR, infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies. Electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation have been carried out in order to correlate molecular weight and charge of the molecule with its conformation. It appears that the protein is monomeric in organic solution. In water, only one component is present but the molecules behave as a polydisperse system of associating molecules. Hydrophobic interacitons seem to be important for this polymerisation which does not appear to be accompanied by the formation of beta-structure. After the transfer of the protein from organic solution to water, the ESR spectra of the protein labelled on the free SH groups show an heterogeneity in the motional environment of the label which permits to assume that different areas of association exist in the polymeric molecule.\n",
      "Response of the glycolysis of human erythrocytes to the transition from the oxygenated to the deoxygenated state at constant intracellular pH. The time course of the rate of the glycolysis of human erythrocytes and of some metabolites were determined before and after rapid deoxygenation at constant intracellular pH. For this purpose stripped deoxygenated haemoglobin was used as a rapid oxygen acceptor. Deoxygenation causes an increase of the glycolytic rate by 26%. Glucose 6-phosphate is decreased while the adenine nucleotides and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate remain constant. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and the triose phosphates decrease transiently before rising. The data can be explained by increased binding of phosphocompounds to deoxygenated as compared with oxygenated haemoglobin. Thereby the control enzymes hexokinase and phosphofructokinase are influenced. It is concluded that under physiological conditions changes in the oxygenation state of haemoglobin per se alter the glycolytic rate.\n",
      "Intracellular pH of frog sartorius muscle. A weak base, morpholine, has been labelled with 3H and tested for its suitability as an indicator for intracellular pH, by distribution in the tissue water of frog sartorius muscle in the species Hyla litoria. Its pK'a at 20 degrees C in a solution of the same ionic strength as frog Ringer was found to be 8.45 +/- 0.02, which is in the range of maximal sensitivity. Morpholine equilibrated with the tissue in 17 h; it was shown that it was not bound to intracellular constituents, that it was not metabolised nor toxic in the concentrations used; it was therefore judged suitable as a pH indcator. Intracellular pH was then measured by distribution of morpholine (6.985 +/- 0.08), nicotine (6.915 +/- 0.03) and the weak acid 5,5'-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (7.10 +/- 0.05) and the pH-sensitive microelectrodes (5.9, the equilibrium value). It was shown that the four significantly different values could not be reconciled in terms of experimental error, heterogeneity of intracellular pH, liquid junction potential differences, or binding of indicator molecules inside the fibre. They could, however, be reconciled if the fibre water had different structure and solvent properties from the extracellular water and all ions were distributed across the membrane as between two liquid phases containing different solvents. Then the H+ would be in equilibrium, as shown by the microelectrode measurement, but intracellular pH would be indeterminable and probably greater than 6.\n",
      "Activation of murine lymphocytes by cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate: specificity and role in mitogen activity. Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) stimulates nucleic acid synthesis in lymphocytes, and has been implicated as the intracellular effector of the actions of mitogenic agents on these cells. In the present study, we examined the specificity of the mitogenic activity of cyclic GMP and of its 8-bromo (Br) derivatives, and the effects of the T cell mitogens, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and staphylococcal entertoxin B (SEB) on the cyclic GMP content and guanylate cyclase activity of mouse splenic lymphocytes. Cyclic GMP and guanosine modestly increased the incorporation of [3H] thymidine into DNA by cultured lymphocytes, but were far less effective than their 8-Br-guanosine and 8-Br-5'-GMP exceeded that of 8-Br-cyclic GMP, when tested in the presence and absence of serum in the culture media. Combined addition of maximal doses of these nucleotides did not give additive stimulatory effects, suggesting an action on a common subpopulation of cells, and possibly a common mechanism. By contrast, cyclic AMP, 8-Br-cyclic AMP, 8-Br-adenosine, cholera toxin and prostaglandin E1 suppressed both basal [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulation of this parameter by T-cell mitogens and the guanine nucleotides. Rapid effects of concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, SEB, guanosine, 5'-GMP, 8-Br-guanosine, and 8-Br-5'-GMP on the cyclic GMP content of murine lymphocytes could not be demonstrated. Similarly, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin and SEB failed to alter guanylate cyclase activity when added directly to cellular homogenates or pre-incubated with intact cells. Conversely, carbamylcholine rapidly increased lymphocyte cyclic GMP but was not mitogenic. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP are antagonistic in their influence on lymphocyte mitogenesis. However, they also demonstrate that related nucleotides are more potent mitogens than cyclic GMP itself and suggest that activation of murine lymphocytes by concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin and SEB may not be mediated by rapid increases in cellular cyclic GMP content. Since high concentrations of exogenous cyclic GMP and related nucleotides must be used to influence DNA synthesis, the biologic significance of this effect remains uncertain.\n",
      "Characterization of protein kinases from bovine parotid glands. The effect of tolbutamide and its derivative on these partially purified enzymes. 1. Four fractions of protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) activity (Peak IH, IIH, IIIC and IVC) have been resolved and partially purified from the 100 000 X g supernatant fraction of bovine parotid glands by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatographies. 2. The protein kinases of Peak IH and IIH were adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) -dependent and had similar enzymic properties. The enzyme activities of Peak IIIC and IVC were cyclic-AMP independent, but there were some distinct differences between their properties. The protein kinase in Peak IIIC was activated by 0.2 M NaCl or KCl and phosphorylated casein preferentially as the substrate, utilizing only ATP as a phosphate donor. On the other hand, the protein kinase in Peak IVC was inhibited by univalent salts and preferred phosvitin to casein, utilizing either ATP or GTP as a phosphate donor. 3. Tolbutamide increased the Km value for ATP and the dissociation constant for cyclic AMP, resulting in the inhibition of cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase activity in the presence of cyclic AMP. Tolbtamide and its carboxy derivative, 1-butyl-3-p-carboxyphenylsulfonylurea, exerted almost no inhibitory effect on either the cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase activities in the absence of cyclic AMP or on the cyclic-AMP independent protein kinase activities.\n",
      "A study of the single polypeptide nature of rhodanese. A comparison of different preparations. The enzyme rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) appears as a single polypeptide chain protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of this species is approx. 33 000. This contrasts with previous reports that rhodanese behaves on gel filtration chromatography as a rapidly equilibrating monomer-dimer system composed of identical subunits with a molecular weight of 18 500. We have investigated this apparent discrepancy by isolating the enzyme by the two different preparative procedures used in the above investigations. The two crystalline samples were subjected to gel filtration chromatography under a wide variety of conditions and to sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. The two preparations yielded rhodanese which behaved identically and no evidence for the monomeric species was obtained under any experimental condition tested. Thin-layer gel chromatography of clarified liver homogenates gave no evidence of rhodanese species other than that present in the purified samples. The variation in molecular weights observed in gel filtration chromatography may be a reflection of the conformational mobility of the enzyme leading to solvent-dependent changes in Stokes radius. If rhodanese is dimeric, special interactions must stabilize it under the conditions tested here.\n",
      "Characterization of intracellular esterase A from Bacillus subtilis. Esterase A (EC 3.1.1.1) obtained by sonic disruption of Bacillus subtilis SR22 (spoA12, trpC2) was purified approximately 400-fold by differential chemical and heating precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and Bio-Rad P-150 gel filtration chromatography, with an overall yield of 59%. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed both aliphatic and aromatic acetate esters at substrate concentrations of 0.25 M but did not hydrolyze amino acid esters. Aliphatic alcohols did not inhibit the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate; the most potent inhibitors of esterase activity were mercuric chloride, diisopropylfluorophosphate, eserine, and sodium fluoride.\n",
      "[Cow's milk alkaline phospharase. II. Subunit structure, metalloproteic nature and kinetic parameters (author's transl)]. Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from cow's milk as a dimer comprising two identical or very similar subunits of about 85 000 molecular weight. The enzyme contains 4.9 +/- 0.6 gatoms of zinc per mol of protein. The essential kinetic properties are the same as those of other alkaline phosphatases: variation of pH optimum value, the lack of specificity, increase of Km and V with pH value. The phosphotransferase activity is enlarged, at constant concentration of acceptor, with an increasing concentration of donor. The small size of molecules and the presence of hydroxyls and amino groups increase the percentage of transfer phosphate. The phosphotransferase reaction is better with the D-isomer of serine and the enzyme possesses a more important affinity for the D-phosphoserine.\n",
      "Kinetic properties of pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme. Hydrolysis of hippurylglycylglycine. Some of the kinetic properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.15.1) purified from hog lung have been determined using hippurylglycylglycine as substrate. The effects of pH and ionic environment on enzyme activity are complex and interdependent. At 0.1 M NaCl, the pH-activity curve shows an abrupt decrease in V/Km as the pH rises from 6 to 6.5, implying that ionization of a group in the enzyme with a pK in this range aids in binding of the substrate. Chloride is required for enzyme activity; there are two phases in the effect of NaCl. At both pH 6 AND 8, THE FIRST PHASE (UP TO 0.1 M NaCl) is activation. The second phase (above 0.1 M) at pH 6 is inhibition, while at pH 8 there is further activation which appears to be dependent upon ionic strength rather than a specific Cl-effect. Activation by cobalt and inhibition by EDTA are somewhat more effective at pH 6 than at pH 8. The nonapeptide inhibitor less than Glu-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro is nearly equipotent at both pH 6 and 8, but Arg-Pro-Pro is more inhibitory at pH 8 than at pH 6.\n",
      "Separation and properties of the NAD-linked and NADP-linked isozymes of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase in Euglena gracilis z. Euglena gracilis z contained two succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.16), one requiring NAD and the other NADP, and these isozymes were separated from each other and partially purified. The NAD-linked isozyme was relatively stable on storage at 5 degrees C whereas the NADP-linked one was extremely unstable unless 30% glycerol or ethyleneglycol was added. The optimum pH was 8.7 and optimum temperature 35-45 degrees C for both isozymes. They were inhibited by Zn2+ and activated, particularly the NAD-linked enzyme, by K+. Sulfhydryl reagents activated both isozymes. The Km values for succinic semialdehyde were 1.66 - 10(-4) M with the NAD-linked isozyme and 1.06 - 10(-3) M with the NADP-linked one. The NADP-linked isozyme was induced by glutamate while the NAD-linked one was not. Probable roles of these isozymes in the physiology of Euglena gracilis are discussed.\n",

The activity of a partially purified preparation of tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2) from the bovine caudate nucleus was increased by heparin, chondroitin sulfate, phosphatidylserine, polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl sulfuric acid and both poly-D-, and poly-L-glutamic acids, all polyanions. A variety of salts both activated the enzyme and prevented the activation by the polyanions. The observations that activity is increased when the enzyme interacts with salts and with macromolecules of high negative charge density are used to infer a model for these interactions and for the structural change in the enzyme that accompanies activation.\n",

(1) The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters of the reaction catalyzed by pigeon liver diacetyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.5) was investigated in the pH range 5.1-8.6. (2) From the results obtained it is postulated that: (a), a group of pK around 7, active in the protonated form, participates in the interaction of the enzyme with NADH and NAD. (b), a second group with a pK of 8.4, active in the protonated form too, takes part in the binding of diacetyl to E-NADH. (c) A third group of pK about 4.7-5, active in the unprotonated form, is involved at least in the dissociation of the complex E-NAD and in the attachment of diacetyl to E-NADH.\n",

Pig heart NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase is inactivated by reaction with iodoacetate at pH 6.0. Loss of activity can be attributed to the formation of 1-2 mol of carboxymethyl-cysteine per peptide chain. The rate of inactivation is markedly decreased by the combined addition of Mn2+ and isocitrate, but not by alpha-ketoglutarate, the coenzyme NAD or the allosteric activator ADP. The substrate concentration dependence of the decreased rate of inactivation yields a dissociation constant of 1.6 mM for the enzyme-manganous-dibasic isocitrate complex, a value that is 50 times higher than the Km for this substrate. This result suggests that in protecting the enzyme against iodoacetate, isocitrate may bind to a region distinct from the catalytic site. Isocitrate and Mn2+ also prevent thermal denaturation, with an affinity for the enzyme close to that observed for the iodoacetate-sensitive site. The alkylatable cysteine residues may contribute to a manganous-isocitrate binding site which is responsible for stabilizing an active conformation of the enzyme.\n",
      "Purification and properties of NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase from yeast nuclear fractions. 1. NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.4) extracted from nuclear fractions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was partially purified. The final purification achieved was over 100-fold over the initial extract. 2. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis shows that the preparation is close to homogeneity and that the enzyme is slightly more anionic than cytoplasmic glutamate dehydrogenase. 3. The response of the nuclear activity to variation of pH, of inorganic phosphate and other electrolyte concentration and of the concentration of the reaction substrates has been investigated. Several differences were detected in comparison with cytoplasmic glutamate dehydrogenase.\n",
      "Comparative kinetic studies on the L-type pyruvate kinase from rat liver and the enzyme phosphorylated by cyclic 3', 5'-AMP-stimulated protein kinase. The kinetics of rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), phosphorylated with cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase from the same source, and the unphosphorylated enzyme have been compared. The effects of pH and various concentrations of substrates, Mg2+, K+ and modifiers were studied. In the absence of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate at pH 7.3, the phosphorylated pyruvate kinase appeared to have a lower affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate (K0.5=0.8 mM) than the unphosphorylated enzyme (K0.5=0.3 mM). The enzyme activity vs. phosphoenolpyruvate concentration curve was more sigmoidal for the phosphorylated enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 2.6 compared to 1.6 for the unphosphorylated enzyme. Fructose 1, 6-diphosphate increased the apparent affinity of both enzyme forms for phosphoenolpyruvate. At saturating concentrations of this activator, the kinetics of both enzyme forms were transformed to approximately the same hyperbolic curve, with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 and K0.5 of about 0.04 mM for phosphoenolpyruvate. The apparent affinity of the enzyme for fructose 1, 6-diphosphate was high at 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate with a K0.5=0.06 muM for the unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase and 0.13 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme. However, in the presence of 0.5 mM alanine plus 1.5 mM ATP, a higher fructose 1, 6-diphosphate concentration was needed for activation, with K0.5 of 0.4 muM for the unphosphorylated enzyme and of 1.4 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme. The results obtained strongly indicate that phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase may also inhibit the enzyme in vivo. Such an inhibition should be important during gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "Denaturation-induced disulfide formation in the enzyme rhodanese. The effect of denaturants on the quantitation of free sulfhydryl groups in the enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) has been reinvestigated in some detail. The sulfhydryl assay with the colorimetric reagent 5, 5'-dithio-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) Nbs2 shows four sulfhydryl groups per enzyme molecule (mol. wt. 32 300) when the colorimetric reagent is added to the assay mixture before the denaturant, sodium dodecyl sulfate. On the other hand, only two sulfhydryl groups per molecule are observed when Nbs2 is added after denaturation has been initiated. The time dependence observed in this latter procedure indicates that the loss of the two groups is rapid and permanent. The results depend on the denaturant used: urea acts like sodium dodecyl sulfate while guanidine reveals four sulfhydryl groups independent of reagent order. The assay also gives four sulfhydryl groups independent of reagent order. The assay also gives four sulfhydryl groups independent of reagent order with urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate under conditions which are expected to limit metal ion-catalyzed oxidation of sulfhydryl groups (e.g. oxygen exclusion or metal ion chelation). Recent studies have shown that rhodanese has a molecular weight of 32 600, no disulfides and four sulfhydryl groups per molecule. These results together with the observations reported here are taken to indicate that a disulfide can be formed during denaturation of rhodanese and that the pathway of denaturation determines the result obtained.\n",
      "Studies on a 3beta-hydroxysteroid sulphotransferase from rat liver. A steroid sulphotransferase (EC 2.8.2.2) was partially purified from female rat liver. The enzyme was active towards the substrates, dehydroepiandrosterone, epiandrosterone and pregnenolone but was inactive towards oestrogens, cholesterol and ergocalciferol. A pH optimum of 5.0 was recorded but the enzyme was unstable at low pH. The enzyme was stimulated slightly by the addition of reducing agents and inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and HgCl2. Crude enzyme activity was markedly stimulated by divalent cations but this effect was not observed with purified enzyme. A Km of 13 muM was calculated for the donor substrate 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulphate and the acceptor substrate, dehydroepiandrosterone had a Km value of 6 muM. The enzyme appeared to be highly susceptible to product inhibition by adenosine 3', 5'-diphosphate.\n",
      "An ESR study of the influence of some physico-chemical factors on the conformation of a postsynaptic acetylcholinesterase. 1. In a previous ESR study of a membrane acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) we found, contrary to observations by other authors, spectra indicating that the active serine might be located in a pocket of the enzyme surface. In order to inquire into this possibility, ESR spectra were studied under the influence of different physico-chemical factors known to cause an unfolding of proteins. 2. The active serine of the postsynaptic membrane acetylcholinesterase of Torpedo marmorata electric organ was spin labeled using 1-oxyl-2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyletoxyphosphonofluoridate. 3. The effect of the chosen physico-chemical factors was an increase in the rotational freedom of spin labels; this result corroborates the suggestion that the active center of our acetylcholinesterase preparation is located in a pocket.\n",
      "Presence and androgen control of an alkaline phosphatase in the nucleus of rat ventral prostate. The presence of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) activity has been demonstrated in nuclei of rat ventral prostate. This enzyme activity remained after washing of isolated nuclei with 0.5% Triton X-100; an acid phosphatase initially present with the nuclear fraction was removed by this treatment. The nuclear alkaline phosphatase, examined by utilizing p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, had a pH optimum of 9.5-10.3, and a broad substrate specificity: p-nitrophenyl phosphate greater than phosphothreonine greater than beta-glycerophosphate greater than phosphoserine. The nuclear phosphatase was sensitive to denaturation by heat or urea treatments and was also inhibited by Pi, L-phenylalanine, homoarginine, dithiothreitol, and EDTA. The EDTA-inhibited enzyme was maximally reactivated by Zn2+, although Mg2+, or Ca2+ were also effective at somewhat higher concentrations. Orchiectomy of adult rats resulted in an increase in the nuclear alkaline phosphatase activity (2-3-fold at 24 or 48 h postorchiectomy). A decline in the protein: DNA ratio also occurred following orchiectomy, but the increase in phosphatase specific activity was evident whether expressed per unit of protein or per unit of DNA. Testosterone replacement following orchiectomy abolished the increase in nuclear phosphatase activity. The results suggest that the prostatic nuclear alkaline phosphatase may be involved in events related to inactivation of the prostate nucleus following androgen deprivation.\n",
      "Removal of phosphate groups from casein with potato acid phosphatase. Potato acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) was used to remove the eight phosphate groups from alphas1-casein. Unlike most acid phosphatases, which are active at pH 6.0 or below, potato acid phosphatase can catalyze the dephosphorylation of alphas1-casein at pH 7.0. Although phosphate inhibition is considerable (K1=0.42 mM phosphate), the phosphate ions produced by the dephosphorylation of casein can be removed by dialysis, allowing the reaction to go to completion. The dephosphorylated alphas1-casein is homogeneous on gel electrophoresis with a slower mobility than native alphas1-casein and has an amino acid composition which is identical to native alphas1-casein. Thus the removal of phosphate groups from casein does not alter its primary structure. Potato acid phosphatase also removed the phosphate groups from other phosphoproteins, such as beta-casein, riboflavin binding protein, pepsinogen, ovalbumin, and phosvitin.\n",
      "Multiple forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in pig epidermis. Pig epidermal cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (EC 3.1.4.16) have been partially purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. At least three different forms of the epidermal phosphodiesterases were identified. They were cyclic GMP-specific, cyclic GMP- and cyclic AMP-hydrolyzing and apparently a cyclic AMP-specific enzyme: the first two forms were soluble and the last was the particulate enzyme. The cyclic GMP-specific soluble fraction had a relatively low Km, the cyclic GMP- and cyclic AMP-hydrolyzing fraction had a high Km for the respective substrates and the third particulate enzyme had both high and low Km values for cyclic AMP. The cyclic GMP-hydrolyzing enzyme was localized almost entirely in the soluble fraction, whereas cyclic AMP-hydrolyzing enzyme was distributed to both soluble and particulate fractions. Thus, our studies show that the multiple forms of pig epidermal enzyme differ distinctly in their substrate affinity, specificity and subcellular distribution.\n",
      "Ascorbic acid-2-sulfate sulfhohydrolase activity of human arylsulfatase A. Pure human arylsulfatase A (EC 3.1.6.1) was found to hydrolyze ascorbic acid 2-sulfate to ascorbic acid and inorganic sulfate at rates from 200 to 2000 mumol/mg per h depending on the method of assay. This rate was lower than that observed with the synthetic substrate 4-nitrocatechol sulfate, but higher than that seen with the physiological substrate cerebroside sulfate. Extracts of cultured fibroblasts from normal subjects were also shown to hydrolyze ascorbic acid 2-sulfate; extracts of fibroblasts from patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, known to be deficient in arylsulfatase A, did not. Similarly, hydrolysis of ascorbic acid 2-sulfate was not observed when a partially purified preparation of human arylsulfatase B was tested under a variety of conditions. Thus, in the human, arylsulfatase A appears to be the major, if not the only, ascorbic acid-2-sulfate sulfohydrolase.\n",
      "Human alpha-fucosidase. Single residual enzymatic form in fucosidosis. Four major forms of alpha-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) activity were separated by isoelectrofocusing from sera of normal control individuals. All forms shifted towards less acidic pI values after neuraminidase treatment. In two patients affected with fucosidosis, only a single major acidic peak was observed and this was affected to a lesser degree by neuraminidase treatment. The kinetics of heat inactivation of the residual activity found in these two patients showed two decay rates while the controls showed only one rate. These data are considered in relation to the hypothesis of the existence of interconvertible thermolabile and thermostable forms of the enzyme which has been discussed in the preceeding paper. The residual alpha-fucosidase found in patients could be structurally altered so that its ability to form the thermostable higher molecular weight aggregates is impaired.\n",
      "Separation of two PZ-peptidases from bovine dental follicle. Two PZ-peptidases (EC 3.4.-) (A and B) cleaving a synthetic substrate for collagenase, 4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-L-Pro-L-Leu-Gly-L-Pro-D-Arg (PZ-peptide) have been separated from the particulate fraction of bovine dental follicle. PZ-peptidase A had a molecular weight of 220 000, an optimum pH at 8.0-8.5, and a Km value of 67 muM toward PZ-peptide at pH 7.1, whereas PZ-peptidase B had a molecular weight of 20 000, an optimum pH at 6.5-6.7, and a Km value of 400 muM toward PZ-peptide at pH 7.1. Two similar enzymes were also isolated from the soluble fraction. Since the pH-activity curve of the crude tissue preparations such as homogenate, microsomes and soluble supernatant had two peaks at 6.5-6.7 and 8.0-8.5, both PZ-peptidase A and B may exist in situ as two independent active enzymes.\n",
      "Properties of the major carboxypeptidase in the larvae of the webbing clothes moth, Tineola bisselliella. The larvae of the webbing clothes moth, Tineola bisselliella contain two carboxypeptidases (EC 3.4.12-) and one of these has been purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its pH optimum for the hydrolysis of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-glycyl-leucine was pH 7.5-7.7 and its molecular weight as judged by gel filtration was 72 000. It is strongly inhibited by disopropylfluorophosphate, thiol reagents and some metal cations and also by 1:10 phenanthroline but not EDTA. Km and V values for the hydrolysis of 13 N-acyl dipeptides were determined. The enzyme has a strong preference for neutral aliphatic amino acid residues and does not hydrolyse C-terminal proline, arginine or lysine. It is a true carboxypeptidase, requiring an L-amino acid in the C-terminal position, with a free carboxyl group and hydrolysing peptide substrates consecutively from the C-terminal end. Dipeptides are cleaved much more slosly than tripeptides or N-acyl dipeptides.\n",
      "Cathepsins B1 from human fetal membranes. Cathepsins B1 (EC 3.4.22.1) were isolated from fetal membranes of human placenta, i.e. amnion and chorion-decidua. Purification of the enzymes was achieved by the freezing-thawing technique, ammonium sulphate fractionation and Sephadex gel filtration. Cathepsis B1 separated either from amnion or from chorion-decidua exhibited optimum activity at pH 6.2, and an optimum temperature between 42-45 degrees C. They were inhibited by heavy metals, and compounds which react with the thiol groups. Isoelectric focusing demonstrated three isoenzymes of cathepsin B1 originating from chorion-decidua, while only one band was found for the enzyme from amnion.\n",
      "Purification of multiple forms of adenosine deaminase from rabbit intestine. Two forms of adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.4), differing in molecular size, have been purified and obtained in homogeneous form from rabbit intestine. The purification procedures involved extraction with acetate buffer, pH 5.5, precipitation and fractional reextraction with (NH4)2SO4, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and Sephadex G-200. Gel filtrations analysis gave molecular weight estimates of 265 000 and 32 000 for the large and small deaminases respectively. The two enzymes forms had similar pH optima and pH stability ranges.\n",
      "Stimulation of photosystem I-induced oxidation of chloroplast cytochrome b-559 by pre-illumination and by low pH. (1) The proportion of higher plant chloroplast cytochrome b-559 oxidizable during illumination by low intensity 732 nm light increases as the pH is decreased below 6.5. At pH 5.0-5.3 total oxidation is seen and subsequent red light can cause reduction of up to 2/3 of the oxidized cytochrome. The oxidation by far red light at pH 5 is inhibited by 2 muM 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-rho-benzoquinone whereas the red light-induced reduction is inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. In this pH range ferricyanide-oxidized cytochrome b-559 exists in a form not reducible by ferrocyanide. (2) An increase in the amplitude of far-red induced oxidation also occurs at higher pH (up to pH 7.8) after pre-treatment of chloroplasts with substantially higher levels of light (approx. 10(6) ergs-cm-2-s-1). The degree of light activation is pH dependent, being more pronounced at lower pH. After light activation, cytochrome b-559 can be completely oxidized by far-red light in a manner reversible by red light up to pH values of 6, and the curve describing the amplitude of far-red oxidation as a function of pH is shifted by 0.5-1.0 pH unit toward higher pH. Far-red oxidation and red light reduction are again inhibited by 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, respectively. (3) Light activation at pH 5.2-6.0 is also manifested in a small decrease in the amplitude of subsequent dark ferrocyanide reduction, and this decrease is inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (10 muM). (4) The effect of intramembranal acidity on the effective redox potential of cytochrome b-559 and its function is discussed.\n",
      "The effect of formate on cytochrome aa3 and on electron transport in the intact respiratory chain. 1. Formate inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity both in intact mitochondria and submitochondrial particles, and in isolated cytochrome aa3. The inhibition increases with decreasing pH, indicating that HCOOH may be the inhibitory species. 2. Formate induces a blue shift in the absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochrome aa3 (a3 + a33+) and in the half-reduced species (a2 + a33+). Comparison with cyanide-induced spectral shifts, towards the red, indicates that formate and cyanide have opposite effects on the aa3 spectrum, both in the fully oxidized and the half-reduced states. The formate spectra provide a new method of obtaining the difference spectrum of a32+ minus a33+, free of the difficulties with cyanide (which induces marked high leads to low spin spectral shifts in cytochrome a33+) and azide (which induces peak shifts of cytochrome a2+ towards the blue in both alpha- and Soret regions). 3. The rate of formate dissociation from cytochrome a2+ a33+ -HCOOH is faster than its rate of dissociation from a3+ a33+ -HCOOH, especially in the presence of cytochrome c. The Ki for formate inhibition of respiration is a function of the reduction state of the system, varying from 30 mM (100% reduction) to 1 mM (100% oxidation) at pH 7.4, 30 degrees C. 4. Succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity is also inhibited by formate, in a reaction competitive with succinate and dependent on [formate]2. 5. Formate inhibition of ascorbate plus N, N, N', N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine oxidation by intact rat liver mitochondria is partially released by uncoupler addition. Formate is permeable through the inner mitochondrial membrane and no differences in 'on' or 'off' inhibition rates were observed when intact mitochondria were compared with submitochondrial particles. 6. NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity is unaffected by formate in submitochondrial particles, but mitochondrial oxidation of glutamate plus malate is subject both to terminal inhibition at the cytochrome aa3 level and to a slow extra inhibition by formate following uncoupler addition, indicating a third site of formate action in the intact mitochondrion.\n",
      "The coupling factor of photophosphorylation and the electric properties of the thylakoid membrane. The rate of ATP synthesis of illuminated chloroplasts is correlated with the electric conductance of their inner membranes. In agreement with previous studies it is shown that ATP synthesis is paralleled by an increased conductance of the thylakoid membrane. This conductance together with the ability to form ATP is abolished if chloroplasts are treated with an antibody against the coupling factor CF1. It is not influenced by the fragmented monovalent antibody. This parallels the lack of influence of the fragmented antibody on ATP synthesis in contrast to its influence on hydrolysis and exchange reactions. We conclude that there are different sites for the interaction of the coupling factor with adenine nucleotides. Extraction of the coupling factor is shown to increase the membrane conductance by more than two orders of magnitude. Reincorporation of the crude coupling factor partially restores the net conductance of the membrane (increase in resistance by a factor of 2.5), while a higher degree of restoration was observed for ATP synthesis and the proton conductivity of the membrane. We conclude that the extraction procedure opens different conductive channels in the membrane; a proton specific one, possibly associated with the binding protein for the coupling factor, plus other channels for \"non-protons\" which in contrast to the proton channel cannot be plugged by reincorporation of the coupling factor.\n",
      "Evidence against proton gradient formation being the cause of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching by N-methylphenazonium methosulfate. In strong illumination, 3-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU)-poisoned chloroplasts exhibit a high yield of chlorophyll fluorescence while P-700 turnover, proton uptake, and phosphorylation are inhibited and a pH gradient is undectectable. When 10muM N-methylphenazonium methosulfate (PMS) is included, the fluorescence yield in light is substantially reduced, and when 100 muM ascorbate is also included, the yield is diminished approximately to the level in darkness. Only very slight increases in P-700 turnover and proton uptake (but no detectable pH gradient) accompany the fluorescence yield decline. When 10muM PMS and 15 mM ascorbate are added to poisoned chloroplasts (the oxygen concentration being greatly reduced), P-700 turnover, proton uptake, the pH gradient and phosphorylation all reach high levels. In this case, the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence is low and is the same in both light and dark. Further addition of an uncoupler eliminates proton uptake, the pH gradient and phosphorylation but does not significantly elevate the fluorescence yield. From these observations we suggest that, in DCMU-poisoned chloroplasts, the fluorescence quenching with PMS occurrs by a mechanism unrelated to the generation of a phosphyorylation potential. With chloroplasts unpoisoned by DCMU, PMS quenches fluorescence and considerably stimulates proton uptake, the pH gradient and phosphorylation. However, in this case, PMS serves to restore net electron transport.\n",
      "The accumulation of superoxide radical during the aerobic action of xanthine oxidase. A requiem for H2O4. The action of xanthine oxidase upon acetaldehyde or xanthine at pH 10.2 has been shown to be accompanied by substantial accumulation of O2- during the first few minutes of the reaction. H2O2 decreases this accumulation of O2- presumably because of the Haber-Weiss reaction (H2O2+O2- leads to OH- +OH+O2) and very small amounts of superoxide dismutase eliminate it. This accumulation of O2- was demonstrated in terms of a burst of reduction of cytochrome c, seen when the latter compound was added after aerobic preincubation of xanthine oxidase with its substrate. The kinetic peculiarities of the luminescence seen in the presence of luminol, which previously led to the proposal of H2O4-, can now be satisfactorily explained entirely on the basis of known radical intermediates.\n",
      "The 520 nm absorbance changes in Scenedesmus obliquus and its relation to photosystem I. The kinetics (region of seconds) of the light-induced 520 nm absorbance changes and its dark reversal have been studied in detail in the wild type and in some pigment and photosynthetic mutants of Scenedesmus obliquus. The following 5 lines of evidence led us to conclude that the signal is entirely due to the photosystem I reaction modified by electron flow from Photosystem II. Gradual blocking of the electron transport with 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea resulted in diminution and ultimate elimination of the biphasic nature of the signal without reducing the extent of the absorbance change or of the dark kinetics. On the contrary, blocking electron flow at the oxidizing side of plastoquinone with 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isoprophyl-p-benzoquinone or inactivating the plastocyanin with KCN, prolonged the dark reversal of the absorbance change apart from abolishing the biphasic nature of the signal. Action spectra clearly indicate that the main signal (I) is due to electron flow in Photosystem I and that its modification (Signal II) is due to the action of Photosystem II. Signal I is pH independent, whereas Signal II demonstrates a strong pH dependence, parallel to the O2-evolving capacity of the cells. Chloroplast particles isolated from the wild type Scenedesmus cells demonstrated in the absence of any added artificial electron donor or acceptor and also under non-phosphorylation conditions the 520 nm absorbance change with approximately the same magnitude as whole cells. The dark kinetics of the particles were comparatively slower. Removal of plastocyanin and other electron carriers by washing with Triton X-100 slowed down the kinetics of the dark reversal reaction to a greater extent. A similar positive absorbance change at 520 nm and slow dark reversal  was also observed in the Photosystem I particles prepared by the Triton method. Mutant C-6E, which contains neither carotenoids nor chlorophyll b and lacks Photosystem II activity, demonstrates a normal signal I of the 520 nm absorbance change. This latter result contradicts the postulate that carotenoids are the possible cause of the 520 nm absorbance change.\n",
      "Pyruvate flux into resealed ghosts from human erythrocytes. The kinetics of pyruvate transport across the isolated red blood cell membrane were studied by a simple and precise spectrophotometric method: following the oxidation of NADH via lactate dehydrogenase trapped within resealed ghosts. The initial rate of pyruvate entry was linear. Influx was limited by saturation at high pyruvate concentration. Pyruvate influx was greatly stimulated by increasing ionic strength in the outer but not the inner aqueous compartment. The Km ranged from 15.0 mM at mu = 0.05 to 3.7 mM at mu = 0.01, while the V went from 0.611 - 10(15) to 0.137 - 10(-15) mol - min-1 - ghost-1. Ionic strength was shown to affect the translocation step and not pyruvate binding. The energy of activation of pyruvate flux into resealed ghosts was 25 kcal/mol, similar to that found in intact red blood cells. Inhibitors of pyruvate influx included such anions as thiocyanate, chloride, bicarbonate, alpha-cyanocinnamate, salicylate and ketomalonate (but not acetate); noncompetitive inhibitors were phloretin, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanate-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and o-phenanthroline/CuSO4 mixtures. The last reagent, known to induce disulfide links in certain membrane proteins, blocked the ionic strength stimulation of pyruvate influx in this study.\n",
      "Heme models. I. Solution behavior of a water soluble iron porphyrin. A well-behaved water soluble iron-porphyrin system, meso-tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl) porphinato iron (III) was synthesized. Its solution behavior is described using visable and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The complex exists in solution as three distinct forms of bridged dimers, oxo, hydroxo and aquo, with the following pK's: oxo + H+ in equilibrium hydroxo, pK = 9.58; hydroxo + H+ in equilibrium aquo, pK = 6.72. In the presence of excess imidazole the second pK is found to be 7.05. Detailed analysis of the interaction of the hydroxo-bridged form with imidazole is presented. It is found that one dimer unit simultaneously binds two imidazole molecules, with an over-all equilibrium constant log Keq = -1.22. EPR spectra are presented for the various forms of iron-porphyrin discussed.\n",
      "17 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of the sheep ovary : purification, properties and substrate binding site. Sheep ovarian 17 beta HSDH has been purified about 1000 fold to a specific activity of 0.5 IU/mg protein, using DEAE cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on estrone-amino caproate-Sepharose and a second DEAE cellulose chromatography. The molecular weight is 70,000 ; the pH optimum for activity is 9.2 and the energy of activation is 16.5 Kcal/mole. The kinetics of the oxidation of estradiol and many analogues have been studied at various concentrations and in the presence of different amounts of coenzyme. The data are in agreement with a compulsory order mechanism with the binding of NAD+ as the first substrate. Sheep ovarian 17 beta HSDH accepts subtituents in position C3, C11, C13 ; the substrate binding site is open in this region. On the contrary, the binding requirements are strict for the region of C10 since the presence of a C19 methyl group impairs binding and (or) oxidation of the steroid. Sheep ovarian and human placental 17 beta HSDH have close analogies : molecular weight, pH optimum, substrate binding site requirements. Their reaction mechanisms are different : random for the placental 17 beta HSDH, compulsory order for the ovarian 17 beta HSDH : this can be explained by the effect of the coenzyme upon the binding of the substrate : without effect on placental enzyme, the coenzyme fixation enhances the affinity of the ovarian 17 beta HSDH for any substrate.\n",
      "Complete purification and studies on the structural and kinetic properties of two forms of yeast valyl-tRNA synthetase. Two forms of baker's yease valyl-tRNA synthetase have been purified to apparent homogeneity by classical methods. It was demonstrated that one of the two forms of the enzyme originates from the other by proteolysis, the respective amounts of each form depending on the physiological state of the yeast. The species mainly isolated from exponential growing yeast cells is a monomer of 130,000 daltons molecular weight. In stationary phase cells or in commercial yeast the major species is a degraded monomer of 120,000 daltons molecular weight ; however when the purification is carried out in the presence of phenylmethyl-sulphonyl fluoride, or diisopropylfluorophosphate large amounts of the not - degreded monomer can be obtained. Of great practical usefulness is the fact that large amounts of the native enzyme can be obtained pure after only two chromatographic steps on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The kinetic constants for valine, ATP and tRNAVal were determined, as well as the optimum aminoacylation conditions. It was found that the specific activity of the nondegraded valyl-tRNA synthetase is higher than that of the proteolysed enzyme for the aminoacylation reaction. On the contrary, both forms have the same ATP-pyroposphate exchange activity. The amino acids composition of the native enzyme was established. The tryptic fingerprints of the two valyl-tRNA synthetases were studied. Essentially similar maps were obtained. The number of the spots in the fingerprints indicates that the enzymes contain a high proportion of repeated sequences.\n",
      "[Rat liver plasma membrane phospholipase A]. The plasma membranes phospholipase A2 studied in situ shows very little sensitivity for pH variations ; the optimal concentration for Ca++ is 5 mM ; the enzymatic kinetics are of the Michaelis type. An inactive state of the phospholipase A2 exists : when rats are injected with heparin, their plasma membranes contain a very low phospholipase A2 activity. These membranes recover a high A2 activity if they are incubated in the presence of a rat platelets lysate. Treatment of membranes by NaCl 1 M displaces phospholipase A1 and phospholipase A2 but for the latter only when being in active state. Treatment of animals, conditions of preparation and of incubation of membranes influence the respective amounts of phospholipases A1 and A2 present in these membranes and are discussed in this paper. The localisation of these enzymatic proteins inside the membrane according to the membranous model proposed by Singer et al. [18] is also discussed.\n",
      "Phosphate uptake in Chlorella pyrenoidosa : II. Effect of pH and of SH reagents. The sensitivity of the phosphate transport system to pCMPS after phosphate starvation is dependent on protein synthesis. This fact is related to the development of transport activity at alkaline pH. In non-starved cells, the presence of only one peak of maximal activity for phosphate uptake at neutral pH (at low and high concentration) has been observed. However, in phosphate starved cells, two peaks of maximal activity (at low phosphate concentration) at neutral and alkaline pH are present. In starved cells, pCMPS inhibits more intensely the phosphate transport activity at alkaline pH than at neutral pH. By contrast, NEM inhibits the phosphate transport more strongly at neutral than at alkaline pH. Phosphate uptake at neutral and alkaline pH are sensitive to osmotic shock, but phosphate uptake at alkaline pH is decreased more than at neutral pH. The results could be interpreted either by assuming that the membrane surroundings change during phosphate starvation or that two transport systems are present in starved cells whereas only one transport system exists in non-starved cells.\n",
      "Possible occurrence for histidyl and cysteyl residues in the catalytic center of rat liver mitochondrial D (-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. 1. Rat liver mitochondrial D(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (submitochondrial particles and partially purified preparation) is inhibited by some dicarboxylates, especially by malonate and succinate. The inhibition is reversible and competitive with beta-hydroxybutyrate while uncompetitive with acetoacetate, NAD and NADH: the inhibition is maximal at pH 6 and decrease with increasing pH. 2. Diethylpyrocarbonate (which reacts preferentially with histidyl residues at pH 6.6) inactivates the dehydrogenase at pH 6.1, beta-hydroxybutyrate protects against inactivation, this inactivation being almost completely released by hydroxylamine. The diethylpyrocarbonate-treated enzyme shows an absorbance increase at 242 nm which is characterisitic of reaction between diethylpyrocarbonate and histidyl residue. 3. The optimum pH of the enzyme for beta-hydroxybutyrate oxidation is around 8.2, while for acetoacetate reduction, the optimum pH is around 7. 4. All these results favour the existence of a histidyl residue in the catalytic center and taking into account previous results concerning the effect of thiol reagents on the same enzyme and especially, the protective effect of NAD+ and NADH against these reagents [11] we discuss the possible occurrence of, at least, one histidyl and one cysteyl residue on the catalytic center.\n",
      "[Mechanism of glutaraldehyde-protein bond formation]. Commercial aqueous 25% glutaraldehyde solutions contain no stable derivative of this aldehyde, but compounds of variable molecular weight which easily revert to glutaraldehyde. The effect of pH on the reaction of glutarldehyde with amino acids and on the stability of the products under acid conditions, shows the importance of the structure modification of the dialdehyde which occurs when pH increases, and even leads to precipitation in highly alkaline solutions. This precipitate results from aldol condensation of glutaraldehyde molecules. It contains aldehyd groups conjugated with ethylenic double bonds. Such a structure reacts with amino groups to give an imino bond, stabilized by resonance with the ethylenic bond, and does not undergo Michael-type addition reactions. Therefore, glutaraldehyde does not react with proteins under its free form, but as an unsaturated polymer, which gives imino bonds stabilized by conjugation.\n",

Various membraneous fractions prepared from a cauliflower homogenate synthesize radioactive oleic acid when they are incubated in a 14C-decanolate solution. The more active fraction is formed of vesicles sedimenting at 30,000 g x 20 mn (heavy microsomes). The labelled precursor is transformed by this fraction mainly into oleic acid and hydroxyacids. ATP, NADPH, CoA and oxygen are required for these reactions. Labelled fatty acids, longer than lauric and (i.e. 14C-myristic, 14C-palmitic and 14C-stearic acids) are not transformed into oleic acid by the subcellular fraction studied in this paper.\n",
      "[Acetylcholinesterase. II. Experimental aspects of interaction with reversible effectors under conditions of high ionic strength]. Interaction of usual effectors with acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) from bovine erythrocytes was examined under conditions of high ionic strength (gamma/2 greater than or equal to 0,1). Detailed kinetic investigation of the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase in the presence of modifiers shows that the effects produced by numerous quaternary nitrogen compounds on the enzyme can be explained on the basis of binding of the effectors to the anionic subsite of the active center. The various kinetic behaviors, that are observed, are dependent on the relative values of the deacetylation rate constant ak of the complex acetylated enzyme-modifier and of the rate constant k-2 defined by : (see article) with respect to the value of the deacetylation rate constant K of the acetylated enzyme. If a identical to [1--(k/k-2)]-1, it is shown that interaction of the enzyme with tetraethylammonium, pentamethonium, hexamethonium and gallamine ions is characterized by : a greater than a and k-2 greater than k therefore, these modifiers accelerate deacetylation. On the other hand, inhibition of acetylcholinestase by methylpyridinium, d-tubocurarine, tetra-n-propylammonium, tetra-n-butylammonium, decamethonium and succinylbischoline is consistent with one of the conditions : a less than a and k-2 greater than or equal to k or a greater than a and k-2 less than k and inhibition by tetramethylammonium, phenyltrimethylammonium, 3-hydroxyphenyl-triethylammonium, N-methylacridinium and bis (3-aminopyridinium)-1,10-decane ions agrees with one of the two previous conditions or with : (see article) consequently, the effect of these ligands on the deacetylation step is undetermined. However, the effects of choline chloride, thiazinamium methyl sulfate and thioridazine hydrochloride are not entirely consistent with this mechanism but support the existence of a functional peripheral anionic site which is distinct from the anionic subsite of the active center.\n",
      "[Interactions of phosphorylethanolamine analogs with phosphorylethanolamine-citidylyltransferase]. Kinetic studies of ethanolaminephosphate-cytidylyltransferase (E.C. 2.7.7.14) from rat liver have been carried out in presence of structural analogues of ethanolaminephosphate : these compounds acted as inhibitors of the enzyme: - 2-aminoethylphosphonate behaved as a substrate and a competitive inhibitor to phosphorylethanolamine: the Km value of 2-aminoethylphosphonate was nearly the same as its Ki value, at pH = 5,5 (30 X 10(-3) M and 24 x 10(-3) M, respectively). - 3-aminopropylphosphonate was also a competitive inhibitor. It appeared to be the best inhibitor at pH optimum (pH = 7,7). - 1-aminoethylphosphonate behaved as a noncompetitive inhibitor. However, cytidylyltransferase was relatively specific, inhibitions being always weak. Inhibitory power of phosphonates was stimulated by Mg++.\n",
      "[Purification and properties of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (4.1.1.28) of rat brain]. L-aromatic aminoacid decarboxylase has been purified more than thousand times from homogenates of rat brain, in several steps : centrifugation, DEAE-cellulose, CM cellulose, hydroxylapatite, DEAE sephadex. Its properties have been studied, most of them on an intermediate fraction of the purification, because of the instability of the purified enzyme in spite of the addition of different stabilizing agents : the enzyme decarboxylates 5-hydroxytryptophan (5 HTP) and DOPA in a ratio constant throughout the purification but does not decarboxylate tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine at a measurable rate. Optimum pH, Km, Vm, have been measured with 5 HTP and DOPA as substrates. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 115.000, an apparent isoelectric point of 6,4-6,5. It is inhibited by serotonin, dopamine, some cations : Cu++, Fe++, Ni++ by N-ethylmaleimide, sodium dodecylsulfate. Some pyridoxal-5 phosphate (PLP) remains strongly bound to the enzyme. For relatively weak concentrations of substrate, the enzyme is inhibited by an excess of PLP ; for weak concentrations of PLP, the enzyme in inhibited by an excess of substrate, particularly of DOPA. We also observe a spontaneous decarboxylation of the substrates that reaches a plateau and is enhanced by high concentrations of PLP, by serotonin, dopamine, Cu++ and reduced by mercaptoethanol and the presence of crude or boiled homogenates. Several possible explanations of the spontaneous decarboxylation and of the enzymic inhibitions by an excess of PLP and by the substrates are given.\n",
      "[Characterization of some hydrolase activities in digestive juice of Achatina balteata]. The digestive juice of Achatina balteata, a giant snail of the West African Coast catalyses the hydrolysis of several natural and synthetic compounds. Enzymatic activities on lactose, o- and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D (and alpha-L-) fucoside, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide and phenolphthalein-glucuronide have been shown to be present. The effect of pH and substrate concentration on these activities were studied. The galactosidase, glucosidase and fucosidase activities were studied with respect to temperature, heat inactivation, pH stability and incubation with trypsin. Kinetic experiments suggest the presence of several galactosidase activities. This hypothesis is confirmed by specific staining after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These activities showed a broad specificity towards galactosides and glucosides. The digestive juice showed no action on acetyl-L-tyrosine and benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl esters. However a small protease activity was observed on hemoglobine. No lipase activity was found. Sulfatase content was low compared to that of Helix pomatia.\n",

      "Adjuvant and immunostimulating activities of water-soluble substances extracted from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (var. hominis). Water-soluble substances have been extracted from two strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. hominis: the native hydrosoluble part (polysaccharide and peptidoglycan), a substance in which the polysaccharide moiety is less abundant than in the latter, the acetylated peptidoglycan and, finally a tetrasaccharide-heptapeptide. All four types of substances, when they were injected together with Freund's incomplete adjuvant, exerted an adjuvant effect on the production of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin in the guinea pig and on the production of anti-influenza virus antibodies in the rabbit. Injected intravenously in the mouse, they increased the number of antibody-producing cells in the spleen and enhanced the graft versus host reaction; no effect was seen on the phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system. By contrast with wax D, the water-soluble substances were devoid of arthritis-inducing activity in the rat. Altogether, these water-soluble substances seem to be endowed with at least some of the adjuvant activities of Freund's complete adjuvant and some of the immunostimulant activities of a live Mycobacterium like BCG.\n",

      "Intrahepatic lymphoid tissue graft: course of the Gvh reaction induced by Peyer's patches. To investigate the thymus-dependent immune competence of Peyer's patches, the course of splenomegaly and hepatic perivascular infiltration (PVI) was studied as criteria of graft-versus-host reaction (GvhR). Parental or F1 hybrid lymphoid tissues, were intrahepatically implanted and the ability of Peyer's patches to induce a GvhR was compared to that of spleen, lymph nodes and thymus. A slight but significant delayed increase of spleen index was observed at the 40th post operative day following Peyer's patches implantation whereas the thymus did not induce any modification of this parameter. On the other hand, the PVI was a very early and precise criterion in monitoring the Gvh reaction induced by Peyer's patches, and allowed to postulate that at least one T-cell function is present within the Peyer's patches.\n",

The methyl ester of trifluoroacetic acid was prepared by reaction with N,N'-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal and was successfully passed through a gas chromatograph. Trifluoroacetic acid was detected by the use of gas chromatography and low and high resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry in an acidic extract of an incubation medium containing microsomes, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, oxygen and halothane. However, trifluoroacetic acid could not be detected when nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or oxygen was omitted from the incubation system. From these results, it was proved that halothane is oxidatively metabolized to trifluoroacetic acid by hepatic microsomes.\n",

      "Studies on gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in human and rabbit erythrocytes. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase transfers the gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione to a variety of acceptor amino acids. Through the operation of the gamma-glutamyl-cyclotransferase cycle, this enzyme has been implicated in the transport of amino acids into cells, especially the cells of the proximal tubules of kidney. It has been reported to be present in rabbit erythrocytes. However, using white cell-free preparations, we have not been able to demonstrate the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in human or rabbit erythrocytes either by measuring the utilization of GSH or by following the formation of the product. 14C-L-methionine was used as acceptor amino acid, and the formation of gamma-glutamyl-14C-L-methionine was followed. Using similar conditions, we have been able to demonstrate the presence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in human and rabbit leukocytes and in human kidney. In contrast to a previous report, we were unable to find the accumulation of 5-oxoproline, an intermediate of the gamma-glutamyl-cyclotransferase pathway in human red cells incubated in Krebs-Ringer solution. Immunologic studies demonstrated that human red cell membranes contained no protein antigenically similar to kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Thus our studies indicated that in human and rabbit erythrocytes, the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-cyclotransferase pathway was not operative.\n",
      "The pH dependence of quantitative ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation: theoretical and practical implications-a new device for maintenance of platelet-rich plasma pH. Quantitative ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation of normal platelet-rich plasma (PRP) decreased with time after PRP preparation. An increase in p H of the PRP with time proved to be responsible for this finding. Diffusion of CO2from the plasma is the prime determinant of the change in pH. Since a complex combination of factors influences CO2 diffusion (surface area-to-volume relationship, capping, mixing, etc.) The change in pH is variable with time. Thus, quantitative ristocetin aggregation should be pH controlled. A simple device for maintaining PRP pH constant by control of the ambient pCO2 was designed and found effective in keeping both pH and quantitative ristocetin aggregation constant over a prolonged period of time. It can be adapted for use in platelet aggregation studies employing other reagents. The pH dependence of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation is consistent with other data supporting an elctrostatic interaction between the platelet, von Willebrand factor, and ristocetin. We favor a model wherein ristocetin neutralizes some of the platelet's negative change and permits the von Willebrand factor to bridge sites on separate platelets to induce agglutination.\n",

      "On the mechanism of action of clozapine on the adrenergic neurone. 1 The antipsychotic drug, clozapine, lowered noradrenaline and metaraminol (MA) concentrations in the rat heart. This action was blocked by the presence of a ganglionic blocking drug. 2 Other alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine) did not significantly lower heart amine concentrations. An inhibitor of neuronal amine uptake (desipramine) caused only a slight lowering. The combination of phentolamine and desipramine showed considerable activity, and this action was blocked by ganglionic blockade. 3 Clozapine had little or no action in blocking amine uptake, yet greatly potentiated amine release caused by the phentolamine-desipramine combination. 4 Other antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine) or other agents (propranolol, atropine) did not share this action of clozapine. 5 Ganglionic blockade markedly delayed amine release induced by reserpine administration. 6 It is suggested that clozapine may have an incomplete reserpine-like effect specifically on the adrenergic neurone, facilitating impulse-induced amine release.\n",

      "Histamine H2-receptors in the human peripheral circulation. Histamine (10 mug/min for 3 min) infused into the brachial artery caused an increase in forearm blood flow which was reduced by mepyramine (25 mg). This effect was most marked in the first minute of the infusion. Metiamide (25 mg) had no effect on the dilatation during the infusion but caused a quicker return of flow to the resting level. The response was abolished when both drugs were given in combination. It is concluded that the response is initiated mainly by stimulation of H1-receptors and maintained by H1- and H2-receptors; continued activity of H2-receptors may account for the slow return of flow to the pre-infusional level.\n",
      "A trial of fenfluramine in the treatment of the chronic alcoholic patient. In a double blind trial, 50 male chronic alcoholic patients were treated with either fenfluramine in a dose of 60 mg or 120 mg daily, or with identically prepared placebo tablets. Patients were interviewed on admission to the trial and then at four-weekly intervals for a period of one year and blood levels of delta-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gammaGT) and fenfluramine were determined. The efficacy of fenfluramine at the two dose levels was compared with placebo on the basis of the number of lapses indicated by the clinical history and also by alterations in the biochemical indices. Twenty-seven patients completed the period of observation, there being 9 in each of the three groups. Those receiving 120 mg fenfluramine daily showed significantly fewer lapses than either of the other two groups (p less than 0-01) on biochemical but not on clinical criteria. Overall assessment revealed that 3 of the 9 patients receiving the high dose of fenfluramine had a good result during the period of the trial, but there were none in the 60 mg group or in those receiving placebo. More extensive trials of fenfluramine in the treatment of chronic alcoholism are indicated.\n",
      "Towards rational therapy with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. A rational approach to the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is outlined. Patients suitable for treatment cannot be classified adequately using conventional diagnostic labels. They include those with primary symptoms of hypochondriasis, agoraphobia and social phobias, irritability, somatic anxiety and anergia; those with primary depressed mood, guilt, ideas of reference and personality disorders seldom respond. There is great variation in the interval between the first administration of these drugs and clinical response, and this may account for the inconsistencies in published trials. The type of drug and its dose may affect rate of response, as may biochemical factors, including acetylator and monoamine oxidase status. To obtain maximum benefit, a course of therapy with MAOIs should last for several months.\n",
      "Urinary gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, an indicator of renal ischaemic injury and homograft rejection. Gammaglutamyl transpeptidase is an enzyme primarily located in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney. Its unique localisation in the renal cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay provides the rationale for its use in the measurement of renal ischaemic injury. Using a standard experimental animal model, canine urinary gamma-GT activity was shown to be increased up to 70-fold following 90 min of unilateral renal ischaemia and was significantly raised following only 5 min ischaemia. The urinary gamma-GT was used as a measure of ischaemic injury associated with renal transplantation in man and 20 consecutive patients undergoing kidney transplant were studied by daily 24-hour urinary gamma-GT estimations and excellent correlation was obtained between raised enzyme activity and the clinical diagnosis of transplant rejection.\n",

      "Tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase: distribution in discrete areas of the rat limbic system. Tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase have been measured in 34 discrete areas and nuclei of the limbic system of the rat. Both enzymes showed an uneven distribution in this system. The ratio between tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activities showed a significant correlation when compared with the ratio of dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations for the areas studied. The results strongly suggest that dopaminergic terminals are present in discrete areas of the limbic cortex, and several septal and amygdaloid nuclei, and allow the precise localization of dopaminergic and noradrenergic areas in the limbic system.\n",
      "Resolution, specificity and transphosphorylase activity of calcifying cartilage alkaline phosphatases. The phosphate releasing activity from calf scapula cartilage was resolved by DEAE-cellulose chromatography into two distinct phosphatase activities. The activity eluted first from the column (phosphatase I) was active towards a variety of phosphate esters and several linear oligo phosphates including sodium pyrophosphate, while the second phosphatase activity (phosphatase II) was active only towards simple phosphate esters. Phosphatase I acted towards oligo phosphates in a stepwise fashion hydrolyzing one phosphate at a time. Both phosphatase are sialoproteins and can transfer phosphate from any of their substrates into other than water phosphate acceptor molecules such as glycerol. By several criteria, it can be concluded that the two phosphatases are different enzyme entities.\n",

Using radioactive substrate, thin-layer chromatography and recrystallization methods as well as differential centrifugation, gel filtration and electrophoresis, testosterone metabolism was investigated in male rat epiphyseal growth plate. 5alpha-androstane 3alpha-17beta-diol was found to be a major metabolite in vitro; lesser amounts of androstenedione and androstanedione, and a very small amount of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone were also identified. Radioactivity was recovered in epiphyseal subcellular fractions 30 minutes following in vivo administration of tritiated 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone; within 2 hours radioactivity had fallen to essentially background level in all fractions but the cytosol. A testosterone binding protein could not be identified within epiphyseal cytosol.\n",
      "Studies related to antitumor antibiotics. Part V. Reactions of mitomycin C with DNA examined by ethidium fluorescence assay. The cytotoxic action of the antitumor antibiotic mitomycin C occurs primarily at the level of DNA. Using highly sensitive fluorescence assays which depend on the enhancement of ethidium fluorescence only when it intercalates duplex regions of DNA, three aspects of mitomycin C action on DNA have been studied: (a) cross-linking events, (b) alkylation without necessarily cross-linking, and (c) strand breakage. Cross-linking of DNA is determined by the return of fluorescence after a heat denaturation step at alkaline pH's. Under these conditions denatured DNA gives no fluorescence. The cross-linking was independently confirmed by S1-endonuclease (EC 3.1.4.-) digestion. At relatively high concentrations of mitomycin the suppression of ethidium fluorescence enhancement was shown not to be due to depurination but rather to alkylation, as a result of losses in potential intercalation sites. A linear relationship exists between binding ratio for mitomycin and loss of fluorescence. The proportional decrease in fluorescence with pH strongly suggests that the alkylation is due to the aziridine moiety of the antibiotic under these conditions. A parallel increase in the rate and overall efficiency of covalent cross-linking of DNA with lower pH suggests that the cross-linking event, to which the primary cytotoxic action has been linked, occurs sequentially with alkylation by aziridine and then by carbamate. Mitomycin C, reduced chemically, was shown to induce single strand cleavage as well as monoaklylation and covalent cross-linking in PM2 covalently closed circular DNA. The inhibition of this cleavage by superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), and by free radical scavengers suggests that the degradation of DNA observed to accompany the cytotoxic action of mitomycin C is largely due to the free radical O2. In contrast to the behavior of the antibiotic streptonigrin, mitomycin C does not inactivate the protective enzymes superoxide dismutase or catalase. Lastly, mitomycin C is able to cross-link DNA in the absence of reduction at pH 4. This is consistent with the postulated cross-linking mechansims.\n",
      "Acid proteases from species of Mucor. III. Interaction with concanavalin A and concanavalin A Sepharose. The reaction of Mucor miehei protease with concanavalin A was followed by a turbidimetric assay in the pH range 5-8. At pH 4.0, no turbidity developed but binding of the enzyme to concanavalin A could be demonstrated by gel filtration. Two fractions of apparent molecular weight 65000 and 52000 were isolated, the 65000 molecular weight species apparently representing a protomer of concanavalin A (24000) bound to the enzyme. An analysis of the circular dichroism spectrum of this complex suggested that protomer binding results in a conformational change in the enzyme which is associated with a 30% increase in proteolytic activity. At pH 6.0, the enzyme was strongly bound to columns of concanavalin A Sepharose but could be removed by including alpha-methyl D-glucoside and NaC1 in the elution buffer. Some column degradation occurred at room temperature but was not detectable at 4 degrees C where rapid elution of the enzyme resulted in a greater than 90% yield of highly active protein. Periodate-oxidized Mucor miehei protease and Mucor renin did not react with concanavalin A and were not bound to the affinity column.\n",
      "Physical, chemical, and enzymatic studies on the major sucrase of honey bees (Apis mellifera). A sucrase from honey bees (Apis mellifera) which precipitates between ammonium sulfate saturations of 50 and 70% (5 mg protein per millilitre) and which makes up the major portion of the sucrases of honey bees was purified to homogeneity as shown by several criteria. A large part of the sucrase was found in the head while most of the rest was in the abdomen (a small amount was in the thorax). The enzyme precipitated between the same values of ammonium sulfate saturation as did the sucrase in honey and honey sucrase exhibited kinetics very similar to those of this enzyme. The enzyme was found to be a relatively nonspecific alpha-glucosidase and was shown to have transglucosidase activity. The production of glucose from sucrose was rectilinear when plotted by the Hofstee method at low substrate concentrations but decreased at high sucrose concentrations. The production of fructose was rectilinear throughout the concentration range used. The production of both glucose and rho-nitrophenol when rho nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucoside was the substrate was linear by the Hofstee plot. These effects were found to be due to transglucolysis and a mechanism of action is proposed. Amino acid and amino sugar analyses indicated that the sucrase was a glycoprotein. The molecular weight was found to be between 51000 and 82000 by three different methods and an so20.w value of 4.0 S was obtained. There was no evidence for subunit structure. Tests of the enzyme under various denaturation conditions did not reveal any unusual stabilities. The sucrase bound very tightly to a hydrophobic column. Iodoacetic acid decreased the activity of the sucrase but a large concentration was needed to bring about a 50% activity loss. Reducing agents caused some activity declines. Diethyl pyrocarbonate activated the enzyme.\n",
      "Studies on the formation by rat brain preparations of CDP-diglyceride from CTP and phosphatidic acids of varying fatty acid compositions. The enzyme, CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase (EC2.7.7.41) which catalyses formation of CDP-diglyceride from CTP and phosphatidic acid has been studied in rat brain preparations and other tissues. Improvement, as judged by the higher tissue activities obtained, in the assay method for this enzyme was achieved through use of phosphatidic acids sonicated in buffer-detergent solution saturated with ether and containing bovine serum albumin and use of short incubation times which essentially provided a measure of initial rates. The enzyme of rat brain microsomes yielded with 1,2-dioleolphosphatidic acid as substrate a pH optimum of 6.8 with maleate buffer and optimal concentrations of 60mM for MG2+, 6MM for CTP and 250 mug per 0.8 ml for phosphatidic acid. Enzyme activity was mainly located in the 90,000 X g fraction (microsomal) with small but significant activity in the 12,000 X g fraction. Comparison of activities (nanomoles CTP incorporated per milligram protein per minute) amongst tissues showed the following order: brain, 1.87; liver, 1.32; lung, 1.19; small intestine, 1.00; kidney, 0.69; heart, 0.41; diaphragm, 0.07; skeletal muscle, 0.02. Examination of the effect of varying the fatty acid composition in the phosphatidic acids added exogenously gave the following order (activities in parentheses); 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl- (5.58), 1-oleoyl-2-stearoyl- (5.37), 1,2-dioleoyl- (4.49) 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-(3.85), 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-(3.31), 1-arachidonoyl-2-stearoyl-(3.16), 1,2-diarachidonoyl-(0.72), 1,2-dicaproyl-(0.67), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-(0.67) and 1,2-distearoyl-(0.18). The single bis- and lysophosphatidic acids tested were inactive as substrates. Apart from a possible preference for one or more unsaturated fatty acids the transferase enzyme showed no selectivity in respect to the fatty acid distribution of phosphatidic acids.\n",
      "Effect of metiamide on acid secretion from isolated kitten fundic mucosa. Isolated kitten fundic mucosa demonstrates low rates of spontaneous acid secretion in vitro when bathed in Krebs-Henseleit solution, and responds consistently to histamine, pentagastrin, and acetylcholine placed in the bath. High rates of spontaneous secretion or secretion in response to histamine and pentagastrin were significantly inhibited by addition of metiamide (5 X 10(-3) M); but mucosa stimulated by constant addition of acetylcholine chloride (10(-4) M) was not inhibited by metiamide at the same concentration.\n",
      "Myoplasmic impedance of the barnacle muscle fiber. Myoplasmic impedance was measured on a barnacle (Balanus nubilus) single muscle fiber that was placed in a cylindrical cavity to limit the volume and prevent the hydration of the myoplasm. At both ends of the cavity, the myoplasm was in direct contact with an electrolyte solution. When equilibrium with the external medium was reached, the myoplasmic impedance was measured at 10 degrees C with an impedance bridge at 1000 Hz. The results indicated that the myoplasmic impedance of the muscle fiber is mainly resistive. Treating the myoplasm as a suspension of small conductive particles, we deduced the specific conductivity of the contractile filaments kf and their volume fraction rho (kf = 2.78 X 10(-3) omega-1cm-1, and rho = 0.48). The experimental technique permits an estimate of the specific myoplasmic conductivity in vivo (6.27 X 10(-3) omega-1cm-1). Finally, a decrease in the pH of the external solution from 10.1 to 4.0 lowered the myoplasmic conductivity by 16%. This may be considered as indirect evidence that the conductivity of the contractile filaments is associated with the protein counter-ions, since Hinke et al. (1973. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 204, 274-296.) reported evidence that a lowering of pH decreases the number of counter-ions.\n",
      "Pulmonary edema and ascorbic acid loss. Loss of ascorbic acid from lung and pulmonary edema were produced in mice by intravenous injection of either adrenaline or noradrenaline (5 mumol/kg). While adrenalectomy performed before noradrenaline administration reduced the degree of pulmonary edema, a prior dose of hexamethonium accentuated this effect. Given alone, hexamethonium caused both loss of ascorbic acid and pulmonary edema. The results show that although endogenous catecholamines can potentiate the pulmonary edema produced by either adrenaline or noradrenaline, they play no specific role in the ascorbic acid loss. The evidence suggests that lung ascorbic acid levels are decreased following the development of pulmonary edema, irrespective of how it was caused.\n",
      "Development of amino acid uptake activity in Neurospora. During the germination and growth of Neurospora conidia, amino acid permease systems I (neutral) and II (general) increase in specific activity. System III (basic) decreases in specific activity with the onset of germination. System I shows two peaks of activity during the logarithmic phase of growth. One peak occurs at 6 h, the other at 12 h of growth. Both peaks are abolished in the mtr mutant. Both peaks have a Km for phenylalanine of 40 muM. The peaks of system I activity appear to correlate with morphological changes.\n",
      "Production, purification and characterization of thermomycolase, the extracellular serine protease of the thermophilic fungus Malbranchea pulchella var. sulfurea. The thermophilic fungus Malbranchea pulchella produces a single extracellular, alkaline, serine protease when grown at 45 degrees C, on 2% casein as sole carbon source. The growth-associated production of protease in submerged cultures was inhibited by addition of glucose, amino acids, or yeast extract. A simple four-step purification which yields homogeneous protease in 78% yield is described. The protease has an isoelectric point of 6.0, a pH optimum of 8.5, and is completely inhibited by serine protease inhibitors. A specificity study with small synthetic ester substrates indicated that the protease preferentially hydrolyzed bonds situated on the carboxyl side of aromatic or apolar amino acid residues which are not beta-branched, positively charged or of the D configuration. Peptidase substrates and others such as N-acetyl-L-tyrosine-ethyl ester were not hydrolyzed. The protease was stable over a broad range of pH (6.5-9.5 at 30 degrees C, 20 h), and was particularly thermostable (t1/2 = 110 min at 73 degrees C, pH 7.4) in the presence of Ca2+ (10 mM). Macromolecules and Ca2+ also provide protection against the significant autolysis which occurs at pure protease concentrations greater than 0.01 mg/mo, as well as against surface denaturation which is enhanced by the presence of a silicone antifoam agent. Hence the stability of protease in submerged cultures is rationalized.\n",
      "Biosynthesis of chloramphenicol in Streptomyces sp. 3022a. Identification of p-amino-L-phenylalanine as a product from the action of arylamine synthetase on chorismic acid. Products obtained from the action of arylamine synthetase on [G-14C]chorismic acid were fractionated by gel filtration and ion exchange column chromatography to yield a partially purified radioactive component with an arylamine function. From its ultraviolet absorption spectrum and thin-layer chromatographic behaviour the product was considered to be p-aminophenylalanine and the identification was confirmed by co-crystallization with an authentic specimen. Specific deamination of the product with L-amino-acid oxidase indicated that it was the L-epimer. These results strengthen previous evidence that arylamine synthetase is at a branch point in the shikimic acid pathway, specifically diverting intermediates to the synthesis of chloramphenicol.\n",
      "Uptake and efflux of succinic acid by uninduced mycelium of Claviceps purpurea. Claviceps purpurea PRL 1980 grew on partially dissociated succinic acid (pH 4) but not on fully dissociated succinic acid (pH 7.2). Myeclium suspended in 42 mM solution of partially ionized succinic acid (pH 4; 60.1% nonionized, 39% monoanion, and 0.9% dianion, K+ salt) over a period of 25 min accumulated more succinic acid carbon than mycelium suspended in highly ionized solution (pH 6.8; 0.01% nonionized, 4.8% monoanion, and 95% dianion). The greater accumulation from partially ionized solution was not attributable solely to metabolism of succinic acid nor to the lower external concentration of potassium ion. Rate of uptake by sodium azide and iodoacetate-treated mycelium was proportional to external concentration at least up to 200 mumol/ml. External potassium or sodium ion was not required for uptake by inhibited or uninhibited mycelium and external sodium ion and glucose did not allow concentration of succinic acid. The internal concentrations of succinic acid carbon expressed as succinic acid in cell water were about the same as the external concentrations. Uptake was not appreciably affected by extent of ionization of external succinic acid but accumulation was markedly affected. A plot of accumulated succinic acid carbon against external pH produced a bimodal curve with the two maxima corresponding to the maximal concentrations of nonionized and monoanion succinic acid. The bimodal curve probably results from overlapping of two separate curves; the nonionized form accumulating efficiently because of one interaction with the cell and the monoanion form accumulating efficiently because of another interaction. Uptake from concentrated solution is by diffusion and efflux is rapid but not complete. Efflux is not retarded by presence of phosphate in the external solution.\n",
      "Characterization of a nitrogen-fixing bacterial strain from the roots of Digitaria sanguinalis. Rates of nitrogen fixation of 3 to 10 g of N2 fixed per hectare per day were associated with root systems of Digitaria sanguinalis. A Gram-negative motile aerobic bacterial strain that was capable of N2 fixation was isolated from a washed root sample of one of these plants. Optimal growth and N2 fixation occurred at a pH of about 6.5, a temperature of 30-37 degrees C, and at a pO2 of about 0.01 atm. Increased rates of N2 fixation resulted when this strain was grown in mixed cultures with aerobic or facultative bacteria. Observations of cellular and cultural morphology and results of biochemical and physiological studies indicate that the isolate may be related to the Azotobacteraceae but that it is not identical with any of the members of this family. The importance of N2 fixation by this isolate in nature is unknown.\n",
      "Beta-glucanases in the yeast Cryptococcus albidus var. aerius. Production and separation of beta-glucanases in asynchronous cultures. beta-Glucanases were detected in cell-free extracts of the yeast Cryptococcus albidus var. aerius when grown on glucose as the sole carbon source. The production of beta-glucanases was followed in log-phase cells and stationary-phase cells; the maximal production of beta-(1 leads to 3) and beta-(1 leads to 6) glucanases takes place respectively in log-phase and stationary-phase cells. The results show that there are marked differences in the elution profiles on Sephadex G-50 of fractions containing beta-glucanase from cells grown for 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The possibility either of replacement changes in fractions containing beta-glucanase activity or of a different synthesis of each beta-glucanase during the growth of the yeast is discussed. The results suggest that all fractions containing beta-glucanases hydrolyze both beta-(1 leads to 3) and beta-(1 leads to 6) linkages. Evidence in support of the conclusion that a low molecular form of beta-glucanase has a molecular weight of 2100 +/- 100 is also shown.\n",
      "Temperature-pH effect upon germination of bacterial spores. Using several kinds of criteria for the germination of bacterial spores, germination-pH curves were drawn for Bacillus subtilis spores observed at different temperatures. The experiments revealed that optimum pH for spore germination was markedly changed by changing the incubation temperature; the optimum pH for germination was 7.4 at 37 degrees C and 5.4 at 10 degrees C. A possible mechanism involved in this phenomenon is discussed.\n",
      "Effect of variou cultural conditions on the fatty acid and lipid composition of Choanephora cucurbitarum. The fatty acid composition of the total and polar lipid fractions of Choanephora cucurbitarum grown under different cultural conditions were analyzed by thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography. It was observed that temperature, age, pH, and light influenced the degree of unsaturation, this being due mainly to changes in the gamma-linolenic acid concentration. The conditions used in this study did not alter the qualitative profile of fatty acids normally present in the organism. Neither did these conditions stimulate the production of further long-chain fatty acids (C20-C26) beyond gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3) as reported earlier using growth media containing glutamic acid. The fatty acid pattern of lipid fractions though the same qualitatively, differed quantitatively. The polar lipid fractions, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and diphosphatidyl glycerol showed an appreciable variation in gamma-linolenic acid content under different cultural conditions. The degree of unsaturation of the various lipid fractions decreased with increases in temperature, light intensity, and pH, but within each treatment the same pattern of decreasing degree of unsaturation with increasing age was observed. The significance of these observations is discussed.\n",
      "Superficial cell-wall layers on Spirillum \"Ordal\" and their in vitro reassembly. The cell envelope of Sporillum sp. strain \"Ordal\" (possibly a variety of S. anulus) demonstrated multiple superficial wall layers which were diverse in their macromolecular arrays. Negative staining and freeze-etching techniques revealed an outer hexagonally packed layer and an inner tetragonally packed layer. However, both thin sections and freeze-etched cleavages of the wall showed that each of these regular structures rested upon a backing layer, and that there was a delicate amorphous layer overlying the outer hexagonal array. Rotary integration, optical deffraction, and reconstruction of image were used to clarify measurements of each array and to verify the validity of a diagrammatic model of the outer hexagonal system. The integrity of these layers required suitable cations (Ca2+ appeared essential) and pH (pH less than or equal to 4.6 dissociated most superficial layers). These observations aided in the development of a low-pH cationic-substitution technique, in which Na+ replaced essential Ca2+, for extraction of the layers from the cell surface. Dialysis to remove Na+ and restoration of Ca2+ initiated in vitro reassembly of the superficial layer components until regularly structured assembly products were formed.\n",
      "Premature labour. Prematurity is by far the commonest cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The management of premature labour is empirical because little is understood about the mechanism of labour. Effective uterine relaxant drugs have an important, albeit minor role. Phototherapy has reduced the complications of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and the beneficial effect of antepartum corticosteroid therapy in minimizing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome is now convincing. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy in premature rupture of the membranes does not alter perinatal mortality, although postpartum maternal morbidity is reduced. The introduction of neonatal intensive care units has improved the survival rate of premature infants. Sound clinical judgement remains the mainstay in the management of premature labour.\n",
      "Liver metastases found by follow-up of patients operated on for colorectal cancer. One hundred and twenty-six patients earlier operated on for colorectal cancer were followed-up once yearly with serum screening tests. The activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and gammaglutamyltranspeptidase (GT) were recorded. 58 patients had positive tests. The majority of the patients with liver metastases (20/21) was possible to encircle with these simple serum tests. 38 of the 58 \"screening positive patients\" were further investigated with celiac angiography and/or liver scintigraphy and liver metastases were very suspect in 29 of these patients. 18 of them were laparotomized and the suspicion was verified in 8.7 of these patients could be subjected to surgery against their liver tumours and 2 of them have then survived more than 2 years. The authors suggest a follow-up system with shorter interval between the examinations.\n",
      "Carcinoembryonic antigen and phosphohexose isomerase, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase and lactate dehydorgenase levels in patients with and without liver metastases. Plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and serum enzyme levels of phosphohexose isomerase (PHI), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (psi-GTP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured in 147 patients with malignancy. Levels were higher in patients (particularly with G.I., breast and lung cancers) than in normals or in patients with cancer in clinical remission. Elevations of CEA and of all three enzymes in blood were most frequent in patients with hepatic metastases. CEA elevations correlated directly with PHI levels. Seventy-eight percent of patients with metastatic G.I. cancer could be identified by CEA (greater than 5 ng/ml) alone, as well as 38% with breast cancer and 85% with lung cancer; but only 17% of other cancers could be identified by CEA alone. CEA or one or more enzymes was elevated in 64% of metastatic breast cancer patients, 92% of lung cancer and 41% of other cancers, but enzyme measurement did not increase identification of G.I. cancer over that achieved by CEA alone. These findings suggest that circulating levels of CEA, PHI, psi-GTP and LDH may reflect a direct contribution from the malignant tissue and/or liver malfunction secondary to liver replacement.\n",
      "Controlled environment culture of bone marrow explants from human myeloma. Bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with myeloma were cultured in either 1 of 2 thin-film culture systems, a controlled environment steady state system or a rocker tube configuration of the system, for periods up to 42 days. Both functional and morphological characteristics of the myeloma cells were well-maintained in these systems. Cytocentrifuge preparations of the culture media disclosed hematopoietic cells that included from 5% to almost 100% plasma cells. Histological examination of the cultured specimens disclosed infiltration of the marrow with myeloma cells. Myeloma proteins were released at a steady rate throughout the period of culture after the 1st 4 days. Bone-resorbing activity was demonstrated in the culture media in 7 of 9 myeloma culture media and was well maintained, particularly during the 1st week of culture. This activity was associated with severe osteolytic lesions in the donor patient and marked infiltration of the cultured specimen by myeloma cells. The potential use of these organ culture systems for the further definitive identification of the factor responsible for bone destruction in myeloma is discussed.\n",
      "Binding of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea to L1210 cell nuclear proteins. The binding of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(cyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) to the proteins of the L1210 cell nucleus has been studied using both [cyclohexyl-14C]CCNU and [chloroethyl-14C]CCNU. Most of the bound [cyclohexyl-14C] moiety of CCNU was found to exist in a form that was stable in acid solution but labile and dialyzable in alkaline solution. A small amount of the cyclohexyl moiety was bound to histones in a stable, nondialyzable form. The drug/protein ratio for the H1 histone was about 0.01 to 0.02 mole/mole. No binding of the cyclohexyl group to acidic proteins or of the chloroethyl group to either histones or acidic proteins was observed. Thus, the interaction of CCNU with the proteins of the cell nucleus can be defined in terms of the modification of histones by the cyclohexyl moiety.\n",
      "31P nuclear magnetic resonance-pH titrations of myo-inositol hexaphosphate. With the use of 31P n.m.r. spectroscopy, the separate pKa values of each of the six phosphoric monoester groups of myo-inositol hexaphosphate were determined. The range of hydrogen-ion concentrations covered extended from that required for the phosphonium salts to that for the full dodecyl anion, and the determinations were carried out in the presence of sodium and tetrabutylammonium cations. The pKa for each phosphate grouping in the transition from the free acid forms of each group to the monoanion form of each group was determined to be: 1.1, C-2; 1.5, C-1 and C-3; 2.1, C-4 and C-6; and 1.7, C-5. In the mono- to di-anion transition, the pKa values were: 6.85, C-2; 7.60, C-5; 5.70 and 12.0, C-1 and C-3; and 10.0, C-4 and C-6. These data and the appearance of the 31P hexaphosphate n.m.r. multiplet are discussed in terms of conformations of myo-inositol hexaphosphate.\n",
      "Age dependence of the number of the stem cells in haemopoietic tissues of rats. The number and concentration of haemopoietic stem cells in the femoral bone marrow and spleen of Wistar rats of different ages were investigated. Stem cells were assayed by the spleen colony technique in irradiated rat recipients. The ability of the recipient spleen to harvest transplanted tissue as a macroscopic colony was found to be dependent on the recipient's age. Changes with senescence were observed also in the concentration and the size of the stem cell compartment both in the marrow and spleen. No differences were demonstrated in the seeding of transplanted colony-forming units into the spleen of recipients of 1 and 4 months of age. A rats-mice strain difference in the effect of senescence on the haemopoietic stem cells is discussed.\n",
      "Kinetics of haemopoietic recovery in endotoxin-treated mice. Kinetics of mouse spleen colony forming units were studied after intra-peritoneal injection of 1 mug/blody weight bacterial endotoxin S. typhosa. When these mice were used as unirradiated and sublethally irradiated donors, it was possible to study the effect of the endotoxin injection upon the cells. Use of the treated mice as irradiated recipients of normal cells gave information about the host effect. In treated unirradiated mice, the total nucleated cell and the CFU counts were disturbed, and 2 days later a large fraction of the CFU were found in the DNA synthesis (S) phase. This meant that injection of endotoxin generated factors affecting the kinetics of the CFU and triggering the resting CFU into the proliferative cycle. If then the mice were given supralethal irradiation and used as recipients of normal bone marrow cells, more CFU seeded to the spleen as compared to normal recipients; but the dip and the growth rate of the CFU were not changed. Hence the endotoxin-generated factors had been eliminated in 2 days. A total body sublethal irradiation by 400 rad X-ray 2 days after endotoxin injection reduced the post-irradiation dip in the recovery curve of the CFU, indicating that though the factors affecting the cell kinetics had been eliminated, the cycling CFU behaved like a growing population. During the first week, the growth rate of the CFU remained the same as in control irradiated mice. The growth rate of the spleen CFU of the endotoxin-treated mice slowed down during the second week, and their self-replicating ability was low. Fluctuations in the DNA synthesizing fraction of the spleen CFU suggested a variability in the ratio of the length of the S phase and the cell generation time.\n",

In rabbits whose pancreatic ducts were ligatured, significant pH changes were observed in the anterior parts of the digestive tract (antrum and duodenum) but not in the posterior parts (jejunum and ileum) as could have been expected. These changes do not seem to be directly related to the lack of pancreatic juice, which leads one to think that, in the rabbit this secretion only plays a very limited role in the neutralisation processes.\n",

      "Activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in serum of patients receiving anticonvulsant of anticoagulant therapy. 1. Effects of chronic anticoagulant therapy in heart patients and anticonvulsant therapy in epileptics on gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in serum were investigated. 2. The enzyme was elevated in 22% of 18 patients receiving anticoagulants. In these patients prothrombin time was also abnormally high. 3. 84% of 65 epileptics exhibited elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, 67% of which were not associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase or aspartate aminotransferase activities. In these latter cases, involvement of the liver was not apparent. 4. Possible relationships of anticonvulsant mediated enzyme induction or hepatic toxicity to elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in serum in epileptics is discussed.\n",
      "Human saliva peroxidase: microanalytical isoelectric fractionation and properties in normal persons and in cases with neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis. Human saliva contains a high peroxidase activity that can be estimated spectrophotometrically with the hydrogen donor p-phenylenediamine and the substrate hydrogen peroxide from 20 mul of material. The pH optimum of the enzyme with citrate-phosphate buffer is 5.5. After microanalytical isoelectric fractionation 3 main isoenzyme components at pI 8.6, 6.5 and 4.3, and a number of isoenzyme subfractions at pI 9.5, 7.3 and 3.8 are detectable. In 3 patients with the juvenile form of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (type Spielmeyer-Vogt), in which a deficiency of leukocyte peroxidase had been reported by other authors, both the total activity of saliva peroxidase and the activity of individual isoenzymes were found to be within normal limits. These findings are not consistent with a generalized peroxidase deficiency in this disease.\n",
      "Theoretical approaches to estimation of plasma renin activity: a review and some original observations. Performance of accurrate, reproducible, and interpretable assays for plasma renin activity and other components of the renin/angiotensin system in the clinical setting requires a clear understanding of the various reactions in the renin/angiotensin cascade and the nature of their interactions. Plasma renin activity, the rate of angiotensin generations from plasma incubated in vitro, is the most commonly used clinical index of function in the renin/angiotensin system. Renin activity is measured by radioimmunoassay of angiotensin I generated in vitro under carefully controlled conditions. The value obtained for plasma renin activity depends on pH and duration of incubation and on the method used to protect the angiotensin I generated. We recommend incubation at neutral pH in buffered plasma for three hours in the presence of either ethylenediaminetetraacetate + 8-hydroxyquinolone + dimercaprol or ethylenediaminetetraacetate + phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Addition of a standard preparation of human renin to the plasma incubation step of the renin activity assay serves the dual purpose of permitting measurement of renin activity and furnishing an internal standard for comparison of assay procedures. The many variables among renin assay methods can be cancelled by referring to a common internal renin standard.\n",
      "Improved specificity of serum albumin determination and estimation of \"acute phase reactants\" by use of the bromcresol green reaction. The reaction of serum samples with bromcresol green proceeds in two steps. Albumin is responsible for the faster (less than 1 min) reaction; the slower (30-min) reaction is a measure of \"acute phase reactant(s)\" in serum. Serum is simply mixed with bromcresol green reagent and the absorbance is measured twice, immediately and at 60 min. Albumin concentrations, determined from the absorbance at 0 min, correlate well with those determined by Laurell \"rocket\" immunoelectrophoresis; r = 0.95 with no certain deviation from unity for the slope and with a negligible difference at zero concentration. The slow reaction was expressed as deltaA% = 100 (deltaAs/deltaAv) where deltaAs and delta Av are the changes in absorbance between 60 and 0 min for the sample and a commercial control serum, respectively. The value for deltaA% correlates well with the percentage of alpha2-fraction as determined by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate, as well as with orosomucoid and ceruloplasmin, all of which are acute phase reactant(s). Whether these proteins or other acute phase reactant(s) actually cause the slow reaction has not yet been established.\n",
      "Evaluation of lipase activity in serum by radial enzyme diffusion. Results of determination of serum lipase by radial enzyme diffusion correlate well with those by a titrimetric reference method in the abnormal range. The specificity of the diffusion assay allows the differentiation of patients with pancreatic disease, even when the lipase activity of the serum is within the normal limits of the tritrimetric assay. Pancreatic lipase is not detectable by the diffusion assay in the serum of individuals who are free from pancreatic disease.\n",
      "Creatine kinase in serum: 1. Determination of optimum reaction conditions. To establish optimum conditions for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) activity measurement with the creatine phosphate in equilibrium creatine reaction, we re-examined all kinetics factors relevant to an optimal and standardized enzyme assay at 30 and 25 degrees C. We determined the pH optimum in vaious buffers, considering the effect of the type and concentration of the buffer, as well as the influence of various buffer anions on the activity. The relation between activity and substrate concentration was shown and the apparent Michaelis constants of creatine kinase for creatine phosphate and ADP were evaluated. We tested the effect on creatine kinase measurement of the concentration of substrates (glucose and NADP+) in the auxillary and indicator reactions, especially the influence of the added auxiliary (hexokinase) and indicator (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) enzymes on the lag phase, at different temperatures. The NADP+ concentration proved to be the factor limiting the duration of constant reaction rate. We studied the inhibition of creatine kinase and adenylate kinase by AMP and established a convenient AMP concentration. For reactivation of creatine kinase, N-acetyl cysteine as sulfhydryl compound was introduced. Finally, we examined the relationship between activity and temperature.\n",
      "Radioiodination of human low density lipoprotein: a comparison of four methods. A comparison has been made of four labelling techniques used to radioiodinate human low density lipoprotein (LDL). (1) Chloramine T iodination at pH 7.4 was 20-25% efficient and gave a product immunologically indistinguishable from native LDL. Approximately 30% of the incorporated radioactivity, however, was found in LDL lipids, and the metabolic decay of the labelled complex in rats did not obey first order kinetics. Radiolabelling at pH 10 reduced the uptake of 125I into lipids to 10% but also cut the overall incorporation of radioiodine by a factor of 7. (2) Lactoperoxidase labelling and (3) conjugation with iodinated N-succinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate were highly efficient (100%), but incorporation of radioactivity into the lipid moiety was unacceptably high (approximately 30%). (4) The efficiency of iodine monochloride labelling was highly reproducible and the product was immunologically indistinguishable from native LDL. Incorporation of radioactivity into the lipid moiety was less than 4% when the I/protein ratio of the product was kept at or below 1 : 1. Decay of the radiolabelled LDL in rats was monoexponential.\n",
      "Purification and properties of human acid-thermostable ribonucleases, and diagnosis of childhood pancreatic fibrosis. Acid-thermostable ribonucleases were isolated from human pancreas, duodenal contents, liver, spleen, serum and urine, and purified 15--1000-fold. The pH optima, ionic requirements, and some of the specificity requirements, of these enzymes were investigated. The isolated enzymes formed two distinct groups: (a) The ribonucleases of the pancreas, duodenal contents and fraction A of serum and urine exhibit a pH optimum of 8.5, are inhibited by An2+ and Cu2+, and relatively rapidly hydrolyze the synthetic substrate uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate); (b) the ribonucleases of the liver and spleen, and of fractions B of the serum and urine, with a pH optimum of 7, are less sensitive to An2+ and Cu2+, and exhibit negligible activity versus uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate). Determination of the serum level of pancreatic-type ribonuclease activity, with the use of uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate) or RNA as substrates, appears to be a valid diagnostic tool for pancreatic fibrosis in children.\n",

In the present report, certain properties of phosphoglucose isomerase from the ovine liver E. granulosus protoscolices have been studied and compared with those of the hydatid cyst fluid and the healthy ovine liver enzymes. The protoscolices enzyme prepared in a manner similar to the hydatid cyst fluid and the ovine liver enzymes exhibited the following properties: (1) pH optimum of 8.2 (2) KM value of 0.23 mM, (3) the enzyme was inhibited in the presence of high concentrations of alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate, (4) no detectable inhibition of the enzyme was observed in the presence of phosphate ion up to 4.1 mM, (5) the protoscolices enzyme was less thermostable as compared to the hydatid cyst fluid and the ovine liver enzymes, (6) the protoscolices enzyme had a lower Ki value (0.7 mM) as compared to either the hydatid cyst fluid (1.1 mM) or the ovine liver enzymes (4.6 mM) when 6-phosphogluconic acid was used as a competitive inhibitor.\n",
      "Biochemical differences between the MB and MM isoenzymes of creatine kinase. The biochemical properties of partially purified preparations of human myocardial MB and MM iosenzymes of creatine kinase have been compared with one another. Differences in substrate affinity, behaviour with inhibitors, and heat denaturation have been demonstrated. It is doubtful if the differences we have shown are sufficiently great to form the basis of a practical routine procedure for measuring serum levels of the MB isoenzyme.\n",
      "The estimation of phospholipids in bile. Total and lipid phosphorus were measured in the duodenal aspirate of 24 fasting subjects following an injection of cholecystokinin. The lipid phosphorus values were lower than the total phosphorus, a difference most pronounced in dilute samples. Storage at -20 degrees C over 4 weeks resulted in a loss of over 50% lipid phosphorus. Such alterations in the lipid phosphorus affected the calculation of biliary phospholipid and hence the saturation index of cholesterol in bile causing it to be erroneously elevated. It is concluded that analysis of bile samples should be undertaken on freshly obtained samples and include a preliminary step for the extraction of lipids.\n",
      "Two alpha-glucosidases in cultured amniotic fluid cells and their differentiation in the prenatal diagnosis of Pompe's disease. A sensitive fluorometric assay utilizing 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside has been developed for the determination of alpha-glucosidase. The enhanced sensitivity was achieved by increasing the solubility of the substrate with a water miscible organic solvent. With this system, cultured amniotic fluid cells were found to have two major forms of alpha-glucosidase with somewhat overlapping acidic pH optima; one with pH optimum at 4.5 is deficient in Pompe's disease (type II glycogenosis), while one with pH optimum at 6.0 is not affected in this disease. Specificity for the pH 4 form of alpha-glucosidase was achieved by exploiting the greater thermal lability of the pH 6 enzyme. The pH 6 form of the enzyme was also detectable in freshly prepared extracts of cultured fibroblasts. The procedure is direct and simple and has been applied to the prenatal diagnosis in two pregnancies at risk for Pompe's disease.\n",
      "X-linked ichthyosis, bilateral cryptorchidism, hypogenitalism and mental retardation in two siblings. Two brothers showed ichthyosis, bilateral cryptorchidism, hypogenitalism and mental retardation. In addition, the younger brother had short stature associated with disorders of secretions of insulin, ACTH and GH. This is the third reported case of the syndrome of ichthyosis and hypogonadism.\n",
      "A simple method for the cryopreservation of lymphocytes. Retention of specific immune effector functions by frozen-stored cells. A simple, quick and inexpensive method for cryostorage of lymphocytes is discribed. When injected into appropriate normal recipients, frozen-stored rat and sheep lymphocytes caused GVH and NLT reactions respectively. Sheep lymphocytes remained viable after several months storage and functioned satisfactorily as 51Cr-labelled target cells in assays for cytotoxic antibodies. Lymphocytes, including immunoblasts, drained from sheep efferent lymphatics during immune responses to injected murine P815 cells or allogeneic lymphocytes survived freezing; when thawed the cells retained specific immune cytotoxic effector functions including the ability to secrete complement-dependent and leucocyte-dependent antibodies\n",
      "Mechanism of post dialysis hyperventilation in  patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain postdialysis hypocapnia. Three were tested in this study: impairment of tissue oxygenation by dialysis (D)-induced alkalosis (Bohr effect), the D disequilibrium syndrome, and the loss of carbon dioxide  (CO2) in D fluid. In 17 patients pre-DPCO2 was significantly correlated with plasma bicarbonate concentration (HCO3) and no disproportionate reduction of PCO2 was discernible. In 10 patients using a bath acetate concentration of 38 mEq/1 PCO2 was unchanged after D (35.4 versus 35.9 mm Hg before D), and was low relative to HCO3 whic increased from 21.2 to 28.0 mEq/1. After a dialysis using an acetate concentration of 25 mEq/1 HCO3 remained constant (20.4 versus 21.1 mEq/1 pre-D), whereas PCO2 fell from 35.3 to 30.8 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Consequently PCO2 was again low relative to HCO3. Removal of CO2 by D fluid was excluded as a cause for low blood PCO2: addition of gaseous CO2 to the bath had no influence on arterial blood gases. Since post-D hypocapnia was not prevented when HCO3 was kept constant, it was concluded that post-D alkalosis cannot be the main reason for post-D hyperventilation, and that other factors related to the process of D are responsible.\n",
      "Duration of cardiac effects of timolol and propranolol. The duration of the cardiac effects of single intravenous doses of the beta-antagonists, timolol and propranolol, was compared in 6 healthy male subjects. Timolol and propranolol were given in doses of 1 mg and 10 mg, respectively, and at specified times after their administration, beta-blockade was assessed by the reduction of maximal exercise-induced tachycardia and by the inhibition of the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol. Inotropic effects were measured by changes in the pre-ejection period of left ventricular systole obtained from systolic time intervals. There was no statistically significant difference in the timolol and propranolol time-courses of beta-blockade. The change in exercise-tachycardia was maximal 5 min after beta-antagonist infusion but dissipated rapidly so that no statistically significant change was observed 9 hr later. The chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol were almost completely antagonized for 11/2 hr after beta-antagonist infusion, and significant beta-blockade could be demonstrated 9 hr later. There was no difference in the time-course of the negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of either beta-antagonist.\n",
      "Hypnotic efficacy of lorazepam and flurazepam. In a double-blind crossover study involving 15 insomniac subjects, the hypnotic efficacy of lorazepam, 2 and 4 mg, was compared with flurazepam, 15 and 30 mg, and placebo. Five subjective measures were used: onset, length, and depth of sleep, number of times awakened, and satisfaction with the hypnotic. Lorazepam in 2- and 4-mg doses was comparable in hypnotic efficacy to flurazepam, 30 mg, according to most parameters of measurement. Side effects were minor, although relatively numerous at the 4-mg doses.\n",
      "Acebultolol: basis for the prediction of effect on exercise tolerance. Twelve unselected males suffering from documented coronary insufficiency and moderately severe angina submitted to graded multistage treadmill exercise testing on 3 separate days, 3.5 hr after a single dose of 0,200, or 400 mg of acebulolol, a cardioselective beta blocker. Control measures included random allocation of 2 patients to each of 6 balanced sequences of administration, standardized double-blind conditions, and variance analysis for Latin-square design with repeated measures on each subject. Performance was evaluated by measuring time elapsed until anginal pain, peak heart rate, peak product of heart rate and blood pressure, and peak oxygen consumption. Mean values for all criteria were significantly atered by 400 mg of acebutolol. Seven out of twelve patients were classified as responders (i.e., exercise duration increased 100% or more). The response after acebutolol was correlated with the performance on placebo in the base of exercise duration, peak heart rate, and peak product of heart rate and blood pressure. It is concluded that: (1) performance criteria are useful predictors of response to beta blockade and (2) acebutolol is a potent antianginal agent when judged by an objective treadmill exercise test.\n",
      "Radiology in Mendelson's syndrome. Four cases of Mendelson's syndrome (acid pulmonary aspiration) are presented. They all demonstrate an acute diffuse alveolar filling pattern. This appearance is by no means specific. However, in the absence of other causes for this pattern and of evidence of left ventricular failure the radiologist may alert the clinician to the correct diagnosis. Early recognition of this syndrome will result in prompt treatment which differs significantly from that of other causes of this radiographic appearance. The differential diagnosis is discussed.\n",
      "Growth hormone secretion in acid-base alterations at rest and during exercise. 1. Seven healthy males were studied during cycle ergometer exercise at 33%, 66% and 90% of VO2 max. on three occasions when NH4C1, NaHCO3 or CaCO3 (as a control substance) were administered in gelatin capsules double blind and in randomized order. Plasma growth hormone (HGH), lactic acid and hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) were measured at frequent intervals. 2. Ammonium chloride produced highest blood [H+] and NaHCO3 the lowest. These differences were maintained during exercise and in recovery. Plasma lactic acid concentrations were similar at rest. At 66%, 90% VO2 max. and recovery lactic acid was highest with NaHCO3 and lowest with NH4C1. 3. Exercise stimulated HGH secretion in all studies and the elevation was proportional to the intensity of the exercise. NH4C1 caused a variable elevation of HGH at rest and 33% VO2 max. At 66% VO2 max., plasma HGH was significantly elevated to similar concentrations in all studies and, at 90% VO2 max., HGH was highest with NaHCO3. 4. An infusion of sodium L(+)-lactate producing plasma lactate concentrations of 3-5 mmol/l did not influence HGH secretion. 5. Exercise is a physiological stimulus to HGH secretion and the mechanism is independent of blood [H+] and lactate concentrations.\n",
      "The intracellular pH of human leucocytes in response to acid-base changes in vitro. 1. Viable human leucocytes were isolated from venous blood and suspended in artificial media. Intracellular pH measurements were made by the dimethyloxazolidinedione technique in conditions simulating \"respiratory\" or \"metabolic\" acid-base disturbances. 2. Normal intracellular pH was 7-11 +/- 0-02 (mean +/- 2 SD) at an extracellular PCO2 of 5-8 kPa and a bicarbonate concentration of 25 mmol/l. 3. \"Respiratory\" and \"metabolic\" acidosis caused little change in pHi although increases in PCO2 led to relatively greater falls in pHi than did reduction in external bicarbonate concentration. 4. \"Respiratory\" and \"metabolic\" alkalosis caused similar and relatively greater increases in the pHi when compared with the response to an external acidosis.\n",
      "Marrow transplantation in aplastic anemia and leukemia. Human marrow transplantation has resulted in observations of fundamental significance in understanding both aplastic anemia and acute leukemia. For example, the observation that transplanted marrow can grow successfully in patients with aplastic anemia indicates that the disease is due to a defect in the marrow precursor cells and not in the marrow microenvironment. Similarly, the observation of recurrent leukemia in donor cells has important implications. Nonetheless, marrow transplantation is sufficiently established therapeutically to be considered the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia, and a realistic alternative for patients with recurrent acute leukemia. We suggest that patients be managed with regard to marrow transplantation according to the general approach outlined in Table 3. Marrow transplantation and histocompatibility typing are available at increasing numbers of institutions throughout the world. More and more patients with either severe aplastic anemia or recurrent acute leukemia should have marrow transplantation available to them when it is indicated as part of optimal management of these no longer hopeless diseases.\n",
      "The objective and timing of drug disposition studies, appendix V. A comparison of the bioavailability of three dosage forms of terfenadine. Antagonistic effect against histamine-induced wheals was used to evaluate the bioavailability of terfenadine in monkeys. A rapidly dissolving tablet formulation of terfenadine shows essentially identical bioavailability to a liquid suspesion. A less readily dissolving capsule formulation lags considerably in time with regard to availability, and some question remains as to whether the total quantity in the capsule is available.\n",
      "The difficult hypertensive. With the wide range of medications available today it should be possible to obtain satisfactory control in the majority of hypertensive patients. However, there are various categories of patients who may present particular problems in management, as for example patients with cerebro-vascular and coronary disease, or with renal failure. A particularly important group is those presenting with severe resistant hypertension, and these patients may constitute about 5 to 10% of the hypertensive population. Considerations relevant to the management of patients presenting with such problems are discussed. Combined drug regimens employing clonidine or beta-blockers with peripheral vasodilators appear to be particularly useful.\n",
      "[Our experience with the method of D'Amour and Smith]. The authors carried out studies on a group of analgetic preparations (morphine, lydol, thylidine, pentazocine and analgine) by the method of D Amour and Smith, using thermic painful stimulation. The experiments were carried out on white rats-young and adult of both sexes of the strain Wistar. The mean lethal dosis were determined as well as the mean effective doses and therapeutic indices. The experimental results showed that thylidine was the strongest analgetic agent with atherapeutic index of 67. The index of morphine was 63 and was close to that of thylidine, but without statistical significance. The remaining analgetic indices were with low indices: lyndiol-with 5, pentazocine - 12 and analgine - 2. The method used, according to our data, could be applied successfully on rats of both sexes, at various age groups and both strains. The method is convenient for testing analgetic activity of preparations from two basic types of analgetic agents-narcotic and nonnarcotic.\n",
      "Persisting and unaltered circadian rhythms of six healthy young men with a night-work shift every 48 hrs and a 2% CO2 atmosphere during a 4-week span. Six apparently healthy young males (20 +/- 0.5 years of age) lived in a specially designed laboratory for a 1-week span in normal air, followed by 4 weeks in a 2% CO2 atmosphere and thereafter 1 week again in normal air. Room temperature was 24 degrees C. +/- 1 degrees C.; relative hygrometry 75% +/- 5%. With respect to socio-ecologic time clues and cues, the subjects were not isolated. The subjects' social synchronization was altered only by the shift-work schedule (light-on, 07(00); light-off, 22(30) on normal days). Every other day each subject had a 3-h night task, located between 23(00) and 07(00). Once a week, during 48 hrs (Saturday and Sunday) a set of physiologic variables was documented every 4 hrs in order to study their circadian changes: oral temperature, peak expiratory flow, grip strength, arterial blood pressure, tempo, and urinary pH, volume and potassium excretion. As far as rhythms are detectable (cosinor method) the most striking result is that both rhythm acrophases and amplitudes do not show any statistically significant changes when comparing either night-work versus day-work and/or normal air versus air with 2% CO2. Both 3 hrs of night-work every other day and an unusual amount of CO2 do not alter the parameters characterizing the circadian rhythms considered. The absence of desynchronization during night-work could be related to: 1) the speed of rotation in the shift-work; 2) the short duration of night-work; and 3) the youth of the subjects.\n",
      "[Blood sugar and hypoxic dynamics in metabolic acidosis and alkalosis (experimental data)]. The dynamics of the glucose concentration and arterovenous glucose gradient was examined during different metabolic deviations in the acid-base balance. The metabolitic acidosis increased the level of sugar in the blood. A definite influence on the latter had the gravity of the acidosis and to a certain degree its pathogenetic form. The arterio-venous glucose difference changed from negative to positive with the increase of proton activity. The type of the peripheral hypoxic structure, formed  during the state of acidosis influenced both the glucose gradient and its quantitative relations to the acid-base and oxygen indices. The sugar content in the blood during metabolitic alcalosis was not changed significantly. There was an increase in the arterio-venous gradient and inverse correlation between the glucose level and the arterio-venous oxygen difference with the increase of the bicarbonate concentration.\n",
      "[Effect of beta-adrenergic blockaders on the bioelectrical activity of the mesenchephalic reticular formation]. The authors examined the beta-adrenergic structures in the mesencephalic formation (MSF) in view of establishing their role on the activity of MSF in view of establishing the in rols on the activity of MSF itself and the relationship of the same formation with the cerebral cortex and the lymbic system. It was established that beta-adrenergic blockers after their local application in MSF could inhibit its function. The data from the effect on the induced bioelectrical activity indicated also diminution in the functional activity of MSF. The authors found that the inhibiting influences of beta-blockers were abolished by their antagonist isoprenalite. An inference is made that there are beta-adrenergic structures, which act excitatory.\n",
      "[Age-related changes in the content and characteristics of glycosaminoglycans in human aortas]. The vascular wall is rich in glucoseaminglicanes (GAG), which form the basic intercellular substance and determine its multiple functions. Using analytic and chromatographic methods the author examined hexauronic acid (HA), pentoses (P), sulphate groups and various derivatives of GAG (hyaluronic acid (HA), pentoses (P), sulphate groups and various derivatives of GAG (hyaluronic acid (HA), dermatan-sulfate (DS), keratansulfate (KS), chondroitinsulfate (HS), and cheransulfate (HES) in human aorta, obtained from persons at the age of 10 and over 70 years of age. Ten aortas of each group were examined. The studies showed that in the aortas of the adult persons the content of HA, P, HS, KS and sulphate groups was considerably higher than that of the aourtas, obtained form the young persons. There was an impression that the adult factor affected substantialy the qualitative characteristics of GAG--with advancement of age the lenght of polysaccharide chains was shortened and the degree of sulphatation was increased. The accumulation of acid GAG in the aorta of adult persons impaired the metabolism of substances between blood and tissue, which enhanced the infiltration of the blood vessels with lipids and proteins, especialy when there was a blood increase in their content (hyperlipemia, hypercholesterinemia, ect.)\n",
      "[Beta blockers as psychotropic drugs]. The range of indications for beta blocking substances has extended to various fields of pathology : vascular system, endocrinology... The discovery of some of their side effects give good reasons to try to find out whether they should have a place in psychopharmacotherapy and wheter they could meet its present requirements.  The initial target symptoms were anxiety--which, being polymorphous, can be, at various degrees, reactionnal to obviously stressing surroundings, but which is also implied by structural distortions of personality--and psychosomatic manifestations. If their site of actions was initially thought peripherical, it now seems that their action is also central, genuinely psychotropic, anxiolytic, and non sedative, psychoanaleptic and, at the same time, stimulating and increasing the level of attention (we have observed in some cases a reduction of sleep time)--thymoanaleptic, increasing the incitement to action. On the other hand, they quiet certain excitation states caused by appearence of badly controled anxieties. This study contains three series of experiments conceived with a similar methodology.\n",
      "Nuclear 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alphaOHD) activity for 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone in the rat prostate. The in vitro examination of adult male rat prostatic 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alphaOHD) activity using 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone4 as substrate indicates that significant levels of enzyme activity are associated with purified nuclei as well as with the cytosol fractions. Both the purified nuclear and the cytosol fractions exhibited higher levels of 3alphaOHD activity with NADH than with NADPH. The pH activity curves for the NADH and NADPH catalyzed reactions were different for both the nuclear and cytosol fractions. The results suggest the presence of a number of 3alphaOHD enzymes in rat prostate.\n",
      "Inhibition of pancreatic islet monoamine oxidase by adrenergic antagonists and ethanol. Although the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of intact animals, it either does not alter, or it inhibits in vitro insulin secretion. This may be because in the higher concentration used in in vitro studies, phentolamine exerts a second pharmacological effect that counterbalances its primary effect of blocking monoamine action. We recently demonstrated that pancreatic islets contain substantial amounts of monoamine oxidase (MAO), and that MAO inhibitors such as iproniazid and tranylcypromine can alter insulin secretion. In the present study, we determined if other drugs that affect insulin secretion, alter the MAO activity of homogenates of rabbit pancreatic islets (collagenase technique) or liver. Phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol (10 muM and 100 muM) inhibit islet and hepatic MAO. Haloperidol (10muM) inhibits hepatic but not islet MAO, while haloperidol (10muM) does not inhibit MAO in either tissue. Ethanol (270 to 2.7mM) inhibits islet MAO. Hepatic MAO is inhibited by high (270 to 180mM) but not by low (27 to 2.7mM) concentrations of ethanol. Collagenase digestion does not increase the sensitivity of islet and liver MAO to inhibition by phentolamine or ethanol. In the absence of added monoamines, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine do not alter basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from rabbit pancreas. Preincubation of rabbit pancreas with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) increases the beta cell serotonin content and inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Alpha adrenergic antagonists not only fail to block, but actually potentiate the serotonin inhibition of insulin secretion. We conclude that inhibition of islet MAO may cause an increase in islet monoamine content and these monoamines may alter in vitro insulin secretion. One mechanism through which adrenergic antagonists and ethanol modify in vitro insulin secretion may be by inhibiting pancreatic islet MAO.\n",
      "Distribution of releasing factors, biogenic amines, and related enzymes in the bovine median eminence. The bovine median eminence was dissected into eight different subdivisions: rostral, anterior internal, anterior external, middle external medial, middle external lateral, middle internal medial, middle internal lateral, and caudal. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was found in the highest concentrations in the middle external medial and lateral subdivisions; luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was concentrated in the middle external lateral and anterior internal subdivisions. Among the various neurotransmitters and enzymes assayed, only dopamine and choline acetyltransferase were present in highest concentrations in the same subdivisions of the bovine median eminence found to be rich in TRH and LHRH. The distributions of norepinephrine, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and histamine appeared to correlate poorly with the major distributions of TRH and LHRH. These findings suggest that at the level of the median eminence, central neuroendocrine regulation of TRH and LHRH release may involve an interaction only with dopamine and acetylcholine.\n",
      "The effects of neurally active amino acids on prolactin secretion. Several neurally active amino acids were injected into the third ventricle of anesthetized male rats. Two or eight mumole of GABA produced significant increases in the plasma concentrations of prolactin (PRL), indicating increased PRL release from the pituitary. Two mumole of glycine was also effective in elevating PRL levels. The intraventricular injection of the lowest dose of GABA (1.0 mumole), glutamate (0.4 or 2.3 mumole), lysine (0.2 or 2.0 mumole), or 0.9% NaCl did not alter PRL levels significantly. Plasma PRL concentrations did not increase following the injection of GABA or glycine directly into the anterior pituitary gland. The results suggest that GABA and glycine may play a role in the neural regulation of PRL secretion.\n",
      "Determination of D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in mouse pancreatic islets with a photokinetic technique using bacterial luciferase. A sensitive assay for d-3hydroxybutrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) was developed for use with the minute amounts of material obtained from islets of Langerhans microdissected from freeze-dried pancreatic sections. NADH formed in the enzyme reaction was determined by photokinetic analysis of the luminescence obtained with bacterial luciferase from Achromobacter fishcherii. In this way, accurate determination was obtained with less than 0.1 mug dry weight of islet material. In obese hyperglycemic mice, the islet enzyme had an activity of 4.7 mumoles/min and g dry weight. Optimal enzyme activity was found at pH 8 for the islet enzyme. The enzyme activity was similar in pancreatic islets and acini, while considerably higher activity was found in cardiac muscle, liver and renal cortex. Normal mouse islets showed about equal enzyme activity as the islets from obese hyperglycemic mice.\n",
      "Human platelet glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Total purification, kinetic studies and relationship with enzyme from other blood cells. Human platelet G-6-PD has been highly purified, to homogeneity, and its kinetic, electrophoretic and immunological characteristics have been studied. Platelet G-6-PD differs from erythrocyte or leukocyte enzymes by an increased Michaelis constant for G-6-P and a slow activity at the acid pHs. By electrofocusing only a main active band (band a) of platelet G-6-PD was found. The incubation at 37 degrees C in the presence of NADP+ and dithiothreitol normalize Km-G-6-P of platelet G-6-PD; the incubation with boiled and ultrafiltered leukemic granulocyte extracts led to an anodisation of G-6-PD active forms, a decrease of the molecular specific activity and a further increase of Km-G-6-P; these last modifications are the same as those undergone by G-6-PD incubated in crude extracts of normal or leukemic granulocytes.\n",
      "Clinical evaluation of blood lactate levels in equine colic. Blood lactate levels were evaluated in 36 horses (43 cases) presented with colic. A correlation between increasing blood lactate levels and decreasing percentage survival has been shown. An appreciable anion gap was found in 7 of 10 cases analyzed in detail but in each case the entire gap could not be accounted for by lactate alone. Proposals are offered to account for the unmeasured anions. Blood lactate determination is suggested as a prognostic rather than a diagnostic aid for the equine practitioner and should be used to augment other clinical findings in the horse exhibiting colic.\n",
      "Equine viral encephalitis. The most important neurotropic viral infections of the horse are the arthropod-borne encephalitides. These include Venezuelan encephalitis (VE), eastern encephalitis (EE) and western encephalitis (WE), which are found in the Americas, and Japanese B encephalitis which occurs in the Far East. All the viruses cause encephalitis in man. Between 1969 and 1972 an epidemic of VE occurred in Central America. In 1971 the disease was reported in Texas, where it was brought under control by the vaccination of susceptible horses with an attenuated live virus vaccine and by the reduction of the mosquito population with insecticides sprayed from aircraft. A high titre viraemia occurs with VE virus in the horse and epidemics are maintained by a mosquito/horse cycle; infection of man and other species is incidental. EE and WE have been recognised as separate diseases since 1933 and in the U.S.A. horses are protected by routine vaccination. Epidemics of these diseases are routine vaccination. Epidemics of these diseases are now uncommon. In contrast with VE, both EE and WE viruses are maintained by a bird/mosquito cycle. The viraemia in the horse is generally considered insufficient to infect mosquito vectors; the horse is a \"dead end host\". Several species of mosquito can act as vectors of VE, WE and EE. The extension of other arthropod-borne diseases to areas originally outside their geographical distribution (e.g. bluetongue in sheep) serves to illustrate the potential of VE, WE and EE to cause disease on other continents.\n",
      "The threonine-sensitive homoserine dehydrogenase and aspartokinase activities of Escherichia coli K-12. Incubation of the enzyme in alkaline conditions: dissociation and disulfide-bridge formation. Aspartokinase I - homoserine dehydrogenase I from Escherichia coli K-12, a homotetrameric enzyme, dissociates into dimers upon alkaline treatment. Both aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase inactivation, as well as desensitazion towards L-threonine, occur in a multi-step process. Dithiothreitol stabilizes a dimeric form retaining full activity and sensitivity; L-homoserine stabilizing another dimeric form devoid of aspartokinase activity and retaining a substantial dehydrogenase activity insensitive toward L-threonine. A model is proposed showing that dissociation into dimers occurs in a first step, the resulting dimer losing both aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase sensitivity in two subsequent steps involving the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds.\n",
      "A calorimetric study of the CO Bohr effect of monomeric haemoglobins. A calorimetric study has been made of the heats of CO reaction with the monomeric haemoglobins of Chironomus thummi thummi III and IV as a function of pH. The number of Bohr protons released at pH 7.1 was determined from heats of reaction in different buffers as 0.19 and 0.31 mol H+/mol CO for haemoglobin III and IV respectively. The heat of the Bohr ionization process was found to be 6 and 8 kcal/mol H+ (25 and 34 kJ/mol) for the haemoglobins III and IV. These values are consistent with values found for histidine groups. A pH-independent part of the reaction enthalpy was determined as - 19.7 kcal/mol CO (-82.4 kJ/mol). The same reaction with myoglobin is less exothermic. From the combination of deltaG0 and deltaH0 values TdeltaS0 values have been calculated. It was found for both haemoglobins that the entropy of reaction is greater by 2 cal K-1 mol-1 (8.4 JK-1 mol-1) at pH 9.5 as compared to pH 6.0.\n",
      "Conformational studies of two non-histone chromosomal proteins and their interactions with DNA. The conformational properties of two non-histone chromosomal proteins (high-mobility-group proteins 1 and 2) have been studied by spectroscopic methods. The interaction of high-mobility-group protein 1 with DNA has also been studied. 1. Circular dichroism results indicate that in the presence of salt both proteins are 40-50% helical between pH 1 and 9. Above pH 9 denaturation takes place. In the absence of salt the proteins denature below pH 4. 2. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra show the presence of ring-current shifted peaks and perturbed aromatic resonances, demonstrating that the helix formation is accompanied by specific tertiary folding. 3. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of compelxes between high mobility group protein 1 and DNA demonstrate that a low ionic strength a portion of the molecule rich in lysine and containing all the aromatic residues is bound to DNA, whilst a more acidic region of the chain remains free from the DNA.\n",
      "Succinylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus. A reactive threonine residue in the apoenzyme. 1. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from bacillus stearothermophilus can be extensively succinylated in the presence of substrates and coenzyme without appreciable loss of activity. 2. The apoenzyme in the absence of substrates is rapidly inhibited by small amounts of succinic anhydride. NAD+, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and inorganic phosphate all afford protection from inhibition, and inhibition is slowly reversed in the presence of pyrophosphate at pH 8.5. 3. Kinetic and spectral studies have shown that the specific inhibition is associated with the succinylation of the aliphatic hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue. 4. The residue specifically succinylated has been identified as one of the two threonine residues, most probably Thr-150, adjacent to the activ-site cysteine residue in the primary structure. Its unusual reactivity is discussed in relation to the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. 5. A second residue, a lysine homologous with Lys-212 in the pig muscle enzyme, can be succinylated in both holoenzyme and apoenzyme with no detectable effect upon the enzymic activity.\n",
      "Membrane-reversible H+-ATPase from Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Treatment of phosphorylating fragments of bacterial membrane from Micrococcus lysodeikticus with trypsin leads to increase ATPase activity. As a result of this treatment, the membrane fragments acquire the ability to transform the ATP energy into transmembrane difference in potential. Dithiothreitol has a similar effect to that of trypsin on the membrane fragments from M. lysodeikticus. Dicyclohexylcarbodimide inhibits ATPase of the membrane fragments of M. lysodeikticus, and also the ATPase-reaction-coupled generation of membrane potential. It has been suggested that the increased ATPase activity of membranes from M. lysodeikticus during treatment with trypsin and dithiothreitol is connected with the effect of these agents on the protein inhibitor of ATPase.\n",
      "Active-site-directed inhibition of the plasma-membrane carrier transporting short-chain, neutral amino acids into Trypanosoma brucei. 1. Glycine chloromethyl inhibited the active-transport of L-serine into bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei. 2. Substrates of the short-chain, neutral amino acid transport system (N1), but not of other amino acid transport systems, protected the carrier protein from inhibition. 3. Inhibition was never more than 80% complete. The residual activity might have due to a proportion of N1 carrier active sites which had not reacted with the inhibitor. 4. The inhibition was highly selective for the N1 amino acid transport system. Other amino acid transport systems were not affected and the rate of respiration was only slightly affected. 5. The inhibition was first-order with respect to concentration, indicating that one molecule of the inhibitor reacted with each carrier active-site. 6. The high selectivity of this inhibitor should make it a useful labelling agent during the isolation and purification of the N1 amino acid transport carrier protein(s).\n",
      "A quantitative model for partition in aqueous multiphase systems. A model for the partition of charged molecules in aqueous multiphase systems has been developed. The partition coefficient of one component, or the overall partition coefficient of a number of components, between two arbitrary phases is expressed in terms of the difference in electrical potential between the phases (due to electrolytes present in the system), the net charges of the partitioned components and their partition coefficients in a (sometimes hypothetical) uncharged state. The fraction of material in one phase has also been described as a function of the net charges of the partitioned components. The model fits well to experimental data for partition of chromate, pyridine, ribonuclease A, two types of CO-hemoglobin and an enzyme mixture (yeast lysate) in three-phase systems consisting of poly(ethylene glycol), dextran, Ficoll and water. Minor deviations from the model are construed to be a pH-dependent uptake of ions. The data have also been used to detect differences in solvation of similar proteins, as well as the presence of several forms of some glycolytic enzymes present in yeast lysate.\n",
      "Lysis of yeast cell walls. Lytic beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucanase from Bacillus circulans WL-12. When grown in a mineral medium with yeast cell walls or yeast glucan as the sole carbon source, Bacillus circulans WL-12 produces wall-lytic enzymes in addition to non-lytic beta-(1 leads to 3) and beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucananases. The lytic enzymes were isolated from the culture liquid by adsorption on insoluble yeast glucan in batch operation. After digestion of the glucan, the mixture of enzymes was chromatographed on hydroxylapatite on which the lytic activity could be resolved into one lytic beta-(1 leads to 6)glucanase and two lytic beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanase was further purified by chromatography over diethylamino-ehtyl-agarose and carboxymethyl cellulose. Its specific activity on pustulan was 6.2 units per mg of protein. The enzyme moved as a single protein with a molecular weight of 54000 during sodium dodecylsulphate electrophoresis in slab gels. Hydrolysis of pustulan went thorugh a series of oligosaccharides, leading to a mixture of gentiotriose, gentiobiose and glucose. The enzyme also produced small amounts of gentiobiose from laminarin and pachyman and on this basis its lytic activity on yeast cell walls,was attribut beta-(1 leads to 3)-linked oligosaccharides were not detected. The lytic beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucanase has an optimum pH of 6.0. Pustulan hydrolysis followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A Km of 0.29 mg pustulan per ml and a V of 9.1 micro-equivalents of glucose released/min per mg of enzyme were calculated. The enzyme has no metal ion requirement. The lytic beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucanase differs in essence from the non-lytic beta-(1 leads to 6)-glucanase of the same organism by its positive action on yeast cell walls and yeast glucan and its much lower specific activity on soluble pustulan.\n",
      "Lysis of yeast cell walls. Lytic beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanases from Bacillus circulans WL-12. Bacillus circulans WL-12 when grown in a mineral medium with yeast cell walls or yeast glucan as the soli carbon source, produced five beta-glucanases. Two beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanases (I and II), which are lytic to yeast cell walls, were isolated from the culture liquid by batch adsorption on yeast glucan, and separated by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. Lytic beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanase I was further purified by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. The specific activity of lytic beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucanase I on laminarin was 4.1 U per mg of protein. The enzyme moved as a single protein with a molecular weight of 40000 during sodium dodecylsulfate electrophoresis in slab gels. It was specific for the beta-(1 leads to 3)-glucosidic bond but the enzyme did not hydrolyze laminaribiose. Hydrolysis of laminarin went through a series of oligosaccharides, and laminaribiose and glucose accumulated till the end of the reaction. A small amount of gentibiose was also produced from laminarin. Products from yeast cell walls and yeast glucan included laminaripentaose, laminaritriose, laminaribiose, glucose and gentiobiose, but no laminaritetraose was detected. This glucanase has an optimum pH of 5.5.\n",
      "Algal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Pyridine-nucleotide requirements of two enzymes purified from Scenedesmus obliquus. Two enzymes with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity have been purified from heterotrophically grown Scenedesmus obliquus by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The D-enzyme has a molecular weight of 550000 and a VNADH: VNADPH ratio of 16 whereas the T-enzyme has a molecular weight of 140000 and a VNADH:VNADPH ratio of 0.15. The two enzymes, however, are very similar with regard to their Michaelis constants for the reduced pyridine nucleotides, pH optimum, subunit size and ultraviolet absorption.\n",
      "Multiple forms of cyclohexanone oxygenase from Nocardia globerula CL1. The cyclohexanone 1,2-monooxygenase of Nocardia globerula CL1 exists as two electrophoretically distinct forms. These are present in crude cell extracts and are not artifacts of enzyme purification or electrophoresis. They have been separated in mg amounts by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and shown to have essentially identical kinetic, spectral and physical characteristics. They do differ in pH-activity profile and temperature stability. Whether or not they are conformational isoenzymes or arise by gene duplication and divergent evolution has not been established. Cyclohexanone oxygenase constitutes 8% of the soluble protein of induced cells. This high level would correlate well with the presence of duplicate genes. It is proposed that the presence of a large amount of cyclohexanone oxygenase may confer an ecological advantage on the organism.\n",
      "Purification and properties of cyclopentanone oxygenase of Pseudomonas NCIB 9872. 1. Cyclopentanone oxygenase from Pseudomonas NCIB 9872 has been purified some 40-fold. It gives a single peak in the ultracentrifuge and a single major protein band on polyacrylamide gels contaminated with about 5% of a slower migrating impurity. Flavin dissociates from the protein during electrophoresis. 2. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 200000 and is a homopolymeric assemblage of either three of four subunits of molecular weight 54000-58000. 3. The prosthetic group is FAD and values of about 2.5 are typically obtained for the number of moles bound to each mole of holoenzyme. Some FAD probably dissociates during purification and it seems likely that each subunit binds one FAD in the undamaged protein.\n",
      "Purification and properties of a methanol-oxidizing enzyme in Pseudomonas C. A methanol-oxidizing enzyme has been purified from Pseudomonas C, grown on methanol as a sole source for carbon and energy. The purification procedure involved ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration and resulted in a yield of 35.4%. Enzyme activity can be coupled to phenazine methosulfate and requires the presence of ammonium ions in the assay mixtures. The enzymes possesses a broad specificity for primary alcohols. Formaldehyde is also oxidized by the purified enzyme. The Km value for methanol is 15 muM. The optimum pH for the oxidation of both methanol and formaldehyde is about 10.4. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 128000 and consists of two subunits each having a molecular weight of 60000.\n",
      "Temperature-dependent change in rate-limiting step of the magnesium-stimulated ITPase of myosin. The effects of temperature on Mg-ITPase activity of heavy meromyosin and myosin subfragment 1 were measured in 0.1 M KC1. The initial burst of Pi liberation was one mol per mol of heavy meromyosin or two mol of myosin subfragment 1, i.e. one mol per two mol of myosin active sites, at 20 degrees C. However, it was almost zero mol below 8degrees C. Effects of KC1 concentration and pH on ITPase activity of heavy meromyosin at 20 degrees C were different from those below 8 degrees C, suggesting that the rate-limiting step in the Mg-ITP hydrolysis of myosin depends on temperature. The effect of temperature on the actin activation of heavy meromyosin Mg-ITPase was analyzed by measuring the temperature dependence of double-reciprocal plots of ITPase activity against actin concentration. The extent of actin activation was larger at low temperture. The results presented in this paper might be explained by assuming the existence of two kinds of active sites on a myosin molecule.\n",
      "Nuclear-magnetic-resonance study of the active-site structure of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase. The enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate kinase from yeast has been studied by observation of the proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum at 270 MHz using Fourier transform techniques. Difference spectroscopy was used to enhance the resolution and to identify specific ligand binding effects and conformational changes. Perturbations involving single protons of amino-acid residues could thus be detected despite the relatively high molecular weight of the protein (47000), particularly in the aromatic (6-9 ppm) and methylene (2-3 ppm) regions of the spectrum.\n",
      "Fluroescence of proteins in 6-M guanidine hydrochloride. A method for the quantitative determination of tryptophan. To determine the tryptophan content in proteins,an analytical ultraviolet fluroescence method is proposed based on making uniform the environment of aromatic chromophores in 6-7 M guanidine hydrochloride. The fluorescence intensity scale is calibrated using standard solutions of free tryptophan. A correlation coefficient between the fluorescence of protein tryptophanyl residues and of free tryptophan was estimated in testing 17 well characterized proteins. This method is particularly suited to proteins carrying groups absorbing in the 290-370 nm region, such as flavin, heme and pyridoxal phosphate and in the presence of substances such as 2-mercaptoethanol which prohibit the use of the spectroscopic or magnetic circular dichroism methods. It is less time-consuming than techniques requiring hydrolysis or chemical reactions.\n",
      "An extracellular aminopeptidase from Clostridium histolyticum. An aminopeptidase was isolated from the culture filtrate of Clostridium histolyticum and purified to homogeneity. Absence of endopeptidase activity in the purified preparation was demonstrated. Gel filtration on a calibrated column indicates an apparent molecular weight of 340000 for the native enzyme. Gel electrophoresis of the denatured enzyme in the presence of dodecylsulfate in constant acrylamide concentration and in a concentration gradient, resulted in the appearance of a single component for which a molecular weight of 51000 and 59000 respectively, was calculated. From mobilities of crosslinked and denatured protein species a molecular weight of 56000 was obtained for the monomer. Specificity studies show that the enzyme cleaves all types of N-terminel amino acid residues including proline and hydroxyproline from small peptides and from polypeptides. The peptide bond formed between an N-terminal amino acid residue and proline is not cleaved by the enzyme. The combined action of aminopeptidase-P and clostridal aminopeptidase leads to complete hydrolysis of the proline-rich nonapeptide bradykinin. Low rates of hydrolysis was observed for charged residues, and amides of amino acids. Kinetic studies with five tripeptides of the general structure X-Gly-Gly, where X stands for Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, or Pro, show a decrease in Km with the increasing size of the hydrophobic side chain of X. The highest Kcat values are observed with proline and alanine. In the series Pro-Gly, Pro-Gly-Pro, Pro-Gly-Pro-Pro, the last peptide is the best substrate, indicating an active site complementary to at least four amino acid residues. The enzymatic activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, maximal activation being reached with Mn2+ and Co2+. The optimal pH for the Mn2+ and Co2+- activated enzyme is 8.6 and 8.2 respectively. The optimal temperature is 40 degrees C. Inhibition of the aminopeptidase was achieved with Zn2+, Cu2+ and p-mercuribenzoate, but not with diisopropylphosphofluoridate.\n",
      "Ornithine carbamoyltransferase from Escherichia coli W. Purification, structure and steady-state kinetic analysis. Ornithine carbamoyltransferase from Escherichia coli W was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 105000. It is composed of three apparently identical subunits with molecular weights of 35000. The mechanism of the ornithine carbamoyltransferase enzyme system from E. coli W was investigated kinetically by using the approach of product inhibition and dead-end inhibition of both forward and reverse reactions. On the basis of the kinetic data and binding studies it appears that the mechanism of the reaction involves a compulsory sequence of substrate binding to the enzyme, in which carbamoylphosphate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme and phosphate the last product to be released. The same studies also indicate that the mechanism involves dead-end complexes. The reaction mechanism appears consistent with that proposed by Theorell and Chance. Values have been determined for the Michaelis and dissociation constants involved in the combination of each reactant with the enzyme. Comparison of the values for the kinetic constants which are common to both forward and reverse reaction have shown that they are always of a comparable magnitude.\n",
      "Reactivity of the sulfhydryl groups of soluble succinate dehydrogenase. Soluble succinate dehydrogenase prepared by butanol extraction reacts with N-ethylmaleimide according to first-order kinetics with respect to both remaining active enzyme and the inhibitor concentration. Binding of the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme prevents its alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide and inhibition by oxaloacetate. A kinetic analysis of the inactivation of alkylating reagent in the presence of succinate or malonate suggests that N-ethylmaleimide acts as a site-directed inhibitor. The apparent first-order rate constant of alkylation increases between pH 5.8 and 7.8 indicating a pKa value for the enzyme sulfhydryl group equal to 7.0 at 22 degrees C in 50 mM Tris-sufate buffer. Certain anions (phosphate, citrate, maleate and acetate) decrease the reactivity of the enzyme towards the alkylating reagent. Succinate/phenazine methosulfate reductase activity measured in the presence of a saturating concentration of succinate shows the same pH-dependence as the alkylation rate by N-ethylmaleimide. The mechanism of the first step of succinate oxidation, including a nucleophilic attack of substrate by the active-site sulfhydryl group, is discussed.\n",
      "Identification and properties of 8-hydroxyflavin--adenine dinucleotide in electron-transferring flavoprotein from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. 1. A new flavin prosthetic group has been isolated in pure form from the electron-transferring flavoprotein of Peptostreptococcus elsdenni. Its structure has been established as the FAD derivative of 7-methyl-8-hydroxyisoalloxazine: (see article). Proof of this structure has been obtained by chemical syntehsis of 7-methyl-8-hydroxyisoalloxazine models, and by stepwise degradation of the native compound to 7-methy-8-hydroxyalloxazine. The orange chromophore is characterized by a strong absorption band with a maximum at 472 nm (xi = 41 000 M-1 CM-1) and a pK at 4.8 due to the ionisation of the C(8)-OH group. 2. The properties of a series of functionally substituted derivatives of 8-hydroxy flavins and lumichromes have been investigated to provide a basis for interpreting the effects of pH on the spectroscopic properties of the 8-hydroxy derivatives of FAD and FMN. 3. The 8-hydroxy derivative of FAD is bound by apo-D-amino acid oxidase; the complex shows no catalytic activity. The 8-hydroxy derivative of FMN is bound by apoflavodoxin to give a complex which has catalytic activity similar to that of native flavodoxin. The complex is reversibly reduced by dithionite, first to a relatively stable semiquinone and further to the dihydroflavin form.\n",
      "Kinetics of reassociation and reactivation of pig-muscle lactic dehydrogenase after acid dissociation. Lactic dehydrogenase from pig skeletal muscle (M4) can be reversibly dissociated to the monomer at pH 4-5 depending on the anion applied. Using identical experimental conditions the pH-depending profiles of dissociation, denaturation, and deactivation coincide with each other. Deviations in the pH-dependence of protein fluorescence reflect changes in the microenvironment of specific chromophores rather than significant differences in the structure-function relationship as pH is changed. The dissociation state is characterized by the homogeneous inactive monomer of 35000. The reassociated material consists of up to 85% fully active tetramers, indistinguishable from the initial native enzymes, as shown by hydrodynamic, spectroscopic and enzymic properties. The rest represents a mixture of irreversibly denatured high aggregates. Under optimum conditions of reactivation both recovery of enzymic activity and native fluorescence obey strict second order kinetics with an activation energy of 44 kcal/mol (184 kJ/mol). NAD+ and NADH do not show any significant influence on the yield and kinetics of the refolding process and the recovery of enzymic activity. The kinetic results suggest the reassociation of inactive monomers to be rate-limiting in the refolding and reactivation processes being considered.\n",
      "Alkylation of estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase from human placenta with 3-chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide. 3-Chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide, which is active as a hydride acceptor (Km = 0.6 mM), inactivates and alkylates estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase. The kinetics of inactivation by 3-chloroacetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide and the absence of inactivation by 3-chloroacetylpyridine ribose phosphate show that the alkylation follows the formation of a binary complex (Kd = 4.5 X 10(-4) M). Studies of the labelling by 3-chloro[2-14C]acetylpyridine--adenine dinucleotide and the rate of alkylation as a function of pH, give evidence to the alkylation of a cysteine, the stoichiometry being one mole per subunit. The 14C label is distributed between three chymotryptic peptides, one of which accounts for about 50% of the radioactive label.\n",
      "Regulation of respiration and nitrogen fixation in different types of Azotobacter vinelandii. The levels of the adenine nucleotides, pyridine nucleotides and the kinetical parameters of the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) were determined in Azotobacter vinelandii cells, grown under O2- or N2-limiting conditions. It was concluced that the levels of both the adenine nucleotides and pyridine nucleotides do not limit the rate of sucrose oxidation. Experiments with radioactive pyruvate and sucrose show that the rate of sucrose oxidation of Azotobacter cells is associated with an increase in the rate of sucrose uptake. The sites of oxidative phosphorylation and the composition of the respiratory membranes with respect to cytochromes c4 + c5, b and d differ in cells growth either O2- or N2-limited. It was possible to show that the respiration protection of the nitrogen-fixing system in Azotobacter is mainly independent of the oxidation capacity of the cells. The oxidation capacity intrinsically depends on the type of substrate and can be partly adapted. The maximum activity of the nitrogenase in Azotobacter depends on the type of substrate oxidized. Although the level of energy charge is somewhat dependent on the type of substrate used, no obvious relation can be derived between changes in energy charge and nitrogenase activity. An alternative proposal is given.\n",
      "The proton electrochemical gradient in Escherichia coli cells. The internal pH of Escherichia coli cells was estimated from the distribution of either 5,5-[14C]dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione or [14C]methylamine. EDTA/valinomycin treatment of cells was employed to estimate delta psi from 86Rb+ distribution concomitant with the delta pH for calculation of delta muH. Respiring intact cells maintained an internal pH more alkaline by 0.63-0.75 unit than that of the milieu at extracellular pH 7, both in growth medium and KCl solutions. The delta pH decreased when respiration was inhibited by anaerobiosis or in the presence of KCN. The delta muH, established by EDTA/valinomycin-treated cells, was constant (122-129 mV) over extracellular potassium concentration of 0.01 mM-1 mM. At the lower potassium concentration delta psi (110-120 mV) was the predominant component, and at the higher concentration delta pH increased to 0.7 units (42 mV). At 150 mM potassium delta muH was reduced to 70 mV mostly due to a delta pH component of 0.89 (53 mV). The interchangeability of the delta muH components is consistent with an electronic proton pump and with potassium serving as a counter ion in the presence of valinomycin. Indeed both parameters of delta muH decreased in the presence of carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. The highest delta pH of 2 units was observed in the intact cells at pH 6; increasing the extracellular pH decreased the delta pH to 0 at pH 7.65 and to -0.51 at pH 9. A similar pattern of dependence of delta pH on extracellular pH was observed in EDTA/valinomycin-treated cells but the delta psi was almost constant over the whole range of extracellular pH values (6-8) implying electroneutral proton movement. Potassium is specifically required for respiration of EDTA-treated E. coli K12 cells since other monovalent or divalent cations could not replace potassium and valinomycin was not required.\n",
      "[Spectral properties of porcine plasminogen: study of the acidic transition (author's transl)]. The acidic transition of porcine plasminogen, prepared by affinity chromatography, was studied by non-destructive methods. These methods are based on the analysis of the behaviour of the tryptophyls under various conditions. The perturbation of the absorption and emission spectra by pH or temperature and the dynamic quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence are used to obtain information on structural changes which affect the environment of these residues. It is shown that by decreasing pH the fluorescence emission spectra are shifted toward the long wavelengths, with a broadening of the fluorescence band. The same effect can be obtained at constant pH by heating the protein solution. In order to analyze these phenomena, it is assumed that the fluorescence intensities at 355 nm and 328 nm reflect the proportion of the tryptophans which are exposed to the solvent, and buried, respectively. The plot of the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at these wavelengths versus pH or temperature leads to a titration curve showing an unmasking of tryptophans. The proportion of exposed tryptophans is measured by the dynamic fluorescence quenching technique and the data analyzed according to Lehrer. The plot of the fraction of exposed tryptophyls versus pH also shows the unmasking of these chromophores. Thermal perturbation of a solution of plaminogen at neutral pH induces a difference absorption spectrum whose amplitudes at the maxima are proportional to the number of exposed aromatic residues. The comparison with a solution of fully denatured plasminogen in 6 M guanidium chloride, where all the tryptophyls are exposed, shows that the percentage of exposure is equal to 59%. This number is significantly higher than the percentage found by the fluorescence quenching technique (20%), indicating that some tryptophyls are located in crevices, exposed to the solvent but not to the iodide. At acidic pH the absorption difference spectra induced by thermal perturbation are not classical, since they show an inversion and a new band between 300 nm and 305 nm. This band is mentioned in the literature as a minor band of tryptophan which appears when this chromophore is located in an asymmetric environment. On plotting the maximum amplitude of these spectra obtained at acidic pH versus temperature, we obtain a curve indicating that two types of antagonistic interactions are involved in the perturbation of the chromophores spectra. The spectrophotometric titration of plasminogen gives classical absorption difference spectra. By plotting the maximum amplitude at 292 nm versus pH, we obtain a titration curve with an apparent pK of 2.9 units. This pK is acidic which respect to the pK value of a normal carboxyl. This low value can be due to a positively charged group in the neighbourhood of a carboxyl, which interacts with one or more chromophores. When the carboxyl becomes protonated, this positively charged group is free and available to perturb the environment of some chromophores...\n",
      "Comparison of the metal-ion-promoted dephosphorylation of the 5'-triphosphates of adenosine, inosine, guanosine and cytidine by Mn2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ in binary and ternary complexes. The dependence of the rate of dephosphorylation of ATP, ITP, GTP and CTP (= NTP), expressed as first-order rate constants (50 degrees C; I = 0.1 M, NaClO4), on pH (2 to 10), in the absence and presence of Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+, was investigated. The reaction is accelerated by Zn2+ and passes through a pH optimum at about 8 for the system Zn2+-ATP or 9 for Zn2+-ITP and Zn2+-GTP; this is analogous to observations made earlier with the corresponding Cu2+ systems. By computing the pH dependence of the distribution of the several species present in these systems it is shown that the highest rates are observed in the pH regions where the concentration of Zn(ATP)2-, Zn(ITP-H)3-, or Zn(GTP-H)3- dominates. By evaluating the pH dependence evidence is given that the attacking nucleophile is OH- or H2O for Zn (ATP)2- and H2O for Zn (ITP-H)3- or Zn(GTP-H)3-. For all these complexes metal-ion/nucleic-base interactions are known, leading to the formation of macrochelates. These metal-ion/nucleic-base interactions are crucial for the observation of a metal-ion-promoted dephosphorylation; in agreement with this, and the small tendency of the cytosine moiety to coordinate, the CTP systems are rather stable towards dephosphorylation. It should be noted that these experimental results do not necessarily mean that the macrochelates usually described are the reactive complexes, but only that the active complex must be closely related to them (e.g. isomers, etc). Although for the Ni2+ systems with ATP, ITP, and GTP, and for the Mn2+-ATP system a metal-ion/nucleic-base interaction is also known, these systems are not very sensitive to hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal P-O-P bond. The only known significant structural difference between the Ni2+-NTP or the Mn2+-ATP complexes and those of Cu2+ or Zn2+ is that Ni2+ Mn2+ coordinate to all three phsophate groups, whereas Cu2+ and Zn2+ involve only the beta and gamma ones. This structure-reactivity relationship is rationalized by the suggestion that in the active species the metal ion should be coordinated to the alpha,beta-phosphate groups leaving the gamma-group open to nucleophilic attack. Obviously, an initial beta,gamma-coordination is suitable for a shift of the metal ion along the phosphate back-bone into the reactive alpha-beta-position, while for an alpha,beta,gamma-coordination only the less favorable removal of the coordinated gamma-group remains. The metal-ion/nucleic-base interaction is considered as being important for achieving this reactive structure. The connection between trans-phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo is discussed. It is also shown that the formation of mixed-ligand or ternary complexes inhibits the dephosphorylation process. This is on the one hand of interest with regard to the transport of hydrolysis-sensitive phosphates in nature, while on the other it casts doubts on conclusions based on experiments carried out in the presence of buffers, because these contain weak bases and hence potential ligands.\n",
      "Rat-liver superoxide dismutase. Purification and age-related modifications. Cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase has been purified from livers of young (6 months) and old (27 months) rats. The enzyme purified from old animals shows an age-related reduction in the specific activity, accumulation of antigenically cross-reacting material and increased sensitivity to temperature. No differences were found in the molecular weight, electrophoretic mobility, antigenicity and Ki between enzymes purified from young and old rats. This is the first demonstration of age-related alterations in a purified form of a non-metabolic enzyme, which can be related to reduced activity. The possible role of this reduced activity in age-dependent deterioration of cellular functions is discussed.\n",
      "Effects of ouabain and hypoxia on the cardiac stimulation threshold in the dog (with special reference to changes in extra- and intracellular potassium concentrations). The influence on the cardiac stimulation threshold of changes in the myocardial intra/extracellular potassium ratio induced with ouabain and hypoxia was investigated in 9 dogs with total atrioventricular block. In spite of significant elevations of extracellular potassium and reductions of intracellular potassium significant changes in stimulation threshold were not seen. It is suggested that different experimental conditions are responsible for the great variations in the results of previous studies of this subject.\n",
      "The effect of fructose infusions on the oxygen transport system of human blood. In 9 healthy subjects the erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration, which modifies the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin, decreased by more than 25 per cent within 60 minutes of the beginning of a fructose infusion (0.5 g.kg body weight-1.h-1). In contrast erythrocyte adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration was unchanged. In spite of the diminished 2,3-DPG concentrations the oxygen affinity of whole blood actually measured remained unaltered. However, at the same time both the arterial and the venous blood pH had fallen by 0.05 or more. In vitro experiments indicated that this fall of erythrocyte 2,3-DPG was not due to a direct effect of fructose on the intra-erythrocytic regulation of 2,3-DPG or to changes indirectly related to the intravenous administration of fructose in vivo, i.e. an increase of the blood lactate/pyruvate ratio or a decrease of plasma inorganic phosphate. It is suggested that two opposing effects on the oxygen transport system of blood are induced by fructose infusions: 1) a displacement of the oxygen dissociation curve to the right due to the Bohr effect 2) a virtually counterbalancing shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the left due to decreased erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentrations.\n",
      "A comparison between a melanocyte-stimulating hormone inhibitory factor (MIF-I) and substances known to activate central dopamine receptors. The tripeptide, prolyl-leucyl glycine amide, a melanocyte-stimulating hormone inhibitory factor (MIF-I), which has been reported to be effective in improving symptoms of Parkinson's disease, has been compared with drugs known to activate dopamine receptors in rat and mouse brain. Unlike apomorphine, amphetamine and amantadine it was incapable of producing sterotyped behaviour in the rat and unlike 1-dopa it was also ineffective in rats pretreated with the monoamineoxidase inhibitor mebanazine. Neither did it potentiate apomorphine nor amphetamine in this test. MIF-I did not antagonise chlorpromazine-induced loss of locomotor activity in mice, an effect which was antagonised by apomorphine, amphetamine and amantadine. Chlorpromazine hypothermia in the mouse was antagonised by 1-dopa but not by MIF-I; similar findings were obtained in reserpine-pretreated mice. These results suggest that the reported beneficial effect of MIF-I in Parkinson's disease is unlikely to be due to an interaction with dopamine systems in the brain.\n",
      "Acute graft-versus-host reaction in mice. 3. Organ distribution of injected 51 chromium labeled lymphocytes. The distribution of labeled lymph node cells, causing an acute GvH reaction in lethally irradiated allogeneic recipients, was studied. Lymph node cells of C57BL mice were labeled with 51Cr and injected into lethally irradiated: a) C57BL mice, b) CBA mice, c) CBA mice sensitized to C57BL antigens prior to irradiation, d) CBA mice splenectomized before irradiation. Two more experimental situations were studied in which C57BL donors of lymph node cells were: e) presensitized to CBA antigens, or f) deprived of T-lymphocytes. The amount of radioactivity was determined in the whole body, blood, liver, spleen, subcutaneous lymph nodes, lungs, femora and kidneys of the irradiated recipient at regular intervals from the time of injection to the 120th hour after it. We found that living cells lodged predominantly in the spleen and the lymph nodes, while dead and dying cells accumulated in the liver. Other organs contained very small amounts of radioactivity. All the results point to the primary role of the spleen in the acute graft-versus-host reaction.\n",
      "Mitigation of graft-versus-host disease in mice by treatment of donors with bacterial endotoxin. Treatment of DBA/2 (H-2d) mice with bacterial endotoxin prior to transplantation of their spleen and lymph node cells into immunosuppressed AKR (H-2k) mice prevented acute mortality from graft-versus-host (GVH) disease. AKR mice that received immunocompetent cells from untreated DBA/2 mice had a median survival time (MST) of 13 days. In contrast, AKR mice that received immunocompetent cells from endotoxin-treated DBA/2 donors had an MST of 54 days. Endotoxin treatment of AKR recipients was not essential for preventing mortality from acute GVH disease. Chimerism was proved by demonstrating that the lymphoid cells of long-term surviving AKR mice had the characteristics of DBA/2 lymphoid cells as measured by their response in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) tests. Spleen cells from endotoxin-treated DBA/2 mice were able to stimulate, and to be stimulated by, AKR spleen cells in MLC assays. Furthermore, spleen cells from endotoxin-treated DBA/2 mice did not suppress the responses of DBA/2 or AKR spleen cells in 'three-party' MLC tests.\n",
      "Influence of diurnal cycles on biochemical parameters of drug sensitivity: the pineal gland as a model. Diurnal cycles in physical parameters in the environment modulate biochemical and physiological circadian rhythms in experimental animals, including cycles in the sensitivity to external influences. Environmental lighting synchronizes cycles of indole metabolism and melatonin synthesis in the rat pineal gland by modulating the activity of postganglionic sympathetic nerves. As a consequence, the sensitivity of pineal N-acetyltransferase to stimulation by isoproterenol or by dibutyryl cyclic AMP varies diurnally. Also, the capacity of actinomycin D to inhibit this induction varies with circadian periodicity. The cycles in sensitivity to isoproterenol reflect cycles in the system that regulates cyclic AMP production, and include variation in the availability of specific B-adrenergic binding sites, and in the sensitivity of receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase to catecholamines. Further, a variation in the response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP indicates in addition the participation of intracellular controls in the regulation of the sensitivity of N-acetyltransferase to catecholamines. The varying sensitivity to actinomycin D suggests a changing requirement for the synthesis of RNA as a function of prior environmental lighting conditions. The basic nature of these sensitivity changes suggests that diurnal cycles of environmental lighting may similarly affect other systems.\n",
      "Nitrite, nitrosamines, and cancer. Carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds are formed from the reaction of naturally-occurring amines and nitrites that may be added to foods or produced by bacterial reduction of nitrate. N-Nitroso compounds can be produced during processing, storage and preparation of foods and in the mammalian stomach. Factors that influence the rates of nitrosation reactions include pH, temperature, catalysts, and inhibitors. Predictions of the extent of nitrosation are complicated by these factors and ultimately the amounts and types of N-nitroso compounds present must be determined by direct analysis. Methods for detection and estimation of volatile nitrosamines are available and low levels (parts per billion) have been found in some cured meat and fish products. General methods for detection of all N-nitroso compounds are not available yet, but are under development. Evaluation of the risk to human populations from these compounds is difficult in the absence of more comprehensive data on their environmental distribution.\n",
      "Hypothalamic inactivation of thyrotrophin-releasing hormone. Following the demonstration of peptidases in the rat hypothalamus which inactivate thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH), a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for the releasing hormone was used to investigate the presence of similar peptidases in the rabbit hypothalamus. TRH was found to be rapidly inactivated by supernatant and particulate hypothalamic fractions, with higher peptidase activity in the supernatant than in the particulate fraction. An optimum pH of 7.3 within physiological limits was obtained for the enzymes in both the fractions examined. The results obtained confirm that the rabbit hypothalamus contains enzymes capable of inactivating TRH, and since it has been found that such peptidases interfere with studies on TRH biosynthesis, it is possible that the peptidases may play a part in controlling the releasing hormone's production. The specificity of the antiserum used in the radioimmunoassay has also suggested that the peptidases may cleave the C-terminal-ProNH2,-NH2 or both from the TRH molecule to cause inactivation.\n",
      "Effect of cimetidine on 24-hour intragastric acidity in normal subjects. The effect of H2-receptor blockade on intragastric acidity was studied in nine normal males. The pH of their gastric contents was measured at hourly daytime and two hourly nighttime intervals for 48 hours. The subjects ate identical meals, drank identical volumes of fluid, and smoked the same number of cigarettes during the two study days. Their physical activity was unrestricted in a ward environment. Blood cimetidine and plasma gastrin were measured in serial blood samples. The nine subjects were treated in random sequence with cimetidine 0-8-1-0 g on one day and placebo capsules on the other. The drug was given in four divided doses: four subjects received it before, and five after, the three main meals. All took the fourth dose at bedtime. Replicate studies in an additional subject given placebo on both study days showed good reproducibility (r=0-80, P less than 0-01). Cimetidine therapy decreased intragastric acidity in all nine subjects. The decrease was similar in the two groups taking the drug before or after meals, mean 24 h intragastric hydrogen ion activity being lowered by 70 and 72% respectively. Nocturnal anacidity was recorded in only two of 45 samples. Administration of cimetidine before meals produced earlier and higher drug blood levels than post-prandial medication, but when it was taken after food the blood levels were highest at the time when the buffer capacity of the food was waning. Blood concentrations of cimetidine exceeded the secretory IC50 level for most of the time between doses. The results show that cimetidine 0-8-1-0 g/day in four divided doses produces a striking and consistent decrease of intragastric acidity. Although variation in the timing of the dose in relation to meals did not affect the decrease of acidity, the absorption data suggest that patients should take the drug after meals.\n",
      "The effects of some factors on the growth and morphology of Naegleria sp. and three strains of the genus Acanthamoeba. The effects of various biophysical and chemical factors on the cytology of vegetative stages of Naegleria sp., Vitek strain, Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, Acanthamoeba castellanii, Neff strain and Acanthamoeba polyphaga, No. 1289, were studied. The amoebae were cultured in a liquid medium under axenic conditions. The optimum temperature was 37 degrees C for pathogenic strains of Naegleria sp. and Acanthamoeba culbertsoni and 20 degrees C for A. castellanii. No changes were observed in the growth of A. polyphaga at the temperatures 20 degrees and 37 degrees C. The strains investigated grew at pH values of 5.6 to 7.7 using Soerensen's buffer. At the limit values the growth was inhibited and the morphology of cells was markedly changed. All of the four strains grew still at pH 8.4 kept by NaHCO3. A. polyphaga grew at partial anaerobiosis. The three tested strains of the genus Acanthamoeba grew in liquid axenic medium with 0.89% NaCl. The growth of Naegleria sp., Vitek was inhibited already at 0.2% concentration of this salt. The addition of 3 X 10(-2) m KCl to the culture medium had a harmful effect on the growth and morphology of three tested strains, except A. polyphaga. In the culture medium containing 2 X 10(-3) m CaCl2 the encystment of both pathogenic strains was stimulated. The cytological changes under experimental conditions were manifested by atypical movement of trophozoits and their intracellular structure.\n",
      "[Potassium substitutes during tocolysis]. The level of serum potassium during tokolytic therapy with Partusisten and Isoptin decreases in the first 24 hours of therapy. This decrease is not due to an increase in renal potassium elimination. During tokolytic treatment the serum level of potassium returns to its normal value after 48 hours without potassium substitution. While there is a decrease in serum potassium noticeable changes in electrocardiogram which are typial for hypopotassemia are observed. These changes disappear afer 48 hours of tokolytic treatment but never the less the initial serum potassium drop should be balanced by potassium substitution within these 48 hours.\n",
      "[Ambulatory therapy of trichomoniasis vaginalis. Clinical trial of a new Trichomonas-active azide substance]. Report on the results of the clinical trial of a new trichomonacide in ambulatory patients in a gynaecological practice. A report is given on a new drug for the treatment of vaginal trichomoniasis, which has been tried in 87 patients of a gynaecological practice under outpatient conditions. The rate of failures was 5.7% (5 of 87 cases). The advantages over alternative preparations is to be seen in the short duration of treatment (24 hours at the most), and in the favourable tolerance in spite of high doses.\n",
      "Purification and properties of Klebsiella pneumoniae heat-stable enterotoxin. The enterotoxic material in cell-free growth preparations of Klebsiella pneumoniae serotype 5 was purified by sequential ultrafiltration and gel filtration (GF) procedures and the fractions were assayed for enterotoxic activity by determining their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum. Whole-cell lysates were inactive. Anaerobic broth culture conditions yielded a 10-fold increase in toxin production over aerobic conditions. Enterotoxic activity was absent in the UM-10 retentate of the broth filtrate but present in both the retentate and filtrate of the UM-2 membrane. GF of the two UM-2 ultrafiltration fractions through a Sephadex G-25 column yielded an active eluate, whose potency was increased by 10- or 200-fold, in or adjacent to the void volume. When subsequently passed through a G-50 column, these pools eluted at a Kav of between 0.4 and 0.6 and were further increased in potency by two- or fivefold. A second equally potent fraction was also recovered in the void volume of the G-50 eluate of the UM-2 filtrate; this may represent a polymer. Progressive purification by GF was associated with an increased protein and decreased carbohydrate content of the most active fractions. The most active G-50 eluate of the UM-2 retentate had a minimal effective enterotoxic dose of 5 mug/ml and that of the filtrate was less than 0.1 mug/ml. Heating the active GF eluates to 100 C for 30 min did not abolish enterotoxic activity and lowering the pH to 1 or incubation with either Pronase or trypsin had no effect on activity. These observations indicate that K. pneumoniae heat-stable enterotoxin is probably a single toxin with an apparent molecular weight in the range of 5,000. The elution characteristics during GF as well as the chemical composition of the most purified enterotoxin fractions indicate that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin.\n",
      "Activity of two Streptococcus mutans bacteriocins in the presence of saliva, levan, and dextran. The extracellular dextrans produced from sucrose by Streptococcus mutans strains BHT and GS-5 did not prevent the synthesis or release of active bacteriocins by these two strains. In addition, several streptococci that were genetically sensitive to these bacteriocins, and that could synthesize a variety of extracellular dextrans and levans from sucrose, remained phenotypically sensitive when grown in the presence of sucrose. Bacteriocin activity was not altered by treatment with high-molecular-weight dextran or by human saliva. The bacteriocins produced by, and active against, S. mutans thus appear to be capable of acting in vivo and may play a role in regulating the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.\n",
      "Cephacetrile, a new cephalosporin: in vitro, pharmacological and clinical evaluation. Cephacetrile, a parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity, clinical pharmacology and effectiveness in the treatment of severe infections. The antibacterial activity against 187 isolates was determined by an agar-dilution technique. The MICs were 0.06 to 0.5 mug/ml for Group A Streptococcus, D. pneumoniae, and Staph. aureus, 4-6 mug/ml for E. coli and Klebsiella-Enterobacter 8-32 mug/ml for Pr. mirabilis and more than 500 mug/ml for Ps. aeruginosa. A few strains of Klebsiella and E. coli had MICs of more than 125 mcg/ml. Serum levels after 0.5 and 1 g of i.m. cephacetrile were respectively 14.6 and 18.6 mug/ml after 1 hr, and 1.5 and 2.5 mug/ml after 6 hr. Serum levels after i.v. infusion of 0.5 and 1 g were respectively 16 and 25 mug/ml after 1 hr., and 1 and 2 mug/ml after 6 hr. Urine levels after 0.5 and 1 g i.m. cephacetrile were respectively 500 and 650 mug/ml in the 0-3 hr period, and 250 and 300 mug/ml in the 3-6 hr period. Renal clearance was 166 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m2; renal excretion was about 20% of the dose 6 hr after i.m. injection. Cephacetrile was well tolerated when administered i.m. with lidocaine. Mild phlebitis occurred sometimes after i.v. infusions. The clinical response, evaluated in 36 patients with severe systemic, respiratory and urinary infections, was good in all but two cases.\n",
      "Pituitary gonadotropin response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) in males with azo- and oligospermia. Twenty-one males with azo- or oligospermia presenting with infertility and with no evidence of organic disease were studied with luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone (LH-RH). A pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) response was present in all cases and was normal in the majority of the subjects. Serum testosterone and 17 beta estradiol levels were normal in all cases studied. No significant correlations were found between the gonadotropin estimations and sperm count, basal serum testosterone or testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin. It is concluded that LH-RH is of limited diagnostic use in the investigation of this group of patients with male infertility and provides no further insight into the pathogenesis of this condition.\n",
      "Age at the menopause and onset of the climacteric in women of Martin District, Czechoslovkia. Statistical survey and some biological and social correlations. In this study, 6877 women were analysed whose ages ranged between 38 and 58 (born between 1909 and 1929) and who had had no artificial menopause. This is 88.04% of the total female population in this actual period of life, living in Martin District in 1967. The mean age at the menopause was found, by status quo method, to be 51.21 years (standard deviation 4.4), and by the method of weighted arithmetical means, 48.81 years, (standard deviation 3.9). The mean age at the onset of the climacteric, calculated by the same methods, was 47.55 years, or 46.74 years, respectively. The mean age at menarche was 14.6 years. The average birth-rate was 2.8. The mean period of fertility for the series as a whole was 36.6 years. Women with menstrual disturbances had their menopause about 1 year earlier. We have noted a similar tendency in nulliparas and primiparas. We could find no great difference in the age at menopause between those who had had an early or a late menarche. Menstrual disturbances also influenced the onset of the climacteric. It was at least one year earlier than with regular menstruation. Age at menarche and parity had no effect on the age at the onset of climacteric. Women working in agriculture and housewives had their menopause a little later than mean age of the series, whereas manual workers and those in other occupational categories had their menopause and onset of the climacteric about 1 year earlier. Furthermore, single women had their menopause about one year earlier than the married ones. Widows had their menopause twice so often as the married women and they got it very soon after the husbands's death.\n",
      "Fibrinolytic activity of the rat ovum, appearance during tubal passage and disappearance at implantation. Fertilized rat ova were histochemically examined for their fibrinolytic activity. Activity was found during tubal passage, which disappeared at implantation. Simultaneously the fibrinolytic activity of the endometrium disappeared at deciduation. These changes might be a prerequisite for implantation of the zygote.\n",
      "Juvenile diabetes and human sperm quality. Spermiological findings in 25 juvenile diabetics in the age range 16 to 22 years (average 18.5) have been compared with normal spermiological findings in 24 individuals of the same age (16 to 22 years, average 18.7). A drift to lower sperm values in the group of the juvenile diabetics became evident in all parameters observed. As concerns motility and morphology, the differences between the groups reached statistically significant values.\n",
      "On round-headed human spermatozoa. In an infertile man and his only, likewise infertile, brother the sperm contained only round-headed spermatozoa. Electron microscopic examination of embedded ejaculate revealed a malformation, viz. absence of acrosomes in all the spermatozoa with consequent lack of normal development of the heads of the spermatozoa. Acrosomeless spermatozoa were also found in the testicular tubuli. No disturbance of the endocrine functions could be demonstrated. The blood cells were of normal male karyotype. Investigation of meiosis, on the other hand, showed rudimentary second division. Two other unrelated infertile men showed the same isolated disturbance in their spermiogram. Treatment with chlomiphene had no effect on the structure of the spermatozoa or on the infertility. The rare disorder, which seems to be a special syndrome, the first hitherto distinguishable among the various types of teratospermia, and its probable background are discussed.\n",
      "Assessment of the therapeutic effect of epimestrol and epimestrol associated with clomiphene in female sterility. In 24 women with disturbances of ovulation treated for sterility with Epimestrol, ovulation was achieved in 3 patients but none of these became pregnant after therapy. Since it has been suggested that the association of Clomiphene with a weak estrogen might improve the pregnancy rate, we decided to administer Clomiphene associated with Epimestrol. Using this combined therapy in 58 patients, 32 out of the 58 women ovulated and 17 conceived. The overall rate of pregnancy using the combined therapy was no better than that obtained when Clomiphene alone is administered. From this study it is concluded that: (1) Epimestrol is not an effective method for the induction of ovulation, and (2) addition of Epimestrol to Clomiphene is of no clinical benefit.\n",
      "Improvement of fertility and semen quality in men treated with a combination of anticongestive and antibiotic drugs. The effects of a combined therapy of antibiotics and antiinflammatory drugs was evaluated in 344 men referred to our clinic for treatment of infertility. Physical signs of congestion, usually not severe, were detected in 244 men. The treatment caused significant improvement in semen quality, especially in sperm concentration, morphology and motility. Forty percent of the wives became pregnant. There was a striking relationship between increase in morphologically normal spermatozoa and incidence of pregnancy. It is speculated that the therapy had its major effect at the level of the epididymis and/or testis.\n",
      "Genital organs. Auto and homotransplantation in forty dogs. Auto and homo transplantation of the uterus and ovaries was studied in 40 bitches divided into four groups. Group A served as a control. In group B the omentopexy technique of auto-transplantation was used. This method did not prove very rewarding and all 12 grafts were found to have degenerated and were non-functioning when relaparotomy was performed, 3 months after transplantation. In group C, auto transplantation with vascular anastomosis was performed in 12 dogs, yielding satisfactory results including one successful pregnancy and the delivery of 3 healthy puppies. In group D homotransplantation of the internal genital organs was performed in two sets of twin dogs. No immunosuppressive treatment was used. These grafts survived for a limited period as proved by the functional tests and X-ray examination but after 3 months were found to be necrotic and degenerated. Graft function and viability was established by: X-ray examination, cytology of vaginal smears, the effect of gonadotropins on the grafted ovaries and finally relaparotomy undertaken after 3 weeks and 3 months.\n",
      "Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of sperm antibodies in human serum and cervical mucus. Sperm agglutinating antibodies are purified from sera and cervical mucus of women with unexplained causes of infertility which were positive in the FD-test. Fractionation was performed by affinity-chromatography in a batch device and the sperm agglutinating activity controlled by the Franklin and Dukes test. This sperm antibody fraction was determined via crossed immunoelectrophoresis by migration into an anti-human serum containing gel. In all cases only one big peak resulted. The negative control serum and mucus samples demonstrated no precipitation peaks. By absorption studies it was shown that the sperm agglutinating antibodies in sera were IgM and in cervical mucus IgA. The concentration of IgA and IgM was determined by comparison with standard human IgA and IgM. Thus only one serum- and one cervical mucus antibody seems to be responsible for agglutination. The number of experiments, however, is still too small for general conclusions. This method is easily and quickly performed and can therefore be used as a routine method for the determination of sperm agglutinating antibodies. Its application for sperm-immobilizing or cytotoxic activity remains to be tested.\n",
      "Microbiopsy of the fallopian tube as a method for clinical investigation of tubal function in infertility. Microbiopsy of the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube may prove to be a valuable method for investigating the tubal pick-up and transport mechanism in infertility patients. Counting of the percentage of ciliated cells on semithin sections shows that in normal fertile women a percentage of such cells is present that is higher than in abnormal conditions such as peritubal adhesions, ectopic pregnancy and amenorrhoea following prolonged progestogen treatment. It is also suggested that ultrastructural examination of the biopsy may provide additional valuable information.\n",
      "Improvement of sperm motility in patients with asthenozoospermia by kallikrein treatment. Parenteral and oral application of kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.8)--a kinin-releasing proteinase from porcine pancreatic tissue--significantly stimulates quantitative and qualitative sperm motility in subfertile males with semen criteria of asthenozoospermia. Improvement of sperm motility was found to exist for at least 3 months following termination of the 7 week duration kallikrein treatment. Additionally, a significant increase in the number of spermatozoa was observed 3 and 5 months after starting parenteral application of kallikrein.\n",
      "Oligozoospermia: a seven-year survey of the incidence, chromosomal aberrations, treatment and pregnancy rate. No sperm count should be regarded too low to consider extensive treatment in order to improve semen or to correct any possible abnormalities in femal partners. The infertile couple should be given devoted care and advice to improve their sexual relations and their psychological attitude towards the problem of infertility. A pregnancy rate of 51.9% where the husband's count was less than 10 million/ml, offers adequate support for this statement. In cases of mental trauma inflicted on patients by a verdict of inability to achieve parenthood--on people who have already suffered severe psychological shock and tension resulting from a period of infertility--discouragement lessens the already doubtful chances of achieving pregnancy. In no circumstance should oligozoospermic patients receive treatment for infertility unless a chromosomal analysis has been completed and found normal, since our rate of chromosomal anomalies (11.4%) in a group of oligozoospermic patients is considered to be too high.\n",
      "Further studies on the fertility promoting factor from human seminal plasma. A small molecular weight substance from human seminal plasma has been further purified by chromatography. The fertility promoting action of this factor on epididymal sperm has been confirmed in mouse in vitro and in vivo. Experimental evidence indicates that the factor acts on the sperm and not on the eggs. Its possible mode of action is by improving the motility and survival of the epididymal sperm.\n",
      "The presence of paternal H-2 antigens on hybrid mouse blastocysts during experimental delay of implantation and the disappearance of these antigens after onset of implantation. The presence of paternal H-2 antigens on hybrid mouse blastocysts before and during implantation was investigated by means of the isotope anti-globulin technique. It was found that experimentally delayed blastocysts possess paternal H-2 antigens whereas these antigens can no longer be detected 14 hours after estradiol activation of delayed blastocysts.\n",
      "Effect of copper and plastic intra-uterine devices on the fibrinolytic activity of the endometrium in the rat. The effect of copper and plastic intrauterine devices (IUD) on the fibrinolytic activity of the endometrium was studied in the rat. A copper or a plastic device was placed in one of the uterine horns, while the other horn served as a control. Biopsy specimens were obtained from both horns and examined histochemically. The copper concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The fibrinolytic activity of the control horn was found to be localized to small vessels in the outer layer of the uterine wall, while that of the endometrium was low. Plastic as well as copper IUDs increased the fibrinolytic activity which, in contrast with what was seen in the controls, was localized to the endometrium. Compared with the effect of the plastic device, the increase in the fibrinolytic activity induced by the copper device was more widespread in the endometrial area and was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of copper. These findings might help to explain why the contraceptive effect of IUDs is more reliable when they are partly coated with copper.\n",
      "Participation of vitamin A in the maturation of rabbit spermatozoa. Vitamin A concentration was fluorometrically measured in epididymal and ejaculated rabbit spermatozoa and in some of the sperm cells subcellular components. The concentration of vitamin A in the epididymal cells was about one-half that observed in the ejaculated spermatozoa (2.68 as against 1.05 mug/10(8) cells) and seemed to be the same in the sperms obtained from both the head and the tail of the epididymus. The concentration of vitamin A was also found to be significantly higher in the seminal plasma than in the epididymal secretion (0.06 as against 0.039 mug/mg protein respectively). Practically all the vitamin A was found in the fractions obtained by treatment with hypotonic MgCl2 (acrosomal region) and/or with hyamine and dithiothreitol (plasma membrane). It was concluded that the sudden increase in the sperm concentration of vitamin A that occurs upon ejaculation may be required for the stabilization of the acrosomal and plasma membranes.\n",
      "Evaluation of d-norgestrel 1.0 mg as a post-coital contraceptive. Two hundred and ninety-eight women were followed for 2578 months (2739 'bleeding intervals') of treatment with d-Norgestrel 1.0 mg given as a post-coital oral contraceptive. Fourteen pregnancies were recorded (general failure rate, 6.5 per 100 woman/years); at least 6 of these patients did not miss any tablet (corrected failure rate, 2.8). The acceptability rates (life table method) were 0.58 and 0.40 after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The most important medical reason for drop-out was cycle irregularities. The cycle pattern is deeply disturbed by this method of oral contraception.\n",
      "\"Genital dyscrinism\" as a cause of subfertility in mice of the CBA strain. Following four generations of inbred mating (brother-sister) in three direct lineages of CBA strain mice, sterility appeared which from that generation forward became more frequent. The genital organs in animals of both sexes were altered. There was a noticeable occurrence of cysts in the ovaries of female animals already following the third month; in mice approximately one year of age this condition was followed by cystic glandular hyperplasia of the endometrium, sometimes complicated by disturbances in blood circulation, inflammation or even malignancy. In some female animals, manifesting, due to cysts, completely degenerated ovaries, the rest of the genital system was severely atrophic. Male animals frequently showed severe atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium along with preserved interstitial cells and hypertrophic seminal vesicles. These pathological changes represent an independent nosologic unit, for which the label \"genital dyscrinism\" has been proposed. The authors have considered an endocrine mechanism as the possible cause of these pathological changes which are presumed to be genetically conditioned.\n",
      "Motility of the rat oviductal tract isolated in different stages of the sex cycle. Effects of catecholamines. Physiological and pharmacological characteristics of the spontaneous motility of rat oviductal tracts (the coiled oviduct plus its mesosalpinx), isolated in proestrus, estrus or metestrus, are described. The initial contractile tension (recorded following isolation) was comparable in the three stages of the cycle, but its decrement with time was greater in metestrus than in proestrus; the opposite being observed regarding the rate of contractions. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine depress motility in proestrus and metestrus, but not in estrus. The inhibition of motility during proestrus, produced by added norepinephrine, phenylephrine or isoproterenol was not modified by phenotolamine but was abolished by propranolol. During estrus, norepinephrine and phenylephrine inhibited tubal contractions of preparations incubated with phentolamine, whereas it produced a distinct stimulation in the presence of propranolol. It is concluded that: (a) the rat mesosalpinx might play some role in the motility of the whole isolated oviductal tract; (b) there are variations in the decrement with time of contractile tension and frequency of contractions in different stages of the sex cycle; (c) the effects of catecholamines upon the rat oviductal tract also varies within the cycle, probably due to influences imposed by sex hormones.\n",
      "The effect of prostaglandins and prostaglandin inhibitors on spermatogenesis. The effect of the prostaglandin inhibitors, aspirin and indomethacin and of prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2 on spermatogenesis in the mature male mouse has been studied. Aspirin at 100 mg/kg and at 200 mg/kg, and indomethacin at 1.0 mg/kg given orally twice a day for fifteen days produced a marked increase in spermatogenesis. The number of step 7 spermatids increased significantly over controls at about the same rate in all three groups. No significant changes in seminal vesicle weight or testicular weight was noted, although testicular weight did show an increase. Administration of prostaglandins E1 and E2 subcutaneously in doses of either 2 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg once a day for fifteen days produced a marked decrease in spermatogenesis. Step 7 spermatids decreased significantly at both dosage levels of PGE2 and at the higher dosage level of PGE1. Spermatocyte showed a significant decrease at the higher dose of PGE2. Testicular weight showed a significant decrease at the higher dose of PGE2. Seminal vesicle weight showed a significant decrease at the lower dose of PGE1 and at the higher dose of PGE2. Epididymal weight decreased at the higher dose of PGE2. Increased numbers of exfoliated immature germ cells and mature spermatozoa were observed in the epididymus of both the PGE1 and PGE2 treated animals.\n",
      "Low fertility rate in vasovasostomized males and its possible immunologic mechanism. Contradictory views have been expressed about the role of the various antisperm antibodies which develop after vasoligation. The present study was conducted in 50 normal fertile males, 50 vasectomized subjects and 25 subjects after recanalization of their vas deferens in order to investigate the development of various anti-sperm antibodies after vasectomy, along with their incidence, their persistence after successful relief of vaso-obstruction by vasovasostomy and their role in the causation of infertility in vasoanatomized normospermia males. Sperm agglutinating, immobilizing and haemagglutinating antibodies showed rises in titres with increase during the post-vasectomy period, indicating continuous antigenic stimulus. Age, post-operative complications and blood group did not seem to alter the results. 86% of subjects developed antisperm agglutinins, mostly tail-to-tail type (54.5%), 1-12 years after vasoligation, while only 2% of fertile men had circulating spermagglutinins. A lower incidence of positive sperm in the immobilization test than in the agglutination test suggests either that different antibodies are detected by these two tests or these tests have differing sensitivities. Of the 25 vasovasostomized subject, 13 (52%) cases became normospermic and 4 (16%) oligospermic while 8 (32%) remained azoospermics. Except for 3 oligospermic subjects, all had circulating spermagglutinins. Among the 13 normospermic vasovasostomized persons, a significant correlation was found between the titres of circulating antisperm agglutinins and autoagglutination of spermatozoa in their ejaculates; and also between the sperm immobilization values of their sera and the degree of their sperm motility. Three normospermic recanalized men, having low levels of sperm agglutinins and haemagglutinins with normal seminogram and no sperm immobilizing antibody, successfully impregnated their wives. Another 10 vasovasotomized infertile subjects had sperm agglutinins in significant titre; 5 showed positive sperm immobilization values, a similar number showed autoagglutination of sperm, while a decreased degree of motility of sperms was noted in 6 cases. Thus there was a significant correlation between the titres of anti-sperm antibodies and autoagglutination of spermatozoa, which might be an important cause of male infertility after successful anatomic relief of vasoobstruction. Histological studies of testicular biopsy showed normal spermatogenesis in azoospermic recanalized subjects, although they had high levels of antisperm antibodies. This suggests that these antibodies do not affect normal spermatogenesis, and sperm counts.\n",
      "Studies on urinary arylsulphatase activity in vitamin A deficient rats. Urinary arylsulphatases (E.C.3.1.6.1) A and B were increased in male rats fasted for 24 hours. Excretion of non dialysable protein nitrogen decreased whereas creatinine excretion increased. On refeeding diet arylsulphatase A activity was restored to normal whereas arylsulphatase B was not normalised. A single oral supplementation of vitamin A acetate (20 000 IU) to rats fasted for 24 hours resulted in a significant reduction of both arylsulphatase A and B eventhough no further reduction of protein nitrogen excretion was evident. In vitamin A deficient male rats significant reduction in urinary excretion of both arylsulphatases A and B occured. In a smaller number of female rats depression of only arylsulphatase A was observed. This effect of vitamin A deficiency leading to reduced urinary arylsulphatase activity was evident even at the \"weight plateau\" stage when no reduction in food intake or growth had  occurred. These results suggest a possible direct or indirect role for vitamin A on urinary excretion pattern of arylsulphatases presumably released from lysosomes of tissues.\n",
      "Effect of long-term starvation on the rat liver lysosomes. The effect of 120- and 240-h starvation on rats hepatocytes ultrastructure and particularly the changes of the lysosomes were studied. Eelectronmicroscopically and cytochemically there have been observed diminution of the number of mitochondria and degranulation and vacuolzation of the ER. At the same time Golgi complex was hypertrophied and the number of lysosomes was much increased, mainly those of the autophagic type. Biochemically was shown, that the activity of some acid hydrolases (beta-glucosidase, alpha- and beta-galactosidases, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatases A and B) in the liver of starved rats was markedly expressed. The sedimentation properties of the lysosomes and the lysosomal membrane stability was damaged as well. The data received have been discussed in the light of the reconstructive role of lysosomes.\n",
      "Hypogastric carotid bypass for Takayasu's disease. Two cases of Takayasu's disease are presented which were successfully resolved by a Dacron graft from the right hypogastric artery to the right internal carotid artery. We recommend this bypass procedure of connecting the hypogastric artery to one of the aortic branches. Medical treatment with antibiotics, steroids and anti-coagulants has not been satisfactory.\n",
      "Psychopharmacology research ward. Ten years' experience. The differences between the results of controlled clinical research and the experiences of the practitioners can be attributed to a certain extent to the artificiality of the setting in which controlled studies are performed. The system developed in the wards of the Department of Psychopharmacology of the Institute of Psychiatry in Prague is an attempt to overcome some of these difficulties. Certain similarities exist between this system called continuous controlled trial and 'silent' trial proposed by Ross et al. The main characteristics of the system are: (1) all patients admitted to the ward are assigned to the trial without exception; (2) the trial goes on continuously without interruption for more than 10 years; (3) except that the patients do not know the quality of drugs administered they do not realize any difference between this research setting and the usual routine treatment. The advantages of this system are: reduction of artificiality; the possibility to perform early clinical trials in controlled conditions and to shorten the usual three-phase testing of a new drug; the possibility to perform long-term, longitudinal studies with individual patients admitted several times in double-blind conditions.\n",
      "[Comparative study of three psychotropics for treatment of depressions]. The effect of three anti-depressive psychotropes (Clorimipramine, Doxepine and Dibenzepine) was studied in 107 depressed patients. In each patient the mean value of twelve symptoms was evaluated and compared weekly (for 4 weeks), by statistical methods. In addition, the effect of each drug was analysed in personality stratus. A thymeretic and thymoanaleptic rapid action on 'corporality' and 'endotimic-vital' layer was found with Clorimipramine. Doxepine acts rapidly with sedative and anxiolitic actions on reactive symptoms related with personality super-structures having long term anti-depressive effects. Dibenzepine has a thymeretic rapid and intensive action and a slow thymoanaleptic effect on the same personality stratus of Clorimipramine.\n",
      "Properties of rat lens phosphofructokinase. Two interconvertible forms of phosphofructokinase (PFK) have been eluted from a DEAE-cellulose column from the supernatant fraction of rat lens homogenates centrifuged at 96,000 x g for 1 hour at 0 to 4 degrees C. The interconversion can be manipulated by a change in the pH of the extracting and eluting buffers. PFK-I is the dominant form at pH between 7.4 to 7.05, while PFK-II dominates at pH 7.4 to 8.2. PFK-II is believed to be the functional form; it is inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and the inhibitory effect is enhanced by more acidic pH. Fructose-6-phosphate counteracts ATP inhibition, but the most potent de-inhibitors are ADP and AMP. Among the inorganic ions tested, sulfate, phosphate, ammonium, and potassium also de-inhibit, whereas calcium further inhibits the enzyme. The behavior of PFK under physiologic conditions and the significance of the presence of two forms of PFK in the lens are discussed.\n",
      "Effects of pregnancy on the development of acute uremic syndrome in the rat. We evaluated the contributory role which gestational metabolic adaptions may play in the development of acute uremic syndrome in rats by studying the effects of nephrectomy in pregnant and nonpregnant animals. Whereas no significant differences in creatinine and uric acid concentrations were found between control and pregnant rats, urea concentrations were significantly lower in the pregnant animals before, as well as well as 6, 12 and 24 h after, bilateral nephrectomy. It is suggested that creatinine production, which is related to muscle mass, is not altered during late gestation, whereas urea synthesis, which is affected by catabolic and anabolic factors, is significantly reduced.\n",
      "Blood-gas analysis and the assessment of acid-base status. In this article the more common kinds of acid-base disorders have been discussed. To accurately assess the kind of acid-base disturbance found in a patient, the clinician must know the arterial pH, PaCO2, and the [HCO-3] in arterial blood. Acid-base disturbances are associated with fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Potassium balance is often upset in acid-base disturbances. Accurate determination of K+ balance requires serial or repeated determinations of plasma K+ concentration as well as careful clinical monitoring.\n",
      "Intracellular distinction between peroxidase and catalase in exocrine cells of rat lacrimal gland: a biochemical and cytochemical study. The lacrimal gland (Glandula orbitalis externa) of rat contains both peroxidase and catalase and was used as a model for biochemical and cytochemical distinction between peroxidase and catalase. Both enzymes were isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation from tissue homogenates, and the effects of fixation with glutaraldehyde and various conditions of incubation were investigated colorimetrically using DAB as hydrogen donor. The lacrimal gland peroxidase is strongly inhibited by glutaraldehyde treatment. In contrast, for catalase the fixation with glutaraldehyde is the prerequistie for demonstration of its peroxidatic activity. The maximal peroxidatic activity was obtained after treatment of catalase with 3% glutaraldehyde, higher concentrations being inhibitory. For lacrimal gland peroxidase, the maximal rate of oxidation of DAB is at pH 6.5, whereas for catalase it is at pH 10.5. The optimal concentration of H2O2 for lacrimal gland peroxidase is at 10(-3)M and for peroxidatic activity of catalase at 10(-1)M. These optimal conditions obtained biochemically were applied to tissue sections of rat lacrimal gland. After the fixation of tissue with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde and incubation in the DAB medium at neutral pH containing 10(-3)M H2O2 (Peroxidase medium), the reaction product was localized in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, in elements of the Golgi apparatus, and in secretory granules. After the fixation of tissue with 3% glutaraldehyde and incubation in the DAB-medium containing 10(-1)M H2O2 and at pH 10.5 (catalase medium), the staining in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi-apparatus and in secretory granules was completely inhibited and reaction product was localized exclusively in small (0.2-0.5 mu) particles similar to small peroxisomes described in various other cell-types.\n",
      "Arterial blood-gas interpretations in the respiratory intensive-care unit. The role of the nurse in the respiratory intensive-care unit requires increased sophistication as our knowledge of the patient becomes more complex. This expanded role should include a thorough understanding of disturbances in acid-base balance, the relationship of PaCO2 to ventilation, the difference in acute and chronic respiratory problems, and the causes and treatment of hypoxemia. The ability to analyze and evaluate blood-gas determinations is simply one more important tool the nurse may utilize in the care and treatment of the critically ill patient.\n",
      "Antimycin A fermentation. II. Fermentation in aerated-agitated fermenters. Fermentation characteristics, previously studied in shake flasks, were reproduced in aerated-agitated fermenters, using three strains of Streptomyces sp. which had been selected for their high antimycin A productivity in shake flasks. Fermentation in fermenters was run in three stages. The medium consisted of soy flour, glucose, ammonium sulfate and calcium carbonate; initial pH was 7.2 approximately 7.5, and temperature 25 degrees C. The course of fermentation was then modified to encourage maximal growth and eliminate the intermediate lag period observed in shake flasks. Useful corrections included continuous addition of soybean oil at 1.25 %/day and maintenance of pH at 6 by addition of ammonium hydroxide on demand. The ammonium hydroxide added also served as a rapidly utilized nitrogen source and could not be replace by NaOH or KOH. Under optimal conditions antimycin A was produced at constant rate from the second to the sixth day, when maximum yields of more than 9 g/liter were attained. A procedure for antimycin A extraction is described.\n",
      "Nutritionally defined conditions for germination of Streptomyces viridochromogenes spores. Spores of Streptomyces viridochromogenes were removed from the surface of solid media with glass beads and suspended in a buffer-detergent solution. Addition of yeast extract and glucose resulted in rapid loss of refractility of the spores. Appearance of germ tubes followed. Germination was accompanied by a decrease in the optical density (OD) of the suspension. The OD decrease was used as an assay for germination. A defined germination medium (DGM) comprised of L-alanine, L-glutamic acid, adenosine, para-aminobenzoic acid, and calcium and magnesium ions provided a germination rate nearly equal to that of complex media. The germination rate was essentially the same if D-alanine and D-glutamate replaced the L-isomers. The optimum pH and temperature for germination were 7.0 and 35 C. Germination was absolutely dependent on the presence of CO2. Spores harvested after growth for longer periods than the usual time (10 days) became less germinable in DGM. The same was observed for spores grown at 37 C as compared with 30 C. Spores incubated in DGM for various time periods before being transferred to a buffer solution did not continue to germinate. Spores harvested after growth of eight species of Streptomyces did not show a decrease in OD when incubated in yeast extract medium. Another strain of S. viridochromogenes did exhibit an OD decrease in the medium. Comparative properties of spores of streptomycetes, fungi, and bacilli are discussed.\n",
      "Effect of pH on competence development and deoxyribonucleic acid uptake in Streptococcus sanguis (Wicky). Streptococcus sanguis (Wicky) cells, strain WE4, developed little or no competence and failed to autolyze in permissive conditions when treated with competence factor (CF) below PH 7.0. This lack of activity was directly correlated with the inability of the cells to bind or take up CF at pH values of 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5. On the other hand, competent cells bound deoxyribonucleic acid molecules maximally below pH 7.0 and transformed maximally at pH 6.5. Deoxyribonucleic acid was optimally bound to cells in a deoxyribonuclease-resistant form at pH values between 7.0 and 8.5. Concomitant with this binding, undefined acid-soluble DNA fragments appeared in the culture menstrua. CF binding and uptake by cells was not only influenced by low pH but also by low temperature. At 0 C, WE4 cells bound only 4% of the input CF and took up less than 1% into a trypsin-insensitive state compared to cells treated at 37 C. Cells treated with CF at 0 C did not autolyze when transferred to permissive conditions. The results presented in this report extend earlier findings that showed that competence development and autolysis are related to the uptake of CF.\n",
      "Control of inositol biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: properties of a repressible enzyme system in extracts of wild-type (Ino+) cells. Inositol biosynthesis was studied in soluble, cell extracts of a wild-type (Ino) strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Two reactions were detected: (i) conversion of D-glucose-6-phosphate to a phosphorylated form of inositol, presumably inositol-1-phosphate (IP synthethase, EC5.5.1.4), and (ii) conversion of phosphorylated inositol to inositol (IP phosphatase, EC3.1.3.25).  The in vitro rate of conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to inositol was proportional to incubaion time and enzyme concentration.  The pH optimum was 7.0.  The synthesis of inositol required oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and was stimulated byNH4C1 and MgC12.  NADP substituted poorly for NAD, and NADH inhibitedthe reaction.  Phosphorylated inositol accumulated in the absence of MgC12, suggesting that inositol-phosphate is an intermediate in the pathway and that Mg ions stimulate the dephosphorylation of inositol-phosphate.  IP synthetase was inhibited approximately 20% in the presence of inositol in the reaction mixture at concentrations exceeding 1 mM.  The enzyme was repressed approximately 50-fold when inositol was present in the growth medium at concentrations exceeding 50 muM.  IP synthetase reached the fully repressed level approximately 10 h after the addition of inositol to logarithmic cultures grown in the absence of inositol.  The specific activity of the enzyme increased with time in logarithmically growing cultures lacking inositol andapproached the fully depressed level as the cells entered stationary phase.\n",
      "Heat activation of Streptomyces viridochromogenes spores. The lag period preceding germination of Streptomyces viridochromogenes spores during incubation in a defined germination medium was completely eliminated by a gentle heat shock. The rate of germination was not affected. The optimum pH for activation extended from 6.0 to 9.6. The time of heating required for maximum activation was 1 min at 60 C, 2 to 5 min at 55 C, 20 min at 50 C, and 40 to 50 min at 45 C. Activated spores had the same temperature and pH optima and nutritional requirements for germination as unactivated spores. Activated spores deactivated during incubation for 8 h at 25 C and were activated again by a second heat shock. Spores that had been aged for 4 weeks or longer did not germinate in the defined germination medium unless they were first heat activated.\n",
      "Glucose transport in isolated prosthecae of Asticcacaulis biprosthecum. Active transport of glucose in prosthecae isolated from cells of Asticcacaulis biprosthecum was stimulated by the non-physiological electron donor N, N, N', N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. Glucose uptake was mediated by two transport systems; the apparent Km of the high-affinity system was 1.8 muM and that of the low-affinity system was 34 muM. Free glucose accumulated within prosthecae at a concentration 60 to 200 times above that present externally, depending on the Km of the system being observed. The glucose transport system in prosthecae was stereospecific for D-glucose, and neither methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside nor 2-deoxyglucose was transported. Uptake of glucose was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), and the inhibition by PCMB but not by NEM was reversed by dithiothreitol. Glucose uptake was also inhibited by the uncoupling agents 5-chloro-3-t-butyl-2'-nitrosalicylanilide (S-13), 5-chloro-3-(p-chlorophenyl)-4'-chlorosalicylanilide (S-6), and carbonyl-cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and by the respiratory inhibitor KCN. Efflux of glucose from preloaded prosthecae was induced by PCMB and KCN, but not by S-13 or CCCP. Glucose uptake was not affected by arsenate or an inhibitor of membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatases, N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The lack of inhibition by these two compounds, combined with the extremely low levels of adenosine 5'-triphosphate present in prosthecae, indicates that adenosine 5'-triphosphate is not involved in the transport of glucose by prosthecae.\n",
      "Defective synthesis of lipid intermediates for peptidoglycan formation in a stabilized L-form of Streptococcus pyogenes. Membrane preparations obtained from a stabilized L-form of Streptococcus pyogenes are incapable of synthesizing peptidoglycan from uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-D-muramyl-L-Ala-D-iso-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala and uridine-5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, in contrast with similar preparations from the parental streptococcus. Furthermore, 50-fold higher levels of lipid intermediates which serve as membrane-bound substrates for peptidoglycan synthesis are synthesized in reaction mixtures containing streptococcal membranes than with similar preparations from the L-form. These observations suggest that the inability of this stabilized L-form to form a cell wall in vivo lies, at least in part, in its failure to synthesize significant quantities of the lipid substrates for peptidoglycan synthesis.\n",
      "Protonmotive force as the source of energy for adenosine 5'-triphosphate synthesis in Escherichia coli. Net synthesis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in energy-depleted cells of Escherichia coli was observed when an inwardly directed protonmotive force was artificially imposed. In wild-type cells, ATP synthesis occurred whether the protonmotive force was dominated by the membrane potential (negative inside) or the pH gradient (alkaline inside). Formation of ATP did not occur unless the protonmotive force exceeded a value of 200 mV. Under these conditions, no ATP synthesis was found when cells were exposed to an inhibitor of the membrane-bound Ca2+- and Mg2+- stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or to a proton conductor, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone. Adenosine triphosphatase-negative mutants failed to show ATP synthesis in response to either a membrane potential or a pH gradient. ATP synthesis driven by a protonmotive force was observed in a cytochrome-deficient mutant. These observations are consistent with the chemiosmotic hypothesis of Mitchell (1961, 1966, 1974).\n",
      "Inhibition of dimethyl ether and methane oxidation in Methylococcus capsulatus and Methylosinus trichosporium. Metal-chelating or -binding agents inhibited the oxidation of dimethyl ether and methane, but not methanol, by cell suspensions of Methylococcus capsulatus and Methylosinus trichosporium. Evidence suggests that the involvement of metal-containing enzymatic systems in the initial step of oxidation of dimethyl ether and methane.\n",
      "Effect of colicin K on a membrane-associated, energy-linked function. The purpose of this work was in investigate the capability of cell extracts of Escherichia coli and E. coli treated with colicin K to catalyze the following energy-dependent reverse transhydrogenase reaction: NADP + NADH + ATP in equilibrium NADPH + NAD +ADP + Pi. Under anaerobic conditions this reaction requires the presence of a specific portion of the electron transport chain, a functional energy coupling system, including an adenosine triphosphatase, enzyme, and ATP as energy source. The ATP-linked reaction was partially inhibited in French press extracts of E. coli K-12 C600 cells that had been pretreated with colicin K but not in extracts from similarly treated cells of a colicin-tolerant mutant. Ultracentrifugation of extracts yielded particulate fractions competent in catalyzing the reaction; this reaction is substantially inhibited in fractions from colicin-treated cells. The extent of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of colicin. Supernatants also supported ATP-linked formation of NADPH, but this reaction was insensitive to the colicin effect. A comparison between the requirement of the reaction in supernatant and particulate fractions suggests that the reaction in the supernatant is different from the one inhibited by colicin. The ATP-hydrolyzing ability of particulate fractions from the control or treated bacteria was identical. Likewise, the electron transport chain was not affected by colicin treatment, as evidenced from lack of effect on NADH oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and NADPH-NAD transhydrogenase. It is concluded that colicin K interferes with the coupling of ATP the utilization of the intermediate for the ATP-linked transdehydrogenase reaction.\n",
      "Ribonucleic acid synthesized in meiotic cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: effect of culture medium pH. Pulse-labeled ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from polysomes of sporulating cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized in sucrose gradients and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and heterodisperse RNA, presumed to be messenger RNA, were synthesized during a 20-min pulse at T4 and T6 when labeling was performed in sporulation medium adjusted to pH 6.0. Furthermore, ribosomal RNA was processed into functional ribosomes during the pulse. The specific activity of pulse-labeled RNA of cells labeled in sporulation medium where the pH was unadjusted at T4 (pH 7.8) and T9 (pH 8.6) was 20- to 50-fold lower than RNA from cells labeled at pH 6.0. The low specific activity resulted from a 50-fold reduction in uptake of labeled precursors when the medium pH was greater than 7.2. However, heterodisperse RNA ranging from 4-17S in size and transfer RNA were synthesized during the pulse at T4 (pH 7.8),but the low specific activity of ribosomal RNA prevented a thorough analysis of its synthesis. Cellular impermeability at T9 (pH 8.6) resulted in minimal uptake of label, and an analysis of pulse-labeled transcripts was impossible. A comparison of the percantage of polysomal material indicate, however, that these cells were at least as active in translation as cells pulse-labeled at pH 6.0.\n",
      "An enzyme common to histidine and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis. Two transaminases exist for tyrosine and phenylalanine synthesis in Bacillus subtilis. One enzyme is also responsible for the transamination of imidazole acetol phosphate to histidinol phosphate, an obligatory reaction in the synthesis of histidine. The gene involved in the synthesis of this enzyme lies in the middle of a cluster of genes, all of which are concerned with the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids. The other gene has not yet been mapped. Mutants have been isolated that lack one or the other enzyme activity. These mutants are prototrophic for tyrosine and phenylalanine. However, both classes of mutants are more sensitive than the wild-type strain to the phenylalanine analogue, fluorophenylalanine, suggesting that each of these mutants synthesizes less phenylalanine than does the wild-type strain. The two enzymes can be separated from one another by ion-exchange chromatography and glycerol-gradient centrifugation. The significance of the observation that an enzyme of histidine synthesis also plays a role in the synthesis of the aromatic acids is considered in light of cross-pathways regulation between the two pathways.\n",
      "Regulation of Chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase and prephenate dehydrogenase from alcaligenes eutrophus. Highly purified enzymes from Alcaligenes eutrophus H 16 were used for kinetic studies. Chorismate mutase was feedback inhibited by phenylalanine. In the absence of the inhibitor, the double-reciprocal plot was linear, yielding a Km for chorismate of 0.2 mM. When phenylalanine was present, a pronounced deviation from the Michaelis-Menten hyperbola occurred. The Hill coefficient (n) was 1.7, and Hill plots of velocity versus inhibitor concentrations resulted in a value of n' = 2.3, indicating positive cooperativity. Chorismate mutase was also inhibited by prephenate, which caused downward double-reciprocal plots and a Hill coefficient of n = 0.7, evidence for negative cooperativity. The pH optimum of chorismate mutase ranged from 7.8 to 8.2; its temperature optimum was 47 C. Prephenate dehydratase was competitively inhibited by phenylalanine and activated by tyrosine. Tyrosine stimulated its activity up to 10-fold and decreased the Km for prephenate, which was 0.67 mM without effectors. Tryptophan inhibited the enzyme competitively. Its inhibition constant (Ki = 23 muM) was almost 10-fold higher than that determined for phenylalanine (Ki = 2.6 muM). The pH optimum of prephenate dehydratase was pH 5.7; the temperature optimum was 48 C. Prephenate dehydrogenase was feedback inhibited by tyrosine. Inhibition was competitive with prephenate (Ki = 0.06 mM) and noncompetitive with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The enzyme was further subject to product inhibition by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (Ki = 0.13 mM). Its Km for prephenate was 0.045 mM, and that for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was 0.14 mM. The pH optimum ranged between 7.0 and 7.6; the temperature optimum was 38 C. It is shown how the sensitive regulation of the entire enzyme system leads to a well-balanced amino acid production.\n",
      "Role of deoxyribonucleic acid ligase in a doxyribonucleic acid membrane fraction extracted from pneumococci. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ligase has been detected in a DNA membrane fraction extracted from Pneumococcus. The specific activity of the enzyme in this fraction is 10-fold greater than in the remaining cell extract. It remains firmly bound (with other enzymes) to the complex after a purification procedure in which a considerable percentage of the macromolecules are dissociated. The ligase acts in two ways in the DNA membrane fraction in vitro. One, it catalyzes the linkage of small-molecular-weight pieces of newly synthesized DNA into heavier-molecular-weight DNA strands as shown by others (M Gellert, 1976; R. Okazaki, A. Sugino, S. Hirose, T. Okazaki, Y. Imae, R. Kainuma-Kuroda, T. Ogawa, M. Arisawa, and Y. Kurosowa, 1973; B. Olivera and I. Lehman, 14; and A. Sugino, S. Hirose, and R. Okazaki, 1972) and, two, it protects DNA from degradation by deoxyribonucleases. This latter effect is due to a competition between the ability of the nucleases to degrade DNA and the ability of DNA ligase to seal the nicks produced by these degradative enzymes. The ligase acts cooperatively with other enzymes in the DNA membrane fraction to synthesize DNA.\n",
      "Relationship between hemagglutinin and sialidase from Clostridium perfringens CN3870: chromatographic characterization of the biologically active proteins. Biochemical characterization of hemagglutinin and sialidase activities from Clostridium perfringens strain CN3870 revealed that this strain produced three sialidase enzymes that were separable to gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of sialidase I, II, and III activities were 310,000 +/- 10,000, 105,000 +/- 4,000 and 64,000 +/- 2,000, respectively, the first figure being an approximate value only.\n",
      "Relationship between hemagglutinin and sialidase from Clostridium perfringens CN3870: gel filtration of mutant and reverant activities. Gel filtration of supernatant fluids, from the wild-type Clostridium perfringens, strain CN3870, and several of the mutants and reverants derived from this strain, showed that these mutants failed to product detectable amounts of still produced sialidase III activity. The reverants tested had regained the ability to produce approximately wild-type levels of the I and II forms of both activities. These results showthat there is a direct relationship between the production of the I form and hemagglutinin and sialidase activities and the production of the II form of these biologically active proteins. Models that explain the genetic basis for these results are discussed.\n",
      "Development of Microbodies in the yeast Kloeckera growing on methanol. A number of microbodies appear regularly in methanol-grown yeast cells, but rarely in ethanol- or glucose-grown cells. When one of representative methanol-utilizing yeasts, Kloeckera sp.no. 2201 (also known as Candida bodinii), was cultured on glucose and then transferred into a methanol medium, microbodies of small size could be observed in 2-h old cells. The number of microbodies per sectioned cell reached five to six after 4 h of cultivation. Though the number of microbodies did not change during prolonged cultivation, their size became larger with the passage of cultivation time. The activities of catalase and alcohol oxidase were confirmed in the particulate fractions throughout the cultivation period, whereas the activities of formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase were not detected in the particles. The activity of isocitrate lyase was detected in the particulate fractions only at the early growth phase.\n",
      "Phosphatase of Chlamydomonas reinhardi: biochemical and cytochemical approach with specific mutants. The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardi produces two constitutive acid phosphatases and three depressible phosphatases (a neutral and two alkaline ones) that can utilize napthyl phosphate as a substrate. Specific mutants depressible phosphatase were used to investigate biochemical properties and the cytochemical localization of these enzymes. The two constitutive phosphatases show similar pH optima (about 5.0) and Km values (2 x 10(-3) to 3.3 x 10(-3) M) but differ in their heat sensitivity and affinity for glycerophosphate.\n",
      "Autolysis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Autolysis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was studied under different conditions. It was found that low pH and temperature, as well as the presence of divalent cations, spermine, sucrose, and polyvinylpyrrolidone, stabilized nongrowing gonococci. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid alone promoted lysis, whereas lysozyme had only a limited additive effect. The autolytic behavior of gonococci appears to be connected with their prolonged cell division process. The relative dependence on the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer for the mechanical stability of gonococci is discussed.\n",
      "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Purification and partial characterization. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase has been purified 1000-fold from pig liver. This enzyme exists as an active dimer of molecular weight 133,000 and an inactive monomer of molecular weight 67,500. The pH of maximum activity is 8.5 and the ionic strength maximum is 0.1 to 0.5 M. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is highly specific for NADP+ and glucose 6-phosphate. Apparent Km values of 3.6 muM and 5.4 muM were obtained for glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+. This enzyme is located almost entirely within the soluble portion of the cellular cytoplasm.\n",
      "A kinetic study of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The steady state kinetics of pig liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is consistent with an ordered, sequential mechanism in which NADP is bound first and NADPH released last. Kia is 9.0 muM, Ka is 4.8 muM, and Kb is 36 muM. Glucosamine 6-phosphate, a substrate analogue and competitive inhibitor, is used to help rule out a possible random mechanism. ADP is seen to form a complex with the free form of the enzyme whereas ATP forms a complex with both the free and E-NADP forms of the enzyme. The KI for the E-ADP complex is 1.9 mM, while the Ki values for the E-ATP and E-NADP-ATP complexes are 7.2 and 4.5 mM, respectively.\n",
      "alpha-Aminomethylglutarate, a beta-amino analog of glutamate that interacts with glutamine synthetase and the enzymes that catalyze glutathione synthesis. The glutamate analog, alpha-aminomethylglutaric acid, was synthetized by Michael addition of ammonia to 2-methylene glutaronitrile followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate alpha-aminomethylglutaryl nitrile; the analog cyclizes readily on heating to 2-piperidone-5-carboxylic acid. Sheep brain glutamine synthetase utilizes one isomer of DL-alpha-aminomethylglutarate at about 10% of the rate with L-glutamate. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase uses both isomers of DL-alpha-aminomethylglutarate, preferentially acting on the same isomer used by glutamine synthetase. gamma-(alpha-Aminomethyl)glutaryl-alpha-aminobutyrate, prepared enzymatically with gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, was found to be a substrate and an inhibitor of glutathione synthetase. alpha-Aminomethylglutarate does not inhibit gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase appreciably. When alpha-aminomethylglutarate was administered to mice, there were substantial decreases in the levels of glutamine, glutathione, glutamate, and glycine in the kidney, and of glutamine and glutamate in the liver, indicating that this glutamate analog is effective as an inhibitor of glutamine and glutathione synthesis in vivo, and suggesting that it may also inhibit other enzymes.\n",
      "Studies of human kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Purification and structural, kinetic and immunological properties. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase, present in various mammalian tissues, transfers the gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione to a variety of acceptor amino acids and peptides. This enzyme has been purified from human kidney cortex about 740-fold to a specific activity of 200 units/mg of protein. The purification steps involved incubation of the homogenate at 37 degrees followed by centrifugation and extraction of the sediment with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% sodium deoxycholate; batchwise absorption on DEAE-cellulose; DEAE-cellulose (DE52) column chromatography; Sephadex G-200 gel filtration; and affinity chromatography using concanavalin A insolubilized on beaded Agarose. Detergents were used throughout the purification of the enzyme. The purified enzyme separated into three protein bands, all of which had enzyme activity, on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis in the presence of Triton X-100. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of about 90,000 as shown by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, and appears to be a tetramer with subunits of molecular weights of about 21,000. The Km for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase using the artificial substrate, gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, with glycylglycine as the acceptor amino acid was found to be about 0.8 mM. The optimum pH for the enzyme activity is 8.2 and the isoelectric point is 4.5. Both GSH and GSSG competitively inhibited the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase when gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide was used as the substrate. Treatment of the purified enzyme with papain has no effect on the enzyme activity or mobility on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. The purified gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase had no phosphate-independent glutaminase activity. The ratio of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to phosphate-independent glutaminase changed significantly through the initial steps of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase purification. These studies indicate that the transpeptidase and phosphate-independent glutaminase activities are not exhibited by the same protein in human kidney.\n",
      "Kinetics of the hemerythrin-oxygen interaction. The kinetics of the reaction of Golfingia gouldii hemerythrin with O2 have been studied by stopped flow spectrophotometry. For the second order oxygenation process, k1 = 7.4 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, deltaH1++ = 8.2 kcal-mol-1 and deltaS1++ = +1 e.u. at 25 degrees, pH 8.2, and I = 0.015 M. The rate constant is unchanged when protein concentration is varied from 3 to 25 muM, the ionic strength is increased to 0.07 M, and the pH moved to 6.8. The deoxygenation of oxyhemerythrin is studied with stopped flow by scavenging liberated O2 with S2O4(2-). For the first order dissociation, k-1 = 51 s-1, deltaH-1++ = 20.6 kcal-mol-1 and deltaS-1++ = +19 e.u. at 25 degrees, pH 8.2, and I = 0.015 M. The value of k-1 is independent of [protein] = 50 to 200 muM, [S2O4(2-)] = 5 to 100 mM I = 0.015 to 0.30 M and pH 6.8 to 9.0. Using myoglobin instead of S2O4(2-) as scavenger gives similar results. Combination of activation parameters for the oxygenation and deoxygenation processes gives K1 = 1.5 X 10(5) M-1, deltaH = -12.4 kcal-mol-1, and deltaS = -18 e.u., values in good agreement with independent thermodynamic data. Perchlorate ion (0.05 M) enhances k-1 about 3-fold and hardly effects k1. There is no sign of other than a single reaction in either direction, and octameric hemerythrin apparently behaves kinetically as eight single units.\n",
      "Guanylate cyclase and cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase activities and cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels in normal and transformed fibroblasts in culture. To investigate the role of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in cultured cells we have measured guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activities and cyclic GMP levels in normal and transformed fibroblastic cells. Guanylate cyclase activity is found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction of normal rat kidney (NRK) and BALB 3T3 cells. Enzyme activity is stimulated 3- to 10-fold by treatment with the detergent Lubrol PX. However, enhancement of guanylate cyclase by fibroblast growth factor could not be demonstrated under a variety of assay conditions. In both NRK and BALB 3T3 cells guanylate cyclase activity is low during logarithmic growth and increases as the cells crowd together and growth slows. Guanylate cyclase activity is undetectable in homogenates of NRK cells transformed by the Kirsten sarcoma virus (KNRK cells) either in the presence or absence of Lubrol PX. Guanylate cyclase activity is also greatly decreased in NRK cells transformed by Moloney, Schmidt-Ruppin, or Harvey viruses. BALB 3T3 cells transformed by RNA viruses (Kirsten, Harvey, or Moloney), by a DNA virus (SV40), by methylcholanthrene, or spontaneously, all have diminished but readily detectable guanylate cyclase activity. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is found predominately in the soluble fraction of NRK cells. This activity increases slightly as NRK cells enter the stationary growth phase. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is undetectable in two clones of KNRK cells under a variety of assay conditions, and is decreased relative to the level present in NRK cells in a third KNRK clone. However, both Moloney- and Schmidt-Ruppin-transformed NRK cells have a phosphodiesterase activity similar to that found in NRK cells. Boiled supernatant from both NRK and KNRK cells is observed to appreciably enhance the activity of activator-deficient phosphodiesterase from bovine heart. This result indicates that the absence of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity in KNRK cells is not due to a loss of the phosphodiesterase activator. The intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP is found to be very low in transformed NRK cells when compared to levels measured in confluent NRK cells. The low levels of cyclic GMP in transformed NRK cells reflect the greatly decreased guanylate cyclase activity observed in these cells. These results do not appear to support the suggestion that cyclic GMP promotes the growth of fibroblastic cells.\n",
      "Specificity of alpha-chymotrypsin with exposed carboxyl groups blocked. The 15 exposed carboxyl groups of alpha-chymotrypsin were modified with glycine ethyl ester at low pH using barbodiimide reagent. The specificity of the modified enzyme (Chy-15) was studied over the pH range of 4 to 9 with both N-acylated and non-N-acylated amino acid esters. The modified enzyme had lower reactivity toward N-acylated esters than non-N-acylated esters compared to the native enzyme. Typical substances such as acetyl- and benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl esters retained 4 and 9% activity, whereas phenylalanine ethyl ester was slightly more reactive with the modified than with the native enzyme. The pH-rate profiles of acetyl-L-phenylalanine ethyl ester and tryptophan ethyl and benzyl esters were investigated in detail. Analysis of these profiles revealed three pKa values of approximately 5, 7, and 9 related to a functional carboxyl, imidazoyl, and an amino group, respectively. Since similar pKa values occur for the native enzyme, modification did not block the carboxyl corresponding to pKa 5. A mechanism is proposed for catalysis which includes both the protonated and unprotonated form of the imidazoyl (His-57) and utilizes water rather than a carboxyl (Asp-102) as the proton sink.\n",
      "Evidence for the coordinate control of activity of liver glycogen synthase and phosphorylase by a single protein phosphatase. Homogeneous rabbit liver phosphorylase phosphatase (Brandt, H., Capulong, Z. L., and Lee, E. Y. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8038-8044) also dephosphorylates glycogen synthase b. During purification, phosphorylase phosphatase and glycogen synthase phosphatase co-purified with a constant ratio of activities. The two activities co-migrated on disc gel electrophoresis. Both substrates competed with each other for the phosphatase, and both phosphatase activities were inhibited by lysine ethyl ester. It is concluded that liver phosphorylase phosphatase and glycogen synthase phosphatase have a common identity and that coordinate regulation of the phosphatase-catalyzed activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of phosphorylase occurs in vivo. This provides a parallel and opposing mechanism to that mediated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, which coordinately inactivates glycogen synthase and, via phosphorylase kinase, activates phosphorylase. Maximal glycogen synthase phosphatase activity was observed near neutrality. Mg2+ and glucose-6-P activated the glycogen synthase phosphatase reaction and this activation was pH-dependent. The Km for glycogen synthase b was 0.12 muM.\n",
      "Solubilization and characterization of the beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites of frog erythrocytes. Specific beta-adrenergic receptors present in membrane preparations of frog erythrocytes were identified by binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, a potent competitive beta-adrenergic antagonist. The (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites could be solubilized by treatment of a purified erythrocyte membrane fraction with the plant glycoside digitonin but not by treatment with a wide variety of other detergents. The binding sites appeared to be soluble by several independent experimental criteria including (a) failure to sediment of 105,000 X g for 2 hours; (b) passage through 0.22-mu Millipore filters; (c) chromatography on Sepharose 6B gels; and (d) electron microscopy. The soluble receptor sites retained all of the essential characteristics of the membrane-bound sites, namely rapid and reversible binding of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists; strict stereospecificity toward both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists; appropriate structure-activity relationships; saturability of the sites at low concentrations of ligand; no affinity for alpha-adrenergic drugs, nonphysiologically active catechol compounds, and catecholamine metabolites. Based on gel chromatography in the presence of detergent, the molecular weight of the soluble receptor is estimated to be no greater than 130,000 to 150,000. Equilibrium binding studies indicated a KD for the soluble receptor of 2 nM. Hill coefficients (nH) of 0.77 and curved Scatchard plots suggested the presence of negatively cooperative interactions among the solubilized receptors in agreement with previous findings with the membrane-bound sites. Kinetic studies indicated an association rate constant K1 = 3.8 X 10(6) M-1 min-1 and a reverse rate constant k2 = 2.3 X 10(-3) min-1 at 4 degrees. The kinetically derived KD (k2/k1) of 0.6 nM is in reasonable agreement with that determined by equilibrium studies. The soluble receptors were labile at temperature greater than 4 degrees but could be stabilized with high concentrations of EDTA. Guanidine hydrochloride and urea produced concentration-dependent losses of binding activity which were partially reversible upon dialysis. Trypsin and phospholipase A both degraded the soluble receptors but a variety of other proteases and phospholipases as well as DNase and RNase were without effect. Experiments with group-specific reagents indicated that free lysine, tryptophan, serine, and sulfhydryl groups may be important for receptor binding. These studies suggest that the receptor is probably a protein which requires lipids for functional integrity. Data obtained with the solubilized binding sites are consistent with the contention that these sites represent the physiologically relevant beta-adrenergic receptors which have been extracted from the membranes with full retention of their properties.\n",
      "Reconstitution and characterization of the adenine nucleotide transporter derived from bovine heart mitochondria. 1. Adenine nucleotide exchange-transport was reconstituted in vesicles prepared from phospholipids and protein fractions derived from bovine heart submitochondrial particles. The transport, which was specific for ATP and ADP was measured either as ADP/ADP, ATP/ATP, or ADP/ATP exchange. The highest specific activity (370 nanomoles of ADP/ADP exchange/min/mg of protein at room temperature) was obtained with a protein fraction prepared by cholate extraction of partly resolved submitochondrial particles followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation. 2. At 200 muM external nucleotide, the exchange reactions were inhibited by low concentrations of bongkrekate, atractyloside, and palmitoyl-CoA, with Ki values of 1.8, 3.0, and 7.5 muM, respectively. The ADP/ADP nucleotide exchange was stimulated about 5-fold by 500 muM MgCl2 or MnCl2(km of 40 muM) and about 3-fold by 500 muM CaCl2(Km of 90 muM). It was optimal between pH 6.0 and 7.0 and decreased rapidly above pH 7.5. Arrhenius plots between 0 degrees and 40 degrees showed a break point at 15 degrees with soybean phospholipids and an activation energy of 29.5 kcal/mole from 0 degrees-15 degrees and 9.0 kcal/mole from 15 degrees-40 degrees. With mitochondrial phospholipids the break point was at 9 degrees and activation energies were 42.4 kcal/mole from 0 degrees-9 degrees and 7.6 kcal/mole from 9 degrees-40 degrees. 3. The phospholipid requirements for adenine nucleotide exchange were similar to those of oxidative phosphorylation. Optimal rates were observed with a phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine ratio of 4:1. Cardiolipin had a slight stimulatory effect. 4. The uptake of ADP into vesicles containing ATP was stimulated by KCl or by KPi as well as by hexafluoracetonylacetone, and uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. The uptake of ATP into vesicles containing ADP was inhibited by KCl or by KPi, but was also stimulated by hexafluoracetonylacetone. In both cases valinomycin reversed the effects of KCl, while mersalyl or N-ethylmaleimide prevented the effects of KPi. In contrast, none of these salts nor hexafluoracetonylactone affected the ADP/ADP or ATP/ATP exchange. These findings suggest that in the reconstituted system the ADP/ATP exchange is electrogenic.\n",
      "Solubilization of thyroid peroxidase by nonionic detergents. We have examined the ability of nonionic detergents to solubilize thyroid peroxidase from a porcine thyroid particulate fraction, as measured by the release of peroxidase activity into the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 105,000 X g for 1 hour and the retardation of the supernatant peroxidase of Sepharose 6B. The parameters of peroxidase solubilization by Triton X-100 have been investigated in detail. Under optimum conditions, 60 to 95% of the thryoid peroxidase and about 50% of the total protein is released into the 105,000 X g, 1-hour supernatant. Under the optimum conditions established with Triton X-100, a series of Brij detergents of different chemical structure were equally effective in releasing peroxidase and protein. The protein patterns of the supernatants obtained with these detergents were similar on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, suggesting that the detergents studied release similar membrane proteins. The Triton X-100 and Brij 58 supernatants were chromatographed separately on Sepharose 6B equilibrated with 0.1% Triton X-100 or Brij 58, respectively. In both cases, 75 to 80% of the peroxidase activity was retarded, thereby indicating that the nonionic detergents effect solubilization of the peroxidase rather than dispersal of nonsedimentable membrane fragments. These studies report the first successful solubilization of thyroid peroxidase by nonionic detergents. Together with previous evidence from our laboratory, these experiments indicate that thyroid peroxidase is an integral membrane protein.\n",
      "Carbon 13 magnetic resonance studies of DL-2-(alpha-hydroxyethyl) thiamin and related compounds. Relation of kinetic acidity to electronic factors in thiamin catalysis. Carbon 13 NMR spectra have been obtained for aqueous solutions of DL-2-(alpha-hydroxyethyl)thiamin, DL-2-(alpha-hydroxybenzyl)thiamin, DL-2-(alpha-hydroxybenzyl)oxythiamin, and related N-3 methyl and N-3 benzyl analogs. The unusually large downfield shift of the 13C resonance of C-2 of hydroxyethylthiamin suggests that this carbon bears a partial positive charge. This result stands in contrast to results of x-ray crystallographic studies of hydroxyethylthiamin, which place a partial negative charge on C-2 (Pletcher, J., and Sax, M. (1974) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 96, 155-165). A partial positive charge on C-2 helps to explain the facility of carbanion formation at the alpha carbon both enzymatically and in model systems. The rates of proton-deuteron exchange of (C-alpha)-H with solvent deuterium, and of release of aldehyde to regenerate thiamin have been measured for hydroxyethylthiamin and analogs. The differences in kinetic acidity of (C-alpha)-H and of rates of aldehyde release are rationalized in terms of differing electron-withdrawing abilities of the substituents attached to N-3, and appear not to be related to intramolecular basic catalysis of these processes by the C-4' amino group.\n",
      "Oxygen and carbon monoxide kinetics of Glycera dibranchiata monomeric hemoglobin. Oxygen and carbon monoxide kinetics of Glycera dibranchiata monomeric hemoglobin have been studied using laser photolysis, air flash, and stopped flow techniques. The reactions of this hemoglobin with both ligands were found to be more rapid than the corresponding reactions involving myoglobin and were also biphasic in nature, the rate constants being approximately an order of magnitude different for the fast and slow phases in each case. No pH or hemoglobin concentration dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constants was apparent between pH 6 and 9 and in the concentration range of 1.25 to 40 muM heme. Both fast and slow pseudo-first order oxygen combination rate constants varied linearly with oxygen concentration between 16 and 1300 muM. A first order slow relaxation was also noted which was linearly dependent on heme concentration and inversely dependent on oxygen concentration. This reaction has been shown to be due to a replacement of oxygen by carbon monoxide. The presence of this reaction is a result of the high affinity of Glycera monomer for carbon monoxide as shown by the partition coefficient Mr = approximately 20,000 ana an equilibrium dissociation constant of the order L = 1.1 X 10(-9) M.\n",
      "Analysis of phosphate metabolites, the intracellular pH, and the state of adenosine triphosphate in intact muscle by phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra recorded from intact muophosphate, and the sugar phosphates. Quantitation of these metabolites by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance was in good agreement with values obtained by chemical analyses. The spectra obtained from various muscles showed considerable variation in their phosphorus profile. Thus, differences could be detected between (a) normal and diseased muscle; (b) vertebrates and invertebrates; (c) different species of the same animal. The time course of change in phosphate metabolites in frog muscle showed that ATP level remains unchanged until phosphocreatine is nearly depleted. Comparative studies revealed that under anaerobic conditions the Northern frog maintains its ATP content for 7 hours, while other types of amphibian, bird, and mammalian muscles begin to show an appreciable decay in ATP after 2 hours. Several lines of evidence indicated that ATP forms a complex with magnesium in the muscle water: (a) the phosphate resonances of ATP in the muscle were shifted downfield as compared to those in the alkaline earth metal-free perchloric acid extract of the muscle; (b) the coupling constants of ATP measured in various live muscles closely corresponded to those for MgATP in a solution resembling the composition of the muscle water; (c) in the muscle the gamma-phosphate group of ATP exhibited no shift change over a period of 10 hours under conditions where resonances of other phosphate compounds could be titrated. This behavior is similar to that of MgATP in model solutions in the physiological pH range, and it is different from that of CaATP. The chemical shifts of the phosphate metabolites were determined in several relevant solutions as a function of pH. Under all conditions only inorganic orthophosphate showed an invariant titration curve. From the chemical shift of inorganic phosphate observed during aging of intact muscle the intracellular pH of frog muscle was estimated to be 7.2.\n",
      "5' leads to 3'-Exonucleases of bacteriophage T4. Two enzyme activities which release nucleotides preferentially from the 5' termini of DNA were found in T4-infected Escherichia coli. Since no corresponding activities were found in uninfected cells, the activities appeared to be induced by T4. Both activities are capable of excising pyrimidine dimers from ultraviolet-irradiated DNA which has been treated with T4 endonuclease V. One of the activities , referred to as T4 exonuclease B, was purified 400-fold from an extract of T4v 1- infected cells. The enzyme initiates hydrolysis of DNA specifically at the 5' termini to yield products which are mainly oligonucleotides of varying length. The hydrolysis reaction proceeds in a limited manner. The enzyme shows optimal activity at pH 7.0 and absolutely requires Mg2+. The molecular weight of the enzyme , as estimated by gel filtration, is approximately 35,000. Another activity, referred to as T4 exonuclease C, was purified 240-fold from the extract. This activity also excises pyrimidine dimers from ultraviolet-irradiated, incised DNA and releases nucleotides at 5' termini. It has a pH optimum at 7.5 and requires Mg2+. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 20,000.\n",
      "Nuclear magnetic resonance titration curves of histidine ring protons. A direct assignment of the resonances of the active site histidine residues of ribonuclease. One of the four titrating histidine ring C-2 proton resonances of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease has been assigned to histidine residue 12. This was accomplished by a direct comparison of the rate of tritium incorporation into position C-2 of histidine 12 of S-peptide (residues 1 to 20) derived from ribonuclease S, with the rates of deuterium exchange of the four histidine C-2 proton resonances of ribonuclease S under the same experimental conditions. The same assignment was obtained by a comparison of the NMR titration curves of ribonuclease S, the noncovalent complex of S-peptide and S-protein (residues 21 to 124) with the results for the recombined complex in which position C-2 of histidine 12 was fully deuterated. The second active site histidine resonance was assigned to histidine residue 119 by consideration of the NMR titration results fro carboxymethylated histidines and 1-carboxymethylhistidine 119 ribonuclease. This assignment is a reversal of that originally reported, and has important implications for the interpretation of NMR titration data of ribonuclease.\n",
      "Nuclear magnetic resonance titration curves of histidine ring protons. Ribonuclease S-peptide and S-proteins. The histidine C-2 proton NMR titration curves of ribonuclease S-peptide (residues 1 to 20) and S-protein (residues 21 to 124) are reported. Although S-protein contains 3 histidine residues, four discrete resonances are observed to titrate. One of these arises from the equivalent histidine residues of unfolded S-protein. The variation in area of the four resonances indicate that there is a reversible pH-dependent equilibrium between the folded and unfolded forms of S-protein, with some unfolded material being present at most pH values. Two of the resonances of the folded S-protein can be assigned to 2 of the histidine residues, 48 and 105, from the close similarity of their titration curves to those in ribonuclease. These similarities indicate a homology of portions of the folded conformation of S-protein to that of ribonuclease in solution. These results indicate that the complete amino acid sequence is not required to produce a folded conformation similar to the native globular protein, and they appear to eliminate the possibility that proteins fold from their NH2 terminus during protein synthesis. The low pH inflection present in the titration curve assigned to histidine residue 48 in ribonuclease is absent from this curve in S-protein. This is consistent with our previous conclusion that this inflection arises from the interaction of histidine 48 with aspartic acid residue 14, which is also absent in S-protein. The third titrating resonance of native S-protein is assigned to the remaining histidine residue at position 119. The properties of this resonance are not identical with either of the titration curves of the active site histidine residues 12 and 119 of ribonuclease. The resonance assigned to histidine 119 is the only one significantly affected on the addition of sodium phosphate to S-protein, indicating that some degree of phosphate binding occurs. In both the absence and presence of phosphate this curve also lacks the low pH inflection observed in the histidine 119 NMR titration curve in ribonuclease. This difference presumably arise from a conformational between ribonuclease and the folded S-protein involving a carboxyl group.\n",
      "Effects of formylation of vinyl side chains of heme on optical and ligand binding properties of horse heart ferric myoglobin. Effects of substitution of vinyl groups of hemin with formyl groups on the optical and ligand binding properties of horse heart ferric myoglobin were investigated. The peak positions as well as the line shapes of the absorption spectra of the ferric derivatives of three kinds of formylmyoglobin, 2-vinyl-4-formyl-, 2-formyl-4-vinyl-, and 2,4-diformylmyoglobins depend on the number and the position of the formyl groups. Absorption maxima in the Soret region of the acid forms of these ferric formylmyoglobins in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at 20 degrees were 415.2, 422, and 429 nm, respectively. The acid forms of these formylmyoglobins exhibit absorption spectra of the mixture of high- and low spin states at ambient temperature. Since proto-, deutero- and mesomyoglobins have a high spin state under the same condition, the increase of the low spin iron in these formylmyoglobins may be due to the strong electron withdrawal by the formyl groups toward the periphery of the porphyrin ring. The affinities of these ferric formylmyoglobins and protomyoglobin for N3-, F-, OCN-, and SCN- increased in the order of proto-, monoformyl-monovinyl-, 2,4-diformyl-myoglobin, which corresponds to the increasing order of electron-withdrawing power of the porphyrin side chains. The pKa values of the acid-alkaline transition decreased in the same order. Although the ferric forms of the two isomeric monoformyl-monovinylmyoglobins exhibited different optical spectra, the dissociation constants of the complexes of these isomers for various ligands were similar to each other. The pKa values of the acid-alkaline transition were also similar. These results indicate that affinities of ferric myoglobin for ligands, in contrast to those of the ferrous form for oxygen and carbon monoxide (Sono, M., and Asakura, T. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5527-5232 and Sono, M., Smith, P.D., McCray, J.A., and Asakura, T. (1976) J. Biol. Chem 251, 1418-1426), are not affected by the position of modifications at the two vinyl groups, but are determinedby the number of the formyl groups and that two vinyl groups at position 2 and 4 are equivalent in the binding of various ligands by ferric myoglobin. The electron density of the ferric iron appears to be similar for the two isomeric monoformyl-monovinylmyoglobins.\n",
      "An essential residue at the active site of aspartate transcarbamylase. Reaction of phenylglyoxal with aspartate transcarbamylase and its isolated catalytic subunit results in complete loss of enzymatic activity. This modification reaction is markedly influenced by pH and is partially reversible upon dialysis. Carbamyl phosphate or carbamyl phosphate with succinate partially protect the catalytic subunit and the native enzyme from inactivation by phenylglyoxal. In the native enzyme complete protection from inactivation is afforded by N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate. The decrease in enzymatic activity correlates with the modification of 6 arginine residues on each aspartate transcarbamylase molecule, i.e. 1 arginine per catalytic site. The data suggest that the essential arginine is involved in the binding of carbamyl phosphate to the enzyme. Reaction of the single thiol on the catalytic chain with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol does not prevent subsequent reaction with phenylglyoxal. If N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate is used to protect the active site we find that phenylglyoxal also causes the loss of activation of ATP and inhibition by CTP. The rate of loss of heterotropic effects is exactly the same for both nucleotides indicating that the two opposite regulatory effects originate at the same location on the enzyme, or are transmitted by the same mechanism between the subunits, or both.\n",
      "Physical and kinetic properties of homogenous bovine lens aldose reductase. Aldose reductase from calf lens was purified 15,000-fold. The homogeneity of the final preparation was demonstrated by molecular sieve chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at three pH values. The monomeric nature of the enzyme is suggested by the molecular weight of 37,000 from both molecular sieve chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with beta-mercaptoethanol. This closely corresponds with a molecular weight of 40,400 estimated by using calculate physical constants in the Svedberg equation. The S20,w was 3.6 to 3.7 as determined from ultracentrifuge and sucrose density gradient data. The Stokes radius was found to be 2.5 +/- 0.2 nm and 2.75 +/- 0.15 nm by two different methods. The diffusion constant D20,w is (7.8 +/- 10(-7) +/- 0.45 X 10(-7) cm2/s). The molecule is nearly spherical as indicated by a frictional ratio f/fo = 1.14. The alpha-helical content was estimated from circular dichroism data to be 5% and did not change in the presence of added substrates, products, and some enzyme inhibitors. Homotropic cooperative effects were observed as shown by the concave downward curvature of the reciprocal plots.\n",
      "L-Asparaginase of Klebsiella aerogenes. Activation of its synthesis by glutamine synthetase. An L-asparaginase has been purified some 250-fold from extracts of Klebsiella aerogenes to near homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 141,000 as measured by gel filtration and appears to consist of four subunits of molecular weight 37,000. The enzyme has high affinity for L-asparagine, with a Km below 10(-5) M, and hydrolyzes glutamine at a 20-fold lower rate, with a Km of 10(-3) M. Interestingly, the enzyme exhibits marked gamma-glutamyltransferase activity but comparatively little beta-aspartyl-transferase activity. A mutant strain lacking this asparaginase has been isolated and grows at 1/2 to 1/3 the rate of the parent strain when asparagine is provided in the medium as the sole source of nitrogen. This strain grows as well as the wild type when the medium is supplemented with histidine or ammonia. Glutamine synthetase activates the formation of L-asparaginase. Mutants lacking glutamine synthetase fail to produce the asparaginase, and mutants with a high constitutive level of glutamine synthetase also contain the asparaginase at a high level. Thus, the formation of asparaginase is regulated in parallel with that of other enzymes capable of supplying the cell with ammonia or glutamate, such as histidase and proline oxidase. Formation of the asparaginase does not require induction by asparaginase and is not subject to catabolite repression.\n",
      "Binding and degradation of insulin by human peripheral granulocytes. Demonstration of specific receptors with high affinity. The interaction of insulin with human circulating granulocytes was studied with the use of 125I-insulin. Human granulocytes, isolated from blood by the Böyum technique, showed high insulin-degrading activity in vitro which almost obscured the presence of specific, high affinity binding sites. Degradation, measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and by binding to well characterized insulin receptors on cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9 line), was due to extracellular as well as cell-bound enzymes. Degradation was enhanced by Ca2+ and thiols and inhibited by various protease inhibitors and sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 X 10(-4) M), a serine protease inhibitor, was the most potent and inhibited 125I-insulin degradation by 80 to 90%. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide (2 X 10(-3) M), a glutathione-oxidizing reagent, inhibited degradation by 35 to 50%, possibly due to an effect on a glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase. Neither of the inhibitors affected cell viability. In the presence of inhibitors of degradation, binding sites for insulin with high affinity were detected, which by multiple criteria were true insulin receptors. Binding to these sites was rapid, saturable, and reversible with about 1000 sites/cell. The Hill coefficient for binding was 0.7, and the Scatchard plot of B/F versus B was curvilinear, due to site-site interactions of the negative cooperative type; the latter were demonstrated directly by kinetic studies. As shown previously for all other insulin receptors, binding was highly pH-dependent, and insulin analogues had affinities for these sites that closely correlated with their biological potencies.\n",
      "Triiodothyronine effects on some electrogenic properties of frog sartorius. At 21 degrees C in vitro, 0.2 and 2.0 muM of triiodothyronine (T3) produced an increase in resting membrane potential (RMP) of Rana pipens sartorius when the pH of the external solution was 7.4. The RMP was increased by 2.0 muM T3 in the presence of 10(-4) and 10(-3) M ouabain but not in 10(-3) M of 2,4 dinitrophenol. Small increases in RMP were observed with 2.0 muM T3 in solutions with low external Na. At pH 7.1 0.2 muM T3 produced a small transient increase in RMP. Membrane resistance (Rm) was found to decline gradually during exposure to 0.2 muM at a pH of 7.4. Treatment with 2.0 muM T3 at pH 7.4 was accompanied by a transient reduction in Rm. Similar transient changes in Rm were produced by 0.2 and 2.0 muM T3 at pH of 7.1 T3 reduced membrane resistance in isotonic K2SO4 and tris-buffered Mn (20 mM) solutions indicating that T3 increases potassium permeability. Direct action potentials were studied at pH 7.1. Overshoot, amplitude and rate of rise of the action potential underwent a gradual decrease in the presence of 0.2 muM T3 while thresholds remained unchanged. Thresholds were increased during exposure to 2.0 muM T3 whereas overshoot, amplitude and rate of rise underwent transient decreases followed by a return toward control levels.\n",
      "[Acute amebic abscess of the liver followed by colonic ulcers. Report  of 2 cases]. Two unusual cases of ruptured acute amebic liver abcess are presented one with inferior vena caval compression. Surgical drainage was followed by the development of colonic complications (haemorrhage and perforation) although the patients were under specific therapy. After a new surgical operation both cases were cured. The relation with amebiasis is discussed. The possibility of such an association must always be kept in mind. The value of immunofluorescence test in the diagnosis is emphasised.\n",
      "High-performance ion-pair partition chromatography of sulfa drugs. Study and optimization of chemical parameters. High-performance ion-pair partition chromatography is shown to be a versatile, efficient method for separating sulfonamides. For a group of fourteen sulfa drugs varying widely in pKA and hydrophobicity, the effect of mobile phase composition, counterion composition, pH, and ionic strength on their ion-pair partition chromatographic separation using tetrabutylammonium as the counterion and n-butanol-n-heptane as the mobile phase is shown. Wide variation in k' and a is possible by changing these parameters. Silica columns coated with buffered aqueous solutions of tetrabutylammonium sulfate resulted in efficiencies of 4000-6000 theoretical plates per 25 cm. These columns are stable for long periods of time, and can be stripped and re-used in the adsorption mode with little or no loss in efficiency. Several chromatograms are presented in order to illustrate the performance of ion-pair partition chromatography.\n",
      "Gas chromatographic determination of carboxylic acid chlorides and residual carboxylic acid precursors used in the production of some penicillins. An improved gas chromatographic method is described for the simultaneous determination of carboxylic acid chlorides and related carboxylic acids used in the production of some commercial semisynthetic penicillins. The acid chloride reacts with diethylamine to form the corresponding diethylamide. Carboxylic acid impurities are converted to trimethylsilyl esters. The two derivatives are separated and quantitated in the same chromatographic run. This method, an extension of the earlier procedure of Hishta and Bomstein (1), has been applied to the acid chlorides used to make oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and methicillin (Figure 1); it shows promise of application to other acid chlorides. The determination is more selective than the usual titration methods, which do not differentiate among acids with similar pK's. Relative standard deviations of the acid chloride determination are 1.0-2.5%. Residual carboxylic acid can be repetitively determined within a range of 0.6% absolute.\n",
      "Demonstration and some properties of cytosol-binding proteins for thyroxine and triiodothyronine in human liver. Cytosol-binding proteins for L-thyroxine (T4) and triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) were studied in human liver specimens obtained at autopsy from 5 male and 2 female subjects. The liver cytosol containing 131I-T4 or T3, together with or without added stable hormones, was fractionated by Pevikon thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 8.6, 8.0, and7.4. It was demonstrated in all the specimens that besides a small amount of serum T4-binding globulin, there existed three T4-binding proteins, termed hT4-1, hT4-2 and hT4-3, with the electrophoretic mobilities of alpha2- and beta-globulins, and two T3-binding proteins, termed hT3-1 and hT3-2, with the mobilities of gamma-globulin. Binding of hormones by the cytosol proteins was pH-dependent, and a preliminary dialysis had no effect on the hormone binding. The major band of T4, hT4-2, bound more than half the tracer T4, and possessed the maximal binding capacity of 110 mug/100 ml of 33% cytosol at pH 7.4. However, it showed no apparent affinity for T3, because the bound T4 could not be displaced with a T3 load of 600 mug/100 ml. The major band of T3, hT3-2, bound more than 70% of the tracer T3, and appeared to have a large capacity for the hormone although secondary binding sites on the same molecule might be responsible for the large capacity. The binding sites appeared almost specific for T3, because only a small, insignificant displacement was noted with a T4 load of 600 mug/100 ml. The results provide evidence for distinct binding proteins for T4 and T3 in the human liver cytosol, though their physiological roles remain to be elucidated.\n",
      "Glucagon-sensitive adenylate cyclase in human renal medulla. In cell-free preparations (washed 600 x g pellets) of human renal medulla, glucagon produced a dose-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The stimulation of renal medullary adenylate cyclase by saturating concentrations of glucagon was additive to the saturating doses of vasopressin. Furthermore, L-isoproterenol stimulated renal medullary adenylate cyclase in a dose-dependent manner, and this stimulation was blocked by DL-propranolol. Stimulation of the renal medullary adenylate cyclase by maximal doses of glucagon and L-isoproterenol was additive. DL-Propranolol did not inhibit stimulation of glucagon. Thus, the results indicate the existence of a specific adenylate cyclase that is responsive to glucagon--distinct from the isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase and the previously described vasopressin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in human renal medulla. We suggest that the renal tubular effect of glucagon may be mediated by glucagon-dependent cyclic-AMP production in renal tissue.\n",
      "Simultaneous comparison of delta 5-3beta-hydroxysteroid levels in the fetoplacental circulation of normal pregnancy in labor and not in labor. Concentrations of pregnenolone (delta5P), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 16alpha-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone (16alpha-OH DHEA), pregnenolone sulfate (delta5P-S), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were measured simultaneously by radioimmunoassay in individual, paired umbilical artery (UA) and vein (UV) sera from 18 normal term pregnancies, 6 in labor, 12 not in labor. Mean UA and UV levels +/- SEM (ng/ml) were for delta5P: 30.39 +/- 1.69, 35.55 +/- 3.06; DHEA: 12.31 +/- 2.34, 3.66 +/- 0.38; 16alpha-OH DHEA: 7.48 +/- 0.63, 10.59 +/- 0.78; delta5P-S: 1,652 +/- 154, 1,486 +/- 130; DHEA-S: 2,122 +/- 134, +/- 134, 1,906 +/- 134. Umbilical artery delta5P-S, DHEA-S, and DHEA levels were significantly higher than UV levels, whereas the reverse was true for delta5P and 16alpha-OH DHEA. The inverse arterio-venous (A-V) gradient for 16alpha-OH DHEA was contrary to previous published reports using pooled samples. Comparison by linear regression of paired UA and UV steroid concentrations of delta5P, delta5P-S, DHEA, and DHEA-S revealed a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) for each steroid. Labor was associated with a significant increase in UA levels of DHEA-S and a smaller, but not quite significant, increase in UA levels of delta5P-S, while similar changes for unconjugated delta5-3beta-hydroxysteroids were not observed. Mean A-V gradients between the group of patients in labor and those not in labor were not significantly different. These data demonstrate that: 1) a significant difference between UA and UV concentrations exists for delta5P, DHEA, 16alpha-OH DHEA, delta5P-S, and DHEA-S; 2) there is a significant correlation between UA and UV concentrations for delta5P, DHEA, delta5P-S, and DHEA-S, implying that each fetoplacental unit maintains an equilibrium relative to these steroid concentrations in the umbilical circulation; 3) labor is associated with a significant increase in UA levels of DHEA-S and probably of delta5P-S.\n",
      "Isolation of human eosinophil phospholipase D. Phospholipase D preferentially contained in human eosinophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes as compared to other leukocytes was isolated by sequential asion and cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purified eosinophil enzyme specifically liberated choline from I-alpha-phosphatidyl choline with a pH optimum of 4.5-6.0 and exhibited a pI of 5.8-6.2 on polyacrylamide-gel isoelectric focusing, which are properties shared by phospholipase D from plant sources; however, its apparent mol wt of 60,000 is approximately one-half that of the plant enzymes. Eosinophil and cabbage phospholipase D inactivated a partially purified rat platelet-activating factor (PAF) in a time- and dose-dependent reaction. The cleavage of this PAF activity was attributed to the inherent phospholipase D activity of the eosinophil enzyme since the two activities chromatographed together at each purification step, and there was apparent reciprocal inhibition of choline-generating activity by PAF and of PAF-inactivating activity by phosphatidyl choline. Thus, possible regulatory functions of the eosinophil in immediate hypersensitivity reactions include inactivation of a PAF by phospholipase D as well as degradation of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis by arylsulfatase B.\n",
      "Role of expectancy set in the systematic desensitization of speech anxiety: an extension of prior research. The influence of expectancy set with regard to therapy outcome on the effectiveness of systematic desensitization (SD) for reducing public speaking anxiety was investigated. The 7 Ss given a high expectancy set for favorable therapy outcome were informed about psychological research that indicates that SD is effective to reduce public speaking fears. SD was administered with the standard instructions to the 11 Ss given a neutral expectancy set. This expectancy manipulation did not require deception and perhaps could be used with actual SD therapy clients. As in previous research by Woy and Efran, the expectancy set manipulation significantly modified Ss' self-report of subjective perceptions of anxiety from pretreatment to posttreatment speeches, but did not affect overt behavioral or physiological indices of anxiety. Since subjective perceptions of anxiety responses are psychologically significant behaviors, these data suggest the importance of conveying a high expectation of improvement to SD and perhaps also to other types of therapy clients. SD sessions administered to small groups of clients on consecutive days, as in this study, appeared to be as effective to reduce speech anxiety as SD sessions administered to each client individually at 1-week intervals, as in the Woy and Efran study.\n",
      "Graduated approach modeling in an aversive task. Sixty female Ss were assigned randomly to six conditions that involved self-administration of electrical shock. These were: (1) no model-one trial S response; (2) no model-graduated trial S response; (3) one trial model-one trial S response; (4) one trial model-graduated S response; (5) graduated model-one trial response; and (6) graduated model-graduated response. Results indicated that graduated exposure of S to an aversive stimuli was more effective than a single such exposure and that type of exposure provided by a model had little effect.\n",
      "Cephradine excretion in humans with pH-altered urine. In a random crossover study, ten healthy men were pretreated with ammonium chloride or sodium bicarbonate to alter urinary pH, and then were given a single 1-Gm dose of cephradine, either orally or intravenously. No significant changes were found in the terminal phase rate constant nor in the time or magnitude of peak concentration. Total recovery was greater than 90 per cent whenever degradation of cephradine did not occur. An unexplained but significant reduction in area under curve was present in data for prealkalinized subjects and for all subjects who took cephradine orally. Trapping of cephradine was not significant in the excretory pathway.\n",
      "Partial agonist properties and toxicity of oral oxilorphan. Alternative pharmacologic adjuncts are needed for the management of opiate abuse. Oxilorphan, a narcotic antagonist, was studied at 5 different dose levels (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg) in 30 normal subjects to determine the relation of single oral doses and toxicity. The drug causes pupillary constriction and mild central nervous system side effects (nausea, dizziness) at all doses. Mean urine volume increased (P less than 0.05) during the 12 hours after 1 and 2 mg. Oxilorphan has partial agonist properties similar to dl-cyclazocine.\n",
      "Characteristics of the release of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate from micropipets by microiontophoresis. The transfer number for radio-labelled cyclic AMP released from microiontophoretic pipets into brain pieces was determined for a large number of samples by radioassay. Release of cyclic AMP was linearly related to both iontophoretic current intensity and time as predicted by Faraday's Law. The results revealed that cyclic AMP has a rather low transfer number. In addition, an unusually large amount of variation of release, both within and among pipets was found under a variety of times and currents. The cause of the variation is not known but could be due to the unusual structure of the cyclic AMP molecule and the fact that it must be iontophoresed as a negative ion. These characteristics of cyclic AMP release may contribute to the difficulty in obtaining positive responses from appropriate neuronal target cells in vivo.\n",
      "Effects of egg factors on cyclic nucleotide metabolism in sea urchin sperm. Cyclic AMP in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sperm was elevated approximately 2-fold by theophylline or 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Factors released from sea urchin eggs (FRE) elevated sperm cyclic AMP by about 7-fold within 1 min, and the combination of FRE with theophylline increased sperm cyclic AMP up to 100-fold within 1 min. Cyclic GMP in sea urchin sperm was slightly elevated by theophylline, but was lowered by FRE. Cyclic GMP in sperm treated with FRE plus theophylline was not higher than in sperm treated with theophylline alone. The ability of FRE-containing sea water to increase sperm cyclic AMP in the presence of theophylline was altered only slightly if at all by boiling, but it was decreased by about 50% by dialysis and destroyed by ashing. Filtration of FRE on Sephadex G-50 columns yielded two peaks of cyclic AMP-elevating activity. One peak (peak I) was eluted at the column void volume, and the other (peak II) was retained by the column. The cyclic GMP-lowering activity was located in fractions approximately corresponding to peak I of cyclic AMP-elevating activity. Dialysis of FRE-containing sea water before its application to the G-50 column virtually eliminated peak II of the cyclic AMP-elevating activity. When the cyclic AMP-elevating activity in peak I was filtered on Bio Gel A-5m columns, it also migrated at or near the column void volume. Fractions corresponding to peak I contained material that inhibited both guanylate and adenylate cyclase activities in broken cell preparations of sperm and guanylate cyclase from rat lung. The inhibitory material was stable to boiling, non-dialyzable, and destroyed by ashing. Under a variety of conditions, FRE-containing sea water or cyclic AMP-elevating peaks I or II did not stimulate sperm adenylate cyclase activity in broken cell preparations.\n",
      "Dephosphorylation of bovine casein by milk alkaline phosphatase. The pH of optimum activity of alkaline phosphatase from cow's milk depended on the substrate, being 10-1 for rho-nitrophenylphosphate, 8-6 for phosphoserine, 8-0 for phosvitin and 6-8 for casein. Individual casein components were dephosphorylated more rapidly than mixtures of alphas- and beta-caseins or of alphas-, beta-and kappa-caseins and micellar casein. Mixtures of 2 components involving kappa-casein were more readily dephosphorylated than alphas- and beta-casein mixtures. At pH 6-8, lactose, whey proteins and phosphate ions had an inhibitory effect. beta-Lactoglobulin had an inhibitory effect only when the pH of the reaction was lower than the optimum pH value of the enzyme. Mg2+ and Zn2+ were not inhibitory. The optimum conditions for dephosphorylation of casein are described.\n",
      "Effect of flurazepam on common clinical laboratory tests. Twenty-two clinical laboratory tests performed on blood samples from 16 normal subjects following one week of either flurazepam or placebo administered in a double-blind method showed no apparent chemical interference by flurazepam on any of the testing procedures.\n",
      "A kinetic concepto of lipid transport in ruminants. Summarization of the literature shows a strong correlation between dietary fatty acid intake and total lipid concentration in plasma in lactating cows whereas total milk fat secreted is related to neither of these. In the process of plasma triglyceride removal, chylomicra and very low density lipoproteins are converted to low density lipoproteins. Limited kinetic data indicate that the fractional removal rates for chulomicra and very low density lipoproteins are rapid in lactating cows whereas fractional removal of low density lipoproteins is slower, resulting in accumulation of the latter in plasma. Under such conditions, low density lipoprotein concentrations of plasma would not be expected to reflect quantitatively the transfer of plasma triglyceride fatty acids to milk fat. Quantitative analysis or triglyceride fatty acid turnover in density less than 1.006 lipoproteins should delineate the role of plasma lipid transport in milk fat synthesis. High fat diets protected from rumen biohydrogenation have proven to be a useful approach in studying ruminant fat metabolism and may be used more extensively to elucidate the role of cholesterol in plasma lipid transport and the metabolism of essential fatty acids in ruminants.\n",
      "Bovine pancreatic lipase.I.Isolation, homogeneity, and characterization. Bovine pancreatic lipase was isolated in pure form by lyophilization of fresh bovine pancreas, extraction of the enzyme with sucrose solution, fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate and acetone, followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-100. The specific activity of the purest lipase fraction was 1750 micromoles fatty acid, liberated in 30 min per milligram of protein, indicating a purification of approximately 473-fold, with an overall yield of about 42%. Homogeneity of the enzyme was confirmed by rechromatography on Sephadex G-100 as well as with the gel electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal techniques. The purified enzyme gave a typical protein ultraviolet absorption spectrum with maximum absorption at 276 nm and minimum at 252 nm. The purified enzyme exhibited a single pH optimum of 8.8 and an isoelectric point near pH 5.5. Its optimum temperature was 37 C, and its optimum substrate concentration was 10%. These properties resembled those of milk lipase.\n",
      "Distribution and removal of cadmium from milk. Distribution of added cadmium in milk systems and the feasibility of removing cadmium were investigated. In milk containing 1 ppm cadmium, 96% of the added cadmium chloride was dispersed in the skim milk fraction, and 3% was associated with the cream fraction. Cadmium was not bound strongly to any protein fraction. The association of cadmium with acid casein, whey proteins, and the fat globule membrane was 18,6, and .5% of total added cadmium. With a 5-min exposure thiosuccinylated amino-ethyl cellulose, thionitrocarboxyphenylated aminoethyl cellulose, and reduced human hair removed 72, 70, and 30%, respectively, of added cadmium in skim milk previously equilibrated for 2 h at 37 C. Increasing equilibration time beyond 24 h had no effect on removal efficiency whereas increasing pH decreased cadmium removal markedly.\n",
      "Influence of viable yogurt microflora on digestion of lactose by the rat. Laboratory rats were fed experimental diets including yogurt, pasteurized yogurt, and simulated yogurt with sucrose or lactose for 7 days followed by a single experimental meal of yogurt, pasteurized yogurt, or simulated yogurt. Assays of blood galactose demonstrated that animals fed natural yogurt containing the viable culture microflora were able to absorb galactose more efficiently. Intestinal lactase activity of yogurt-fed animals was greater than in animals fed other experimental diets including pasteurized yogurt. Gastrointestinal survival of culture organisms was demonstrated in vivo up to 3 h after feeding, and thus, the viable cells resulted in more efficient hydrolysis which favored lactose digestion in natural yogurt.\n",
      "Nonimmunologic aspects of caries resistance. A variety of components provide salivary secretions with an array of potentially effective means of combating cariogenic challenges. These defense factors range from a laissez-faire mechanical cleansing to exquisitely controlled production of highly specific antibodies. In between the two extremes are antibacterial systems whose operating characteristics are only beginning to be understood. These systems are well worth our attention. They may be the key to our understanding of variations in individual susceptibility, and could provide valuable leads for development of anticaries agents.\n",
      "Adherence of serotype e Streptococcus mutans and the inhibitory effect of Lancefield group E and S mutans type e antiserum. S mutans strain MT703 from an active carious lesion in the tooth of a child had type e specificity and showed a cross-reaction with the Lancefield group E cell wall streptococcal polysaccharide antigen. Heat-killed cells MT703 adhered to a glass surface in the presence of CGT MT703 and sucrose. Pretreatment of the cells with anti-MT703 whole cell serums inhibited adherecne. The removal of glycerol teichoic acid antibody and group E antibody from the MT703 serum did not result in a loss of inhibitory activity. Antiserum with or without adsorption significantly inhibited glucan synthesis by CGT from sucrose. Antibodies specific for the polyglycerol phosphate of teichoic acid did not inhibit adherence. Anti-group E serum and serums specific for other types of S mutans, did not show adherence inhibitory activity except for an occasional type c specific antiserum. Antibody specific for the type e antigen produced significant inhibition of the binding of CGT to the MT703 cell wall, and adherence of these cells did not occur. Antibody to CGT inhibited glucan synthesis. Treatment of the cells with dextranase, dextran antibody, or trypsin caused a significant reduction in adherence. The results suggest that the type antigen and dextran on the surface of the S mutans type e cell are functional in adherence, and that these polymers are associated with cell wall protein.\n",
      "The effect of beta adrenergic blockade on bronchial sensitivity to acetyl-beta-methacholine in normal and allergic rhinitis subjects. The effect of propranolol inhalation on sensitivity to methacholine inhalation was studied in normal and allergic rhinitis subjects to determine whether beta adrenergic blockade alters sensitivity to mediators in nonasthmatic atopic individuals. A partial beta adrenergic blockade is suggested as being instrumental in asthma. Hay fever patients studied showed similar effects and also developed asthma for the first time.\n",
      "Effect of beta adrenergic stimulation and blockade on cutaneous reactivity to histamine. It has been previously demonstrated that iontophoresis of beta adrenergic agents will alter the size of immediate hypersensitivity skin tests. It was unclear whether this alteration was due to an effect on the dermal mast cell (inhibition of histamine release) or on the cutaneous vasculature (inhibition of capillary permeability). For this reason isoproterenol, propranolol, diphenhydramine as a positive control, and saline as a negative control were iontophoresed onto the forearm of 10 atopic and 10 nonatopic adult subjects. In order to bypass histamine release from mast cells the patients were then challenged directly with histamine by the \"prick\" technique. The size of the resultant wheals was noted. The data obtained allowed the following conclusions: (1) The atopic group responded to histamine with greater wheal size than the nonatopic group. (2) Iontophoresis of diphyenhydramine effectively reduced the magnitude of the histamine wheal in both groups. (3) Isoproterenol decreased the wheal size in both groups. (4) Propranolol increased the wheal size in only the nonatopic group. (5) The successful modulation of the histamine-induced wheal and flare indicated that these drugs, regardless of their effect on the dermal mast cell, exert a measurable effect on the target organ (vasculature).\n",
      "Further observations on the potentiation of the antibacterial effect of methenamine by acetohydroxamic acid. The use of methenamine in the treatment of urinary tract infections due to Proteus species is limited by urine alkalinity. Acetohydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of urease, maintains acidity despite growth of Proteus in urine. Easily achievable concentrations of acetohydroxamic acid in vitro systems that simulated the dynamics of the urinary tract potentiated the antibacterial effect of methenamine against Proteus species. The combined use of a urease inhibitor and methenamine may be effective in the treatment of urinary infection caused by these organisms.\n",
      "Hematopoietic thymocyte precursors. I. Assay and kinetics of the appearance of progeny. A quantitative assay for the hematopoietic precursor of thymocytes has been developed. Using this assay the kinetics of appearance of the progeny of transfused bone marrow and spleen cells in the thymus of irradiated (760 R) mice has been studied. Precursor cells are seven to eightfold more common in bone marrow than in spleen and are absent from peripheral lymph nodes. They decline in number as the animals age. When hematopoietic cells are injected immediately after lethal irradiation only a small number of cells actually enter the gland. Their progeny are not detectable in the thymus for 8-12 days. The time of their detection depends both upon the size of the residual endogenous thymocyte population and the number of progenitor cells injected. Evidence has been presented that excludes thymic injury as the basis for the delay in the appearance of donor type cells and indicates that neither the production of a \"homing\" signal in the irradiated animal nor the development of precursor cells are limiting factors in the rate of thymic repopulation. These studies indicate that only an exceedingly small number (less than 100) of prothymocytes are required to repopulate the thymus of an irradiated mouse. This restricted number of progenitors must produce the entire repertory of T-cell immunologic responsiveness seen in the first weeks after repopulation.\n",
      "Frog lysozyme. I. Its identification, occurrence as isozymes, and quantitative distribution in tissues of the leopard frog, Rana pipiens. In the course of examining the etiology of the Lucké renal adenocarcinoma of the frog, Rana pipiens, it was found that organs of the normal adult contain bacteriolytic enzymes. These enzymes all satisfied the six criteria for the identification of lysozymes and at least eight forms were separable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their qualitative and quantitative distribution was organ-specific. All eight isozymes were found in normal kidney, while liver and spleen contained seven forms; skin, six; ovarian egg, five; and serum, two. In quantitative assays using a radial diffusion test, spleen had the greatest lysozyme concentration, followed in descending order by kidney, liver, skin, and ovary. Serum contained very low amounts. In terms of enzyme activity per animal, ovary was the highest ranking organ. As such a large number of lysozyme isozymes has not been reported in any other organism, their origins and functions are considered in the context of their presence in an ectotherm.\n",
      "Kinetic and pharmacological properties of the sodium channel of frog skeletal muscle. Na channels of frog skeletal muscle are studied under voltage clamp and their properties compared with those of frog myelinated nerve. A standard mathematical model is fitted to the sodium currents measured in nerve and in muscle to obtain a quantitative description of the gating kinetics. At 5 degrees C the kinetics in frog nerve and skeletal muscle are similar except that activation proceeds five times faster in nerve. Block of Na channels by saxitoxin is measured in nerve and in muscle. The apparent dissociation constants for the inhibitory complex are about 1 nM and not significantly different in nerve and muscle. Block of Na channels by external protons in muscle is found to have an apparent pKalpha of 5.33 and a voltage dependence corresponding to action of 27% of the membrane potential drop. Both values are like those for nerve. Shift of the peak sodium permeability-membrane potential curve with changes of external pH and Ca++ are found to be the same in nerve and muscle. It is concluded that Na channels of nerve and muscle are nearly the same.\n",
      "Cation transport in Escherichia coli. VIII. Potassium transport mutants. Analysis of K transport mutants indicates the existence of four separate K uptake systems in Escherichia coli K-12. A high affinity system called Kdp has a Km of 2 muM, and Vmax at 37 degrees C of 150 mumol/g min. This system is repressed by growth in high concentrations of K. Two constitutive systems, TrkA and TrkD, have Km's of 1.5 and 0.5 mM and Vmax's of 550 and 40 at 37 and 30 degrees C, respectively. Mutants lacking all three of these saturable systems take up K slowly by a process, called TrkF, whose rate of transport is linearly dependent on K concentration up to 105 mM. On the whole, each of these systems appears to function as an independent path for K uptake since the kinetics of uptake when two are present is the sum of each operating alone. This is not true for strains having both the TrkD and Kdp systems, where presence of the latter results in K uptake which saturates at a K concentration well below 0.1 mM. This result indicates some interaction between these systems so that uptake now has the affinity characteristic of the Kdp system. All transport systems are able to extrude Na during K uptake. The measurements of cell Na suggest that growing cells of E. coli have very low concentrations of Na, considerably lower than indicated by earlier studies.\n",
      "Some properties of the pyruvate carboxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens. The pyruvate carboxylase of Pseudonomas fluorescens was purified 160-fold  from cells grown on glucose at 20 degrees C. The activity of this purified enzyme was not affected by acetyl-coenzyme A or L-aspartate, but was strongly inhibited by ADP, which was competitive towards ATP. Pyruvate gave a broken double reciprocal plot, from which two apparent Km values could be determined, namely 0-08 and 0-21 mM, from the lower and the higher concentration ranges, respectively. The apparent Km for HCO3 at pH 6-9, in the presence of the manganese ATP ion (MnATP2-), was 3-1 mM. The enzyme reaction had an optimum pH value of 7-1 or 9-0 depending on the use of MnATP2- or MgATP2-, respectively, as substrate. Free Mg2+ was an activator at pH values below 9-0. The enzyme was strongly activated by monovalent cations; NH4+ and K+ were the better activators, with apparent Ka values of 0-7 and 1-6 mM, respectively. Partially purified enzymes from cells grown on glucose at 1 or 20 degrees C had the same properties, including the thermal stability. In both cases 50% of the enzyme activity was lost after pre-incubation for 10 min at 46 degrees C. The molecular weight was estimated to be about 300000 daltons by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The regulatory properties and molecular weight are thus similar to those determined for the pyruvate carboxylases from Pseudomonas citronellolis and Azotobacter vinelandii.\n",
      "Cyanide intoxication in the rat: physiological and neuropathological aspects. Sodium cyanide was given to rats by intravenous infusion at a rate that would avert apnoea (the first sign of overdosage) in the majority. There was full physiological monitoring in a group under anaesthesia and more limited monitoring in an unanaesthetized group. White matter was damaged in six animals and grey matter additionally in only one. It was concluded that cyanide can damage neurones only through the medium of secondary effects on circulation and respiration.\n",
      "Summer sequential graduate programs in nursing. In 1970 Texas Woman's University, College of Nursing instituted summer sequential programs in nursing whereby a student could study for a master's degree by attending the University for three summers. A different clinical focus was added each year from 1970 to 1973. Three sequences have been completed, i.e., clinical focuses of psychiatric-mental health nursing, medical-surgical nursing, and maternal-child nursing. Community health nursing is still in progress. Table II is a tabulation of the number and percentage of students who have entered, have withdrawn, are incomplete, or have graduated. Faculty and students think that the program is successful. Enrollment for the first summer of a three-summer sequence beginning the summer of 1974 was twenty-five students in medical-surgical nursing and fifteen students in psychiatric-mental health nursing.\n",
      "The multiple assignment: an effective alternative for laboratory experiences. The purpose of the study was to test out the efficacy of both the Traditional and the Multiple Assignment approaches to the laboratory experiences of students of nursing. The subjects were 22 students enrolled in the first quarter of an Associate Degree Nursing Program and placed in either the multiple or the traditional laboratory assignment. Results showed the students in the peer experience to be superior in overall performance on tests of Nursing Knowledge, Concept Usage and Self-Esteem. It was concluded that the Multiple Assignment approach to laboratory experiences is a viable and useful method for the education of student nurses.\n",
      "Stability of some pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes in vitamin B-6 deficient rats. The effects of lowering the liver pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) concentration by vitamin B-6 deficiency on the stability of several rat liver enzymes were examined. Three PLP-dependent enzymes (serine dehydratase, ornithine-delta-aminotransferase, and tyrosine aminotransferase) and two non-PLP-dependent enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) were induced in vitamin B-6 deficient and control rats by feeding them high-protein diets or by injecting them with glucagon or dexamethasone. The decline of each activity was followed after withdrawal of the inducer. Serine dehydratase activity declined more rapidly in vitamin B-6 deficient than in control liver; however, ornithine aminotransferase and tyrosine aminotransferase activities were equally stable in deficient and control liver. Ornithine aminotransferase was predominantly in holoenzyme form in both control and deficient rats, whereas tyrosine aminotransferase was predominantly in apoenzyme form in both groups. The proportion of serine dehydratase in apoenzyme was less stable than the holoenzyme. Activity changes of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in control and vitamin B-6 deficient rats were similar. The results suggest that differences in the stability of PLP-dependent enzymes in vitamin B-6 deficient rats depend upon differences in the proportions of these enzymes existing as holo- and apoenzyme.\n",
      "Adsorption sites of kaolin. The electrophoretic mobility and adsorptive properties of kaolin and kaolin pretreated with anionic and cationic materials were examined over a range of pH values. Pretreatment with anionic compounds had little effect on mobility, while adsorption of cationic species markedly reduced mobility. These results are explained by reference to the structure of kaolin, and the interdependence of adsorption properties and electrophoretic mobility are discussed.\n",
      "Electrode sensitive to sulfa drugs. An electrode sensitive to sulfa drugs was constructed by using the iron(II)-bathophenanthroline chelate embedded in a liquid membrane. Rapid and Nernstian responses were exhibited against solutions of sulfamerazine and sulfisomidine ranging between 10(-3) and 10(-1) M in concentration. High selectivity was observed in the presence of urea, glycine, aminopyrine, or p-amino-benzoic acid. These chemicals are known to interfere in the usual colorimetric analysis of sulfa drugs.\n",
      "Liquid-solid chromatographic determination of 6-demethylgriseofulvin in urine. A specific and quantitative liquid-solid chromatographic method for the determination of 6-demethylgriseofulvin in human urine is reported. The method consists of extraction into an organic solvent, addition of internal standard, and analysis by liquid-solid chromatography using a UV detector. Griseofulvin, if present, can be determined simultaneously. The sensitivity of the method is 6 mug/ml of urine. Total 6-demethylgrisefulvin is determined after hydrolysis of the glucuronide conjugate with glucuronidase-sulfatase enzyme solution. The method is well suited for the analysis of a large number of samples.\n",
      "Mass fragmentography of morphine: relationship between brain levels and analgesic activity. Morphine levels in rat brain were measured by the multiple ion detection method (mass fragmentography), using a computer-controlled gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer, and were correlated with the analgesic activity of the narcotic at intervals up to 6 hours after the injection. Morphine levels in brain reached a peak of 346 ng/g of tissue wet weight 30 minutes after the subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg of morphine sulfate and then declined rapidly over the next 3 hours. Between 3 and 6 hours after the injection of morphine, the brain concentration decreased slightly but was still readily detectable at 6 hours after injection. An excellent correlation (r = 0.923) was found between the concentration of morphine in brain and analgesic activity, as measured by the hot plate method. The multiple ion detection method for the measurement of morphine appears to meet all of the criteria necessary for any drug assay: sensitivity, specificity and ease of analysis.\n",
      "Vasoconstrictor actions of delta8- and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the rat. Cardiovascular effects of delta8- and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were studied after systemic intravenous administration and intra-arterial administration into a perfused vascular bed in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Intravenous administration of delta8- and delta9-THC produced dose-related transient increases in blood pressure followed by more prolonged hypotensive responses and bradycardia. Intra-arterial administration of delta8- and delta9-THC into the perfused hindquarters of the rat produced an increase in perfusion pressure indicative of vasoconstriction. The vasoconstrictor response to the cannabinoids corresponded temporally to a similar response produced by i.a. norepinephrine and was in contrast to the more prolonged vasoconstrictor responses produced by vasopressin. Phentolamine, in a dose which reduced the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine by 90%, significantly reduced the response to i.a. delta9-THC while having no effect on the actions of i.a. vasopressin. It was demonstrated that reserpine pretreatment significantly reduced vasoconstrictor actions of i.a. tyramine and delta9-THC but did not alter the responses to norepinephrine. These data suggest that delta8- and delta9-THC have peripheral vasoconstrictor activity in the rat which may be mediated, in part, through a tyramine-like action on adrenergic nerve terminals.\n",
      "Possible involvement of a transmitter different from norepinephrine in the residual responses to nerve stimulation of the cat nictitating membrane after pretreatment with reserpine. Pretreatment with reserpine (0.3 or 3 mg/kg, 24 hours before the experiment) reduced the norepinephrine (NE) levels in the medial muscle of the cat nictitating membrane to approximately 2% of the control values. Under these experimental conditions, the responses to postganglionic nerve stimulation were not abolished, reaching up to 50% of the maximum development of tension to exogenous sympathomimetic amines both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to the responses to nerve stimulation obtained in normal nictitating membranes, the residual responses to nerve stimulation obtained after pretreatment with reserpine were not blocked by phentolamine (3.1 and 31 muM) or by 0.29 muM phenoxybenzamine. The effectiveness of phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine in blocking responses to exogenous NE was the same when the normal nictitating membrane was compared to the smooth muscle obtained from cats pretreated with reserpine. The residual responses to nerve stimulation were reduced when the calcium concentration in the medium was decreased to 0.65 mM. These residual responses were abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Scopolamine, 0.078 muM, did not reduce the residual responses to nerve stimulation while it antagonized the responses to exogenous acetylcholine, indicating that a cholinergic mechanism is not involved in this phenomenon. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphosphate (ADP) behaved as agonists on the smooth muscle of the normal and of the reserpine-pretreated nictitating membrane and the responses to ATP were not blocked by phentolamine. It is concluded that the residual responses to nerve stimulation obtained after pretreatment with reserpine could be due to the release of a transmitter different from NE. The possibility that ATP or ADP might be involved in these residual responses to nerve stimulation is discussed.\n",
      "Pineal beta adrenergic receptor: correlation of binding of 3H-l-alprenolol with stimulation of adenylate cyclase. 3H-l-Alprenolol, a potent competitive beta adrenergic antagonist, binds to sites in rat pineal gland membranes. The properties of these binding sites were compared to those of the receptors which mediate the beta adrenergic activation of pineal adenylate cyclase. Both sites are highly stereospecific. The l-stereoisomers of alprenolol and propranolol were at least two orders of magnitude more potent than the d-stereoisomers in inhibiting isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase or 3H-l-alprenolol binding. The dissociation constants (Kd) of the l-stereoisomers of both alprenolol and propranolol were 10 to 22 nM as determined by competition for binding sites or by inhibition of isoproternol-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Beta adrenergic agonists which stimulated adenylate cyclase also competitively inhibited the binding of 3H-l-alprenolol. They showed the same order of potency (isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to epinephrine) and the same individual affinities in the two systems. Alpha adrenergic blockers were ineffective in inhibiting either adenylate cyclase stimulation or 3H-l-alprenolol binding. Isoproternol stimulation of adenylate cyclase acrivity, and 3H-l-alprenolol binding, were rapid and rapidly reversible. The 3H-l-alprenolol binding sites were saturable and bound 0.6 pmol of ligand per mg of added protein. The data suggest that the binding of 3H-l-alprenolol occurs at sites indistinguishable from the pineal beta adrenergic receptor.\n",
      "A pharmacological analysis of neurally induced inhibition of carotid body chemoreceptor activity in cats. Experiments were performed to determine the mechanism by which centrifugal impulses in the carotid sinus nerve (CSN) reduce the frequency of impulse traffic in afferent chemoreceptor fibers from the carotid body in cats. Recordings of chemoreceptor activity were made from single- or few-fiber preparations dissected off the CSN, while the remainder of the CSN was stimulated electrically to produce neurally induced inhibition of chemoreceptor activity. Various drugs were injected either intravenously or directly into the arterial blood supply to the carotid body. We found that catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine) inhibited spontaneous chemoreceptor activity, and that alpha adrenergic antagonists abolished both this inhibition and that produced by electrical stimulation of the CSN in the same preparation. Atropine, but not nicotinic antagonists of acetylcholine, consistently blocked neurally induced inhibition but not that produced by catecholamines. Muscarinic agonists had no effect on spontaneous chemoreceptor activity. We conclude that centrifugal activity in the CSN causes release of endogenous catecholamines in the carotid body, and that these catecholamines mediate neurally induced inhibition of chemoreceptor activity is due to the vasomotor effects of acetylcholine.\n",
      "On the ability of narcotic antagonists to produce the narcotic cue. The ability of narcotic antagonists to produce the narcotic cue was investigated in rats trained to discriminate fentanyl (0.04 mg/kg) from solvent. The partial antagonists pentazocine, cyclazocine and nalorphine were found to possess narcotic cuing activity whereas naloxone lacked any such action at doses up to 160 mg/kg. The relationship between the present findings and the ability of these drugs to produce opiate-like subjective effects in humans is discussed. The conclusion was reached that the experimental procedure used may contribute significantly to the preclinical evaluation of drug abuse liability.\n",
      "Effect of para-aminohippurate on renal glutamine metabolism in the rat. After para-aminohippurate (PAH) infusion into rats, urine pH decreased and urine ammonium excretion increased. Because augmented urine flow and decreased urine pH could not explain entirely the enhanced ammonium excretion, an increased ammonia production was postulated as a contributing influence. This was supported by the in vitro findings that PAH could increase slice ammoniagenesis from glutamine. The ability of PAH to stimulate ammoniagenesis in vitro was attributed to enhanced phosphate-dependent glutaminase activity. We conclude that PAH infusions at certain concentrations in vivo can alter ammonium excretion through increased renal ammonia production. The latter may be secondary to enhanced phosphate-dependent glutaminase activity.\n",
      "Inhibition by sulfobromophthalein of mitochondrial translocation of anions and adenine nucleotides: effects upon liver adenosine triphosphate and possible correlation with inhibition of bile flow in the rat. Unconjugated sulfobromophthalein (BSP) inhibits state III respiration of rat liver mitochondria. It competitively inhibits the translocation into mitochondria of citrate, malate, phosphate and adenosine diphosphate, as studied by the inhibitor stop method. A double-beam spectrophotometric study strongly suggests that glutamate translocation is similarly inhibited. After perfusion of 65 mumol/hr/100 g for 90 minutes, bile flow is inhibited by 82% and liver adenosine triphosphate (ATP) falls by 60%. The amount of mitochondrial BSP can be computed form the amount of [35S] BSP still bound to mitochondria that are prepared at the end of such experiments; the amount of BSP lost during the isolation procedure is estimated from parallel experiments following binding of BSP in vitro. Comparison of the kinetic constants of mitochondrial transport and of their inhibition by BSP on the one hand and of liver concentration of substrates and BSP on the other gives rise to the conclusion that a strong inhibition of transports, mainly of phosphate, occurs in vivo and is responsible for the concomitant decrease in bile flow.\n",
      "Dissociation constants and relative efficacies of agonists acting on alpha adrenergic receptors in rabbit aorta. The dissociation constants (KA values) of l-norepinephrine (l-NE) and seven other agonists acting on alpha adrenergic receptors in rabbit aorta strips were determined by analysis of concentration-response data before and after fractional inactivation of receptors with Dibenamine. In experiments to determine KA values, propranolol was added to block activation of beta receptors and cocaine to block the neuronal uptake mechanism. The KA of l-NE and the KA of a second agonist, when determined on paired strips from the same aorta, were used to calculate the relative affinity and the relative efficacy (er) of the second agonist as compared to l-NE. The validity of the method used for determining KA and er values was supported by the following findings. 1) The dissociation constant (KB) of the competitive antagonist, phentolamine, determined with each of the agonists, was the same as that determined with l-NE. 2) The KA determined for l-NE was independent of the fraction of active receptors remaining (q) after pretreatment with different concentrations of Dibenamine. 3) The KB of phentolamine determined with l-NE as the agonist was the same before and after fractional inactivation of receptors. 4) After inactivation in paired strips by equal exposures to Dibenamine, the q value determined with each agonist was the same as that determined with l-NE. The mean KA value for l-NE was 3.39 +/- 0.15 X 10(-7) M. The mean relative affinities of the agonists for the alpha receptor were: l-NE, 1;L-EPINEPHRINE, 1.25; L-PHENYLEPHRINE, 0.200; L-norphenylephrine, 0.217; epinine, 0.136; dopamine, 0.0055; l-alpha-methylnorepinephrine, 0.095; dl-alpha-ethylnorepinephrine, 0.0048. The mean er of each agonist was not significantly different from that of l-NE, except for l-norphenylephrine with an e of 0.71, and dl-alpha-ethylnorepinephrine with an er of 0.41. The results are discussed from the standpoint of structure-activity relationships.\n",
      "The effect of carbon dioxide on the intracellular pH and buffering power of snail neurones. 1. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured using pH-sensitive glass micro-electrodes. The effects on pHi of CO2 applied externally and HCO3-, H+ and NH4+ injected iontophoretically, were investigated. 2. The transport numbers for iontophoretic injection into aqueous micro-droples were found by potentiometric titration to be 0-3 for HCO3- and 0-94 for H+. 3. Exposure to Ringer, pH 7-5, equilibrated with 2-2% CO2 caused a rapid, but only transient, fall in pHi. Within 1 or 2 min pHi began to return exponentially to normal, with a time constant of about 5 min. 4. When external CO2 was removed, pHi rapidly increased, and then slowly returned to normal. The pHi changes with CO2 application or removal gave a calculated intracellular buffer value of about 30 m-equiv H+/pH unit per litre. 5. Injection of HCO3- caused a rise in pHi very similar to that seen on removal of external CO2. 6. The pHi responses to CO2 application, CO2 removal and HCO3- injection were slowed by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide. 7. H+ injection caused a transient fall in pHi. In CO2 Ringer pHi fell less and recovered faster than in CO2-free Ringer. Calculation of the internal buffer value from the pHi responses to H+ and HCO3- injection gave very similar values. 8. The internal buffer value (measured by H+ injection) was greatly increased by exposure to CO2 Ringer. Acetazolamide reduced this effect of CO2, suggesting that the function of intracellular carbonic anhydrase may be to maximize the internal buffering power in CO2. 9. It was concluded that the internal HCO3- was determined primarily by the CO2 level and pHi, that internal HCO3- made a large contribution to the buffering power, and that after internal acidfication pHi was restored to normal by active transport of H+, OH- or HCO3- across the cell membrane. The active transport was much faster in CO2 than in CO2-free Ringer.\n",
      "[Blood acid-base changes produced by variations of water oxygenation in the crab Carcinus maenas (author's transl)]. 10 Blood acid-base changes were studied at 17 degrees C in immersed crabs (Carcinus maenas) exposed to hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions, by measuring the pH and the CO2 partial pressure, PbCO2, and by calculating the bicarbonate concentration. 20 Hyperoxia first induces a marked respiratory acidosis with a rise of PbCO2. This acidosis is compensated thereafter by a non-ventilatory increase of the blood buffer base concentration. These results are discussed in relation to the general problems concerning the control of the blood acid-base balance in aquatic animals.\n",

A study was made of the acid-base status of Babesia canis infected dogs judged unlikely to recover after specific babesicidal drug therapy despite the use of blood transfusion and other conventional supportive measures. Such cases were invariably acidotic and responded well and often dramatically to supportive intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration. Elevated blood urea nitrogen, also responded gratifyingly to this procedure. The rationale is discussed in some detail.\n",
      "Regulation of cell volume and ion concentrations in a Halobacterium. Changes in cell volume and ion content of a Halobacterium species are described in terms of the NaCl concentration (0.5--3.5M) and pH(4-8) of the suspending medium. Cell volume, per unit content of protein of bacteria in stationary phase cultures, rose as the [NaCl] of the growth medium was increased. Logarithmic-phase bacteria shrank as the pH fell from 7 to 5.5. These changes are characteristic of bacteria with a moderate or rapid rate of O2 consumption. Starving (i.e. nonmetabolizing) bacteria, on the other hand, did not change in size within the above ranges of [NaCl] and pH. At lower values, however, such bacteria swelled and eventually lysed. Effects of low pH on cell ions are compared in metabolizing and starving bacteria, and it is shown that changes in the state of the cell K are correlated with movements of cell Na. It appears that the cell K is used to maintain cell [Na] below the NaCl concentration of the medium. The results are explained in terms of a model involving interactions between polyelectrolytes, salts and water in the concentrated cytoplasm of these halophilic organisms.\n",
      "Behavioral and psychodynamic dimensions of the new sex therapy. The new sexual therapy, a brief outpatient treatment of sexual dysfunction consisting of structured sexual exercises and conjoint therapeutic sessions, is a systematic intergration of behavioral and psychodynamic elements. Formally consisting of many defining characteristics of a behavior therapy including the direct treatment of a specified problem and the application of behavioral principles, the new sex therapy also relies on psychodynamic understanding. The result is synergistic. Psychodynamic understanding underlies appropriate behavioral intervention, and psychodynamic exploration of resistance enhances the effectiveness of behavioral methods. Behavioral techniques facilitate the most rapid implementation of therapeutic insight. The integration of approaches in the new sex therapy has general significance for psychotherapeutic theory and practice.\n",
      "The use of microchemical techniques for the identification of new transmitter molecules in neurons. The author reviews available microtechniques and results on cellular analysis of single neurons emphasizing the identification of putative neurotransmitter molecules. Highly sensitive microquantitative methods for identification and assay of known and putative neurotransmitters have been developed within the last 15 years. Several of the methods reported in the article fulfill the requirements of both specificity and sensitivity for exploring and measuring the level of transmitter molecules in single neurons. Some of the available techniques, mostly those which associate GC or TLC with MS, have been able to unambiguously demonstrate the presence of putative neurotransmitter molecules, or at least of substances which are strongly suspected of fulfilling a functional role in the nervous system.\n",
      "Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. V. The inhibitory activity of normal vaginal fluid on Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Normal vaginal fluid from premenopausal volunteers was inoculated with 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at pH's of 4.3, 4.6 and 4.9. All bacteria were killed at pH 4.3. Nine of 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 12 of 14 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at pH 4.6. Only 4 of 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at pH 4.9, while 8 of 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis were killed at the same pH. We conclude that in comparison to the common 0 group strains of Escherichia coli, vaginal fluid is more bactericidal to Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and that these observations may help explain the relative infrequency of bacteriuria owing to the organisms.\n",

      "Studies on the mode of antagonism between adrenergic beta-mimetics and beta-blocking agents (II). Analysis by the uptake saturation model. Curves of experimentally plotted log (dose ratio-1) vs.-log [B] for the antagonism between adrenergic beta-mimetics, isoproterenol (ISO) and trimetoquinol (TMQ), and various beta-antagonists in relaxation of guinea-pig trachea could not be reasonably fitted to Schild's equation which has been commonly used in the analysis of drug-antagonism. Taking into consideration the saturable uptake process of the drug used herein, the equation presented in this paper fitted fairly well to the experimental curves and explains the following results: 1, TMQ was more strongly antagonized than ISO by all the blocking agents tested, that is, the apparent modes of antagonism were different between ISO and TMQ although they are considered to interact with the same receptor site. 2, The slope of the curve for a given antagonist markedly differed between ISO and TMQ. It is hypothesized that ISO is more easily taken up than TMQ. This was experimentally confirmed: i.e., ISO was potentiated about 8 fold by inhibiting the uptake process with dibenamine while TMQ was not. By pretreatment with dibenamine, the log (dose ratio-1) vs.-log [B] curve for the ISO-propranolol antagonism was shifted upward and superimposed with the theoretical curve of antagonism in which uptake of the agonist was neglected.\n",

The progressive changes in pH, lactate content, and light and electron microscopic appearances were studied in dog myocardium undergoing a 6-hour period of autolysis in vitro at 37 degrees C. and at room temperature. At 37 degrees C. there was a rapid cumulative fall in pH during the 1st hour after excision of the heart and a corresponding increase in lactate content, but little additional change in either subsequently. The nature and sequence of the morphologic alterations at this temperature were generally similar to those which occur in ischemic myocardium in vivo. At room temperature, a much slower cumulative decrease in pH and increase in lactate content took place throughout the whole period of investigation and was paralleled by a slower rate of development of morphologic change.\n",

      "Proteins of the hepatoma tissue culture cell plasma membrane. The specificity of lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination for the proteins of the hepatoma tissue culture cell plasma membrane was examined by histochemical, biochemical, and cell fractionation techniques. Light microscope autoradiography of sectioned cells shows the incorporated label to be localized primarily at the periphery of the cell. Most of this label can be released from the cell by trypsin but not by collagenase or hyaluronidase. The label is recovered from the cells as either monoiodotyrosine or diiodotyrosine after hydrolysis of cell extracts with a mixture of proteolytic enzymes. The label co-purifies during cell fractionation with an authentic liver cell plasma membrane marker enzyme, 5'-nucleotidase. Thus, the incorporated iodide is itself a valid marker for those membrane polypeptides having tyrosine residues accessible to the lactoperoxidase. The polypeptide complexity of the purified plasma membrane was examined by high resolution dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At least 50 polypeptides in the membrane are accessible to iodination. These polypeptides probably represent the bulk of the protein mass of the membrane and iodinating them does not affect cell viability, growth rate, or cell function. Labeling experiments with fucose and glucosamine show that at least nine of the iodinated peptides may be glycoproteins.\n",

      "Preliminary characterization of the acetylcholine receptor in human erythrocytes. The response of human erythrocytes to cholinergic ligands was studied with an electron spin resonance assay. The membrane response to carbamyl choline was found to be antagonized by atropine and, in the absence of calcium, by tetrodotoxin. Experiments with resealed ghosts showed that the membrane response to carbamyl choline required ATP and calcium. Reductive alkylation of intact cells eliminated the cholinergic response, but the presence of saturating amounts of carbamyl choline protected the putative receptor against inactivation. Affinity labeling was used to demonstrate an apparent molecular weight of 41,000 for the carbamyl choline-binding species. A lipid vesicle extraction technique was used to induce a specific cation permeability defect in intact cells. Preliminary investigation of this phenomenon is described.\n",

The effects of prior opportunities to drink alcohol solutions on the subsequent production of conditioned taste aversion by the oral ingestion of alcohol were evaluated. The consumption of 5 and 7% alcohol solutions produced conditioned aversion; the consumption of 3% alcohol solution did not result in aversion. Prior exposure to alcohol did not alter the extent of the aversion.\n",

      "Estimated U.S. alcoholic beverage consumption, 1790-1860. From 1790 to 1830 American consumption of alcoholic beverages generally rose, with an increased use of spirits, a high but declining consumption of hard cider, and a negligible intake of wine and beer. Intake of absolute alcohol peaked in 1830, at a rate twice that estimated for 1970. From 1830 to 1860 consumption fell sharply, but since 1860 consumption has fluctuated much less.\n",

      "Effect of narcotic analgesics on the striatal homovanillic acid content in mice; relation to antinociceptive effect. The effects of various narcotic analgesics on striatal homovanillic acid (HVA) content, hot plate time and rectal temperature in mice were compared in relation to dose and time. The hypothermia induced by narcotic analgesics did not correlate with the striat\"al HVA increase. Pentazocine, cyclazocine and thebaine had no effect on the hot plate time. The maximum prolongation of hot plate time induced by morphine, methadone or piminodine occurred before the highest HVA increase. The highest increase induced by narcotic analgesics in striatal HVA content was twice the original concentration. This occurred 2 hr after 40 mg/kg of morphine; 2 hr after 20 mg/kg of methadone; 1/2 hr after 20 mg/kg of piminodine; and 1 hr after 60 mg/kg of pentazocine. Cyclacozine (10 and 20 mg/kg) and thebaine (10 mg/kg) did not alter the HVA content. With the exception of pentazocine, those doses of narcotic analgesics that caused equal increases in striatal HVA content were also equianalgesic. These results suggest that there are similarities in the structural requirements for antinociceptive and striatal HVA-increasing effects of narcotic analgesics. The neuroleptic compound haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) caused a fourfold increase in striatal HVA content making it twice as efficient as narcotic analgesics. This finding suggests that narcotic analgesics do not act on the same sites as neuroleptics when causing an increase in striatal HVA content.\n",
      "The role of new health practitioners in a prepaid group practice: provider differences in process and outcomes of medical care. Practice patterns and patient-reported outcomes of care are compared in detail for ten physicians and 12 new health practitioners delivering ambulatory care in two departments of a prepaid group practice, the Columbia Medical Plan (CMP). All providers completed questionnaires for a 50 per cent random sample of patients seen during a two-week period. Patients completed questionnaires prior to receiving care and were interviewed one week and one month after their clinic visits. New health practitioners deliver approximately 75 per cent of well-person care, 56 per cent of problem-oriented care in adult medicine, and 29 per cent of problem care in pediatrics. They have become increasingly involved over time in the treatment of acute conditions and injuries while physicians have retained their predominant role in treating patients with chronic conditions. Thirty-two per cent of visits with new healh providers involved a physician in one or more of the following: decision-making, direct supervision, consultation, or seeing the patient as a second provider of care. Degree of autonomy varied by type of task performed, category of problem treated, and specialty. The following outcomes of care were examined by type of provider: patient-reported change in problem status,including frequency and intensity of pain or discomfort, level of anxiety, and degree of activity limitation; the degree to which physician-specified criteria for the most commonly occurring conditions were met with respect to change in problem status; and patient satisfaction with a number of dimensions of the clinic visit. The analysis suggests that the new health practitioners at the CMP are providing care, within their areas of responsibility, of comparable quality to that delivered by physicians.\n",
      "Communication patterns of doctors and their assistants. Communication patterns between physicians and their assistants (Medex) were observed in 19 practices to describe and evaluated the nature of their relationship. Observations demonstrated that interaction around patient problems was approximately 30 minures per day and informal, with the Medex more often initiating the contact. Medex were more likely to ask for, and physicians were more likely to give, suggestions. Physicians appeared to regard the accomplishment of the immediate task as more important than maintaining good relations. In most practices, supervision was available when requested. Generally, both the physician and the Medex show a striking similarity in communication styles.\n",
      "Sterol synthesis in the liver, intestine, and lung of the guinea pig. The relative rates of sterol synthesis in the liver, ileum, and lung of the guinea pig have been studied by measuring the incorporation by tissue slices of 14C-labeled acetate into digitonin-precipitable sterols. The liver showed maximum incorporation of acetate at pH 6.5, the ileum at pH 7.5, and the lung at pH 6.0. The incorporation of acetate approached the maximum rate at a concentration of 10 mM with the liver and lung and 5 mM with the ileum. Using these conditions of assay, sterol synthesis was measured in the liver, ileum, and lung of four groups of guinea pigs killed at 6-hourly intervals. Depending on the time of day, the rate of sterol synthesis in the ileum was from 6 to 14 times that in the liver, while in the lung the rate was up to 3 times that shown by the liver, Additional studies showed that all regions of the small intestine synthesized sterol at a higher rate than the liver, with the highest rate of synthesis occurring in the ileum. The rates observed in the adrenal, testis, muscle, adipose tissue, and skin indicated that these tissues are not quantitatively important sites of sterol synthesis in the guinea pig.\n",
      "Autoregulatory system of insulin degradation in liver. II. Relationship between blood insulin levels and GSH-dependent insulin degrading activity in liver and blood. An autoregulatory system of insulin degradation in the liver in which the rate of insulin metabolism changes in response to fluctuation in its blood levels, was investigated. In the plasma of rats and man in the absence of reduced glutathione (GSH), insulin degradation was not observed, but when a sufficient amount of reduced glutathione was added, the plasma did degrade insulin. This GSH-dependent insulin degrading activity in plasma was quite similar to that in liver in its nature. In rats, this GSH-dependent insulin degrading activity in the liver and plasma was fluctuated in  response to fluctuation in the blood insulin levels, and the GSH-dependent insulin degrading activity in plasma was well correlated with that in the liver. Similarly, in man the GSH-dependent insulin degrading activity in plasma was changed in response to fluctuation in the blood insulin levels. In plasma under the physiologic conditions, there is an insufficient amount of reduced glutathione to elicit the insulin degrading activity, but in the liver there is a sufficient amount of reduced glutathione to manifest this activity. This evidence further supports the concept that an autoregulatory system of insulin degradation in the liver exists in man.\n",
      "Envelope mutation promoting autolysis in Salmonella typhimurium. Two strains independently isolated in Salmonella typhimurium display abnormal autolytic activity when nutrient broth becomes alkaline. They also show increased sensitivity to deoxycholate, EDTA, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Response to acridine orange remains normal. In both strains a single stable mutation is responsible for all the changes. The same gene, called envD, appears to be involved in both mutant strains. envD has been located at minute 33 of the Salmonella genetic map, between markers sucA and nadA, very close to the latter. envD also affects morphological characteristics of the cells. Many mutant cells are shorter than wild type bacteria, and appear frequently associated in short chains of 4 to 10 cells. Furthermore, envD mutants display division by septation under conditions that preclude its observation in wild type strains.\n",
      "Ferredoxin-dependent photosynthetic reduction of nitrate and nitrite by particles of Anacystis nidulans. The dark and light reduction of nitrate and nitrite by cell-free preparations of the blue-green alga Anacystis nidulans has been investigated. The three following methods have been successfully applied to the preparation of active particulate fractions from the alga cells: (a) shaking with glass beads, (b) lysozyme treatment and lysis of the resulting protoplasts, and (c) sonication. The two enzymes of the nitrate-reducing system-namely, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase-are firmly bound to the isolated pigment-containing particles, and can be easily solubilized by prolonging the vibration or sonication time. Both enzymes-whether solubilized or bound to the particles-depend on reduced ferredoxin as the immediate electron donor. In its presence, the alga particles catalyze the gradual photoreduction of nitrate to nitrite and ammonia, a process that can thus be considered as one of the most simple and relevant examples of Photosynthesis. Some of the properties of nitrate reductase have been studied. Nitrate reductase as well as nitrite reductase are adaptive enzymes repressed by ammonia.\n",
      "Appearance of a syndrome similar to graft versus host reaction in C57 B1/6 mice bearing skin allogenic graft. A syndrome similar to GVHR is described in mice of C57B1/6 strain during the WHT/Ht skin allografts rejection period. In all the cases the described thymus involution was associated with the hypertrophy of lymph nodes. Their volume increase is due to the high number of blastic pyroninophilic and plasma cells concomitant with small lymphocytes depletion in the cortical area, and with a very pronounced hypertrophy of medullary cords by presence of a high number of plasmocytes and blastic cells. These changes have been noticed only in some animals sacrified during the first days after grafting and never later one. In agreement with the scarce data of the literature, we think that the immunocompetent passenger lymphocyte comprised in the skin grafts constitute an immunologic organ able to induce a GVHR at the beginning of the period of graft survival on the host. This GVHR, generally mild and without clinical and microscopic signs, becomes obvious only in animals which, for unknown reasons, present a low immunologic defense capacity. In these animals the described process seems to be reversible.\n",

The indirect methods include the examination of the blood (ESR, blood picture, electrolytes, especially calcium, for the exclusion of hyperparathyroidism, status of fat and liver enzymes, activity of alpha-amylase and lipase. More informative than a serum determination is the measurement of the amylase activity in the 24-hour urine. The detection of chymotrypsin in the stool can be recommended as an investigative test also for use in general practive in collaboration with a central laboratory.- The direct methods include investigation of the duodenal juice with measurement of pH, bicarbonate, of the activities of chymotrypsin, trypsin, lipase and amylase. For excluding of a disturbance of the carbohydrate metabolism in addition to blood sugar determinations, glucose tolerance and tolbutamide tests, the determination of insulin activity is indicated.\n",
      "Huntington's chorea. Changes in neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Neurotransmitter-receptor binding sites for apparent muscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin receptors were measured in the caudate nucleus and frontal cerebral cortex from post-mortem brains of 16 patients with Huntington's chorea and 16 controls. In addition, the samples were assayed for the gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and for the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase. In the caudate nucleus of choreic brain, both enzyme activities were markedly lower, with significant decreases in muscarinic cholinergic and serotonin receptor binding, whereas enzyme activities and receptor binding were unchanged in the cerebral cortex. By contrast, gamma-aminobutyric acid and beta-adrenergic receptor binding were not significantly different in choreic and control caudate nucleus or cortex, suggesting that, despite the loss of gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing ability in the corpus striatum, gamma-aminobuytric acid mimetic drugs might alleviate the movement disorders in Huntington's chorea.\n",
      "[The effect of changes in the pH of the external solution on the afterpotentials of individual frog nodes of Ranvier]. A decrease in pH to 5 elicited a small increase in afterdepolarization of a single Ranvier node and an increase in pH to 9 had no effect. Post-tetanic hyperpolarization decreases at pH 5 and its duration somewhat increases. An increase in pH to 9 also had no effect. Similar changes in afterdepolarization and post-tetanic hyperpolarization were observed in potassium free solutions. A conclusion is made that changes in afterpotentials are determined by changes in kinetics of the membrane potassium permeability.\n",
      "Prolonged clinical and experimental follow-up of hospitalized schizophrenics. 148 chronic schizophrenics admitted between 1938 and 1961 had previously been followed up. In 1972, they were re-examined, on the average 10 years after the first follow-up. 44 belonged to a series of patients studied between 1955 and 1957 with a battery of conditional reflex tests. The patients belonging to the experimental series were retested with word associations. From an experimental point of view the patients performed better over the prolonged observation period. The clinical state also showed improvement. A comparison of the chronic hospital population during 1955-57 and 1972-74 suggests that the new chronics present much less of the severe schizophrenic deterioration than the old ones. They also have remarkably better verbal functions these changes are assumed to be mainly due to drug treatment. The beneficial effects of drugs appear to come mainly within the first 2 years.\n",
      "[The state of prothrombin, plasminogen and fibrinogen in the newborn infant]. The esterase activity of thrombin and plasmin on artificial substrates was used to study the kinetics of these enzymes by Lineweaver and Burk's method. In the plasma of new-born infants, plasmin obtained from streptokinase has an avidity comparable with that in adults. Thrombin is obtained by the action of staphylocoagulase and taipan venom. Its avidity has important individual variations and is different from that in adults. An inhibitor is present both in the plasma and in the serum of the new-born. Fibrinogen was studied by variations in absorption of light during coagulation by thrombin. The abnormalities observed depend on the physical and clinical conditions of the medium (ph, osmolality). These characteristics depend on the age of the infant, but also seem to depend on the conditions of the sample and, in particular, on fibrinolytic reactions. The existence of foetal fibrinogen is discussed.\n",
      "Local renal graft-versus-host reaction: sequential ultrastructural study. A sequential study has been made of the ultrastructure of local renal graft-versus-host reactions produced in cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats by injection of either allogeneic or xenogeneic (mouse) spleen cells beneath the renal capsule. Early in the reaction, immunoblasts were seen between the outer cortical tubules, and there was associated interstitial oedema and tubular degeneration. In places, several small lymphocytes were observed clustered around and in close cytoplasmic contact with individual immunoblasts, perhaps representing interaction between donor and host cells. As the reaction proceeded, the number of lymphoid cells increased by immigration from peritubular vessels. Some tubules were invaded by lymphocytes but this was not closely related to the development of tubular injury. The reaction was maximum at one week and then decreased. Now, there was greater diversity of cells including macrophages, plasma cells and eosinophils, while many lymphoid cells became necrotic. It is concluded that most of the renal parenchymal injury is due to chemical mediators liberated from the infiltrating cells rather than to ischaemia or direct cytoplasmic interaction between leucocytes and tubular epithelium.\n",
      "Functional abnormalities in renal cystic diseases. The functions of a kidney, whether normal or cystic, can be conceptualized in terms of anatomy (glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal convolution, and collecting duct), activity (volume regulation, dilution and concentration, acid-base regulation, potassium excretion, transport of organic molecules, and calcium and phosphate excretion), and the integration of anatomic organization to meet functional demand. Our discussion of renal cystic disorders follows this conceptual outline. For discussions of normal renal physiology, the reader is referred to any one of several recent, excellent reviews (1-3). Systematic evaluation of renal function in cystic diseases of the kidney (medullary sponge kidney, medullary cystic disease, and polycystic kidney disease) has only rarely been performed. The available information suggests that the earliest detectable lesions consist primarily of tubular dysfunction. With time, however, significant reduction of glomerular filtration occurs and the resultant accumulation of uremic toxins dominates the clinical picture in polycystic and medullary cystic disease. Significant changes in glomerular function are unusual in medullary sponge kidney. This review represents an attempt to summarize the large body of literature that has accumulated on functional abnormalities in these disorders, and to point out those areas where further investigations are needed.\n",
      "Phosphate transport by isolated renal brush border vesicles. A sodium dependent specific transport system for phosphate is present in the brush border microvilli but absent from the basal-lateral plasma membranes. The apparent affinity of this transport system for phosphate is 0.08 mM at 100 mM sodium and pH 7.4. It is inhibited competitively by arsenate with an apparent inhibitor constant of 1.1 mM (100 mM sodium, pH 7.4). Sodium dependent phosphate uptake is two times higher at pH 8 compared to the uptake observed at pH 6. The apparent affinity of the transport system for sodium is also pH-dependent, half-maximal stimulation of uptake is found at pH 6 with 129 mM sodium, at pH 7.4 with 60 mM sodium and at pH 8 with 50 mM sodium. Under all conditions a nonhyperbolic dependence of phosphate uptake on the sodium concentration is observed. The uptake of phosphate by brush border microvilli vesicles shows a typical overshoot phenomenon in the presence of sodium gradient across the membrane (CNao greater than CNai). The amount of pohsphate taken up after 2 min is about twice the equilibrium value reached after 2 h of incubation. At pH 7.4 the initial rate of uptake is increased only slighyly (12%) by inside negative membrane diffusion potentials and inhibited to the same extent by inside positive membrane diffusion potentials. These results indicate that the entry of phosphate across the brush border membrane into the epithelial cell of the proximal tubule is coupled to the entry of sodium. The transfer of phosphate is dependent on its concentration gradient and on the concentration difference of sodium. The data are best explained by the following hypothesis: Both the primary phosphate as well as the secondary phosphate are transported in cotransport with sodium. The divalent form however seems to be transported preferentially. Its transport occurs electroneutral with 2 sodium ions; the monovalent phosphate also enters the cell together with 2 sodium ions but as a positively charged complex. The exit of phosphate across the contraluminal cell border is sodium independent and is favoured by the high intracellular phosphate concentration and the inside negative membrane potential.\n",
      "The effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibition on bicarbonate reabsorption. Renal reabsorption of bicarbonate was studied in Merino ewes during carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Bicarbonate reabsorption was directly proportional to plasma bicarbonate concentration. No tubular maximum for bicarbonate was demonstrated. Elevation of arterial PCO2 or depression of arterial pH caused slight increases in bicarbonate reabsorption. The data suggest that bicarbonate is reabsorbed by 2 distinct processes. The quantitatively more significant process may involve ionic reabsorption of bicarbonate secondary to Na+ reabsorption and a relatively minor part of bicarbonate reabsorption may be secondary to H+ secretion.\n",
      "Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction: pathophysiologic aspects. When the supply of substrate to the brain is threatened, homeostatic mechanisms induce cerebral vasodilatation to compensate for the insufficiency. When a region of the brain is rendered completely ischemic, local infarction occurs. The size of the infarct depends partly on the availability of collateral circulation and the adequacy of the homeostatic mechanisms controlling blood flow in stillpatent vessels. Several approaches to acute-phase treatment of stroke derive from clinical and experimental studies of cerebral blood flow and metabolism. We must conclude that both surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic measures have been of limited value in the treatment of cerebral infarction and that the basic therapy for completed stroke remains good medical management of complications and attentive nursing care.\n",
      "Pharmacologic therapy of asthma. Asthma is treated by avoiding the precipitants of symptoms, by a trial of hyposensitization (immunotherapy) if the precipitant cannot be avoided, and principally by pharmacologic therapy. Acute attacks have been most widely treated with epinephrine, but adrenergic aerosol bronchodilators and aminophylline are being used increasingly. When an acute attack of asthma does not respond to treatment, a diagnosis of status asthmaticus should be considered and the patient treated in a hospital intensive care unit because of the potentially life-threatening sequela of respiratory failure. Periodic mild episodes of asthma usually respond to administration of an oral bronchodilator. Chronic low-grade asthma is best treated with an around-the-clock regimen of theophylline. Patients whose asthma is not under satisfactory control with conventional bronchodilators may be given a trial of cromolyn sodium. Chronic severe cases may be treated with corticosteroids, but these drugs must be skillfully administered to avoid adverse effects.\n",
      "Managing acute urticaria. The physician should be familiar with preventive measures for acute urticaria or its most severe form, anaphylaxis, and with the general principles of management. Treatment does not differ basically whether given in a nonmedical setting, the emergency room, or the office, except for the availability of special supplies and equipment, such as oxygen, if needed. In all cases, a history should be obtained quickly, the patient should be examined to confirm the diagnosis, and epinephrine should be administered. Hospitalization is indicated in severe cases with systemic symptoms. Once the acute episode has been treated, the physician must decide whether further investigation is necessary. Quite often a presumptive etiologic diagnosis is made on the basis of the history. Allergy testing is not part of the routine evaluation of the patient with urticaria.\n",

      "Nephron function in acute glycerol-induced renal insufficiency in rabbits. The effect of acute experimentally induced renal failure after intramuscular injection of glycerol on serum and urine GGTP, LAP and AP activities was studied in 30 rabbits. High doses of glycerol caused shock, myolysis and hemolysis, leading to acute renal insufficiency. Serum urea and creatinine levels significantly increased, there was proteinuria, and significant decrease in 24-hr diuresis, glomerular filtration, and urinary urea excretion. The changes in LAP and AP activities were significant, and in GGTP-nonsignificant. In the urine GGTP and LAP increased significantly, and AP nonsignificantly. Urinary excretion of AP increased significantly, and GGTP and LAP nonsignificantly. The highest activity and urinary excretion of GGTP and LAP were observed on the 2nd day, and of AP--on the 5th day of renal failure.\n",
      "Angina pectoris. Diagnosis and treatment. The physician who understands the pathophysiology of angina pectoris can apply rational therapeutic measures based on an appreciation of the determinants of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Most patients with angina secondary to coronary atherosclerosis can be treated conservatively using a systematic approach that includes correction or removal of underlying causes or precipitating factors and the judicious use of sublingual nitroglycerin. In patients with more resistant angina, use of oral or topical nitroglycerin or sublingual isosorbide dinitrite as well as propranolol can be advised. Aortocoronary bypass surgery can offer significant improvement in carefully selected patients with frequent angina poorly controlled by medical therapy. The most important consideration in the treatment of angina is protection of coronary blood flow reserve by primary prevention of the atherosclerotic process itself. All individuals from families prone to coronary artery disease should be evaluated for alterable risk factors, the most important being cigarette smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Considering the high risk of unheralded sudden death in previously asymptomatic patients with coronary atherosclerosis, angina can, in a sense, be considered a fortunate harbinger of coronary stenosis, identifying candidates for secondary preventive measures aimed at retarding the progression of vascular disease. More importantly, angina serves as an index for detecting families at high risk of coronary artery disease, in whom early application of primary prevention may afford a more promising outlook.\n",

      "[Cerebral palsy--early diagnosis and treatment (author's transl)]. The main aim of the present Conference has been to debate that early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy. The Conference was attended by specialists taking care of the child with cerebral palsy (C.P.): child neurologists, surgeons--orthopedists, psychologists, rehabilitants, pediatricians. In connection with the fact that the Conference was devoted to the early diagnosis and therapy of C.P., problems concerning the lower age groups of children were debated. The Conference discussed the definitions of \"cerebral palsy\" used in the literature, the clinical forms, the auxiliary diagnostic methods and their significance in the diagnosing of this pathological syndrome. Early clinical symptoms, enabling to establish the diagnosis of cerebral palsy were particularly extensively debated. In the latter problem particular attention was paid to the diagnostic value of kinetic automatisms of the group of tonic posture reflexes and dysfunctions of the kinetic pattern in children. It was underlined in the debate the C.P. was no separate clinical disease, but a pathological syndrome arisen as a result of the negative influence of different factors and yielding very diverse clinical and neurolopathologic symptoms, according to the kind of noxious factors and the period and degree of maturity of the nervous system in which they acted. The participants in the debate also sressed that, as the child develops and is observed for a longer period it is fairly often necessary to check this diagnosis, as C.P. may prove, as the time passes, to be a degenerative syndrome, a pressure syndrome etc. The psychologists participating in the Conference discussed the psychological problems of the child with C.P. and also the early diagnosis of the pathological syndrome debated. The diversity of the symptoms of the C.N.S. in children suffering from C.P. was underscored, as--apart from dysfunctions within the kinetic area, there can be present sight, hearing and speech dysfunctions, those of sensory perceptions and mental development. These children require multispecialist care, as everyone of dysfunctions mentioned may present a complicated diagnostic problem. Plenty of place was devoted to the discussion of problems connected with epilepsy in children with C.P. Also extensively debated were the general principles of the medical procedure in children with C.P. As a result of the discussion it was decided that children with severer forms of C.P. and those from poor social conditions should be subjected to long-lasting sanatorium rehabilitation. Keeping the child in its family environment should, however, be the generally adopted principle of the rehabilitation of a little child. The parents of the child should be trained in the proper rearing of the child under household conditions, a manner to secure all the needs resulting from the then stage of its development. In connection with this problem the project of the programme of sensoric-and-kinetic rehabilitation was debated, as presented by psychologists and rehabilitants (kinesitherapeuts).\n",
      "[Congenital heart malformations in neonates, infants and young children (author's transl)]. Congenital heart malformations in neonates, infants and young children represent the main problem of paediatric cardiology in Poland. Congenital cardiovascular diseases (incidence also approximately 8 per 1000 in liveborn infants) cause very high mortality, particularly in the neonatal and infantile period. Approximately 5000 live-born children are affected every year by serious heart malformations. For at least two thirds of these previously hopelessly ill infants there are real possibilities of effective medical and surgical treatment. Not only a considerable drop in mortality in the earliest infancy would be achieved, but: a further normal physical and psychical growth and development of these children would be possible. At present, however, the available possibilities are by far not sufficient, as in all hitherto functioning centres we were able to manage 200-300 children yearly, whereas the real needs are at leasttenfold greater. Therefore it is necessary to: Increase the number and capacity of hospital wards capable enough to provide the intensive cardiopulmonary care; to execute appropriate reorganization aimed to concentrating the appropriate specialists (pediatric cardiologists, radiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses) and equipment (cardiological and cardiosurgical appliances, X-ray equipment, intensive care units etc.) in centres designated for the above tasks.

      "Activation and nuclear translocation of protein kinase during transsynaptic induction of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase. The tyrosine-3-monooxygenase activity [L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine: oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating); EC 1.14.16.2] of rat adrenal medulla is induced 20-24 hr after the injection of reserpine (16 mumol/kg intraperitoneally). This and other inducing stimuli increase the 3': 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) content in the medulla for longer than 60 min and activate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (ATP: protein phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.37) for several hours. Corticotropin (ACTH), dopamine, and propranolol do not induce the monooxygenase, but elicit an increase in the cAMP content of the medulla which fails to activate protein kinase and lasts less than 1 hr. A high- and low-molecular-weight protein kinase are separated by gel filtration from the 20,000 X g pellet extract of adrenal medulla homogenate. The activity of the low-molecular-weight enzyme is expressed as its ability to phosphorylate histone. The protein kinase activity of the pellet is increased between 3 and 17 hr after reserpine injection. Our evidence indicates that this increase is due to a translocation from cytosol to subcellular structures of a kinase that utilizes lysine-rich histone as phosphate acceptor. The protein kinase activity that is extracted from a purified nuclear fraction prepared from the adrenal medulla of rats injected 7 hr previously with reserpine is greater than that extracted from medulla of saline-treated rats.\n",
      "A 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase specific for prostaglandin A in rabbit kidney. Examination of a soluble fraction derived from homogenates of rabbit kidney papilla revealed the existence of a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase specific for A-type prostaglandins. Prostaglandins of the E- and F-series were not substrates for this enzyme. In agreement with published data, the 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase(s) derived from the kidney cortex were found to degrade all prostaglandins examined (PGE, PGF, PGA) in the presence of added cofactor NAD. Thus it is evident that in this species the kidney 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases are anatomically compartmentalized so that the papilla is able to metabpable of degrading E-, F-, and A-type prostaglandins by this metabolic pathway.\n",
      "Specific positions involved in enzyme catalyzed covalent binding of benzo[a]pyrene to poly(G). Covalent binding of benzo[a]pyrene to poly(G) was studied with the use of a radioactive assay and specifically labeled substrates to define the role of the 1, 3- and 6-positions of the hydrocarbon during this process. Binding was shown to be dependent on microsomes, NADPH, O2 and poly(G). 7, 8-Benzoflavone and 2', 2'-diethylaminoethyl-2, 2-diphenyl valerate were inhibitory w.hereas modulators of epoxide hydrase activity had little effect. 3H and 14C studies suggested a possible loss of one to two protons. Incorporation of [6-3H1]benzo[a]pyrene provided evidence that the 6-position of the hydrocarbon was not metabolized during covalent attachment to poly(G) and, furthermore, results with [1, 3, 6-3H]benzo[a]pyrene suggest that the 1- and 3-positions may not be involved either. After scaling up of the standard assay 20-fold, characterization of the tritiated BaP-poly(G) complex was carried out by hydrolysis and subsequent chromatography. Thin-layer chromatography of the isolated hydrolysis products treated with HCl or alkaline phosphatase indicated that the complex formed between BaP and poly(G) was covalently linked and composed of hydrocarbon-nucleotide(s).\n",
      "Simple model for hormone-activated adenylate cyclase systems. A simple model is developed to explain the activation of rat liver plasma membrane adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] by guanosine nucleotides and glucagon and the dependence of the cATALYTIC RATE ON Mg2+, H+, and substrate concentrations. The basic model proposes that the adenylate cyclase system can exist in two states, A and B; that activating ligands bind preferentially to the B state; and that only the B state is active. Kinetic data are quantitatively fit to this model, and the binding constants for the interaction of the A and B states with glucagon, GTP, and guanyl-5'-ylimidodiphosphate are obtinaed. The substrates ATP and adenyl-5'-ylimidodiphosphate appear to show little preference between the A and B states, and simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics are sufficient to describe the dependence of the catalytic rate on substrate concentration under optimal conditions. The dependence of the rate on pH can be explained by postulating that one ionizable group in its acid form and one ionizable group in its basic form must be present at the active site in order for catalysis to occur. The activation and inhibition of the activity by Mg2+ can be explained by a similar mechanism with Mg2+ binding to activating and inhibiting sites. Glucagon and guanosine nucleotides appear to influence the dependence of the rate on Mg2+ and glucagon. The Mg2+ also may display some preference for the B state. A comparison of this model with others that have been proposed is given. The proposed model appears to provide a simple conceptual frame-work that is applicable to many adenylate cyclase systems.\n",
      "Heat mutagenesis in bacteriophage T4: the transition pathway. G-C leads to A-T transitions are induced by heat, and arise from the deamination of cytosine (5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the case of bacteriophage T4) generating uracil. The reaction is proton-catalyzed, and is also characteristic of acid mutagenesis. Mutation rates and activation energies of mutation are site-specific, and are presumably influenced by neighboring bases. Rates of heat-induced mutation in bacteriophage T4 under conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength similar to those prevailing in higher eukaryotic cells suggest that heat mutagenesis may present a serious challenge to organisms with large genomes, and may comprise an important determinant of the rates of spontaneous mutation.\n",
      "beta-adrenergic receptors in rat liver: effects of adrenalectomy. The response of rat liver adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] to catecholamines is enhanced after adrenalectomy. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed an in vitro assay for beta-adrenergic receptors of plasma membranes derived from livers of control and adrenalectomized rats, using [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP), a potent beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Binding of IHYP reached equilibrium within 30 min and dissociation occurred with a half-time of approximately 60 min. The l-isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol were at least 50 times more potent as inhibitors of IHYP binding than were the corresponding d-isomers. Adrenalectomy did not affect the rates of association or dissociation of IHYP or the dissociation constants of several ligands that are active at beta-adrenergic receptors. The number of binding sites for IHYP was determined in homogenates and in purified membranes of livers from control and adrenalectomized rats. The number of sites increased 3- to 5-fold after adrenalectomy. A similar increase in hormone stimulation of adenylate cyclase was observed. These changes were reversed by the administration of cortisone. The increase in the number of binding sites for IHYP may be a compensatory response to the impairments in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis which occur after adrenalectomy.\n",
      "Thermodynamic studies of polymerization of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin. Solubilities of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb S), at varying pH and temperature over a range of concentrations encompassing those found in erythrocytes, were measured. The technique involved ultracentrifugation, which gave values of the supernatant concentration and the mass of the sedimented material. The data establish that the solubility of doexy-Hb S is the saturation concentration and is independent of initial concentration. The mass of the pellet phase increases linearly with initial concentration. Moreover, the saturation concentration represents the critical concentration above which monomers are in equilibrium with polymers. These polymers are the putative cause of erythrocytes deformation associated with sickle cell anemia. The solubility-pH profiles of deoxy-Hb S at various temperatures, unlike those of other proteins, show no minima at the isoelectric pH but instead show a marked decrease in solubility below pH 7.0, indicating the predominance of polymerization over the expected increase in solubility. Deoxy-Hb S, within specified ranges of temperature and pH, possesses a negative temperature coefficient of solubility, a property characteristic of hydrophobic interactions. The saturation concentration is, however, temperature independent at conditions close to physiological. The enthalpy of polymerization (3.5 kcal/mol) is temperature independent from 6 degrees to 22 degrees for all pH values between 6.45 and 7.40. In the range of 22 degrees to 38 degrees, this parameter becomes less endothermic, having a value of 2.5 kcal/mol at pH 6.45 and a value of zero at pH 7.20. Such behavior of the system suggests a phase transition near 22 degreas. Within the range of conditions examined the polymerization is entropically driven.\n",
      "Difference in the number of insulin binding sites between cortisol-sensitive and cortisol-resistant lymphoma P1798 cells. Cortisol-sensitive and cortisol-resistant lymphoma P1798 cells specifically bind [25I]insulin. Resistant lymphocytes bind 40% less insulin than sensitive cells. These results suggest that insulin (or insulin-like substances) may play a role in growth regulation and/or response of this tumor to glucocorticoid therapy.\n",
      "Action of histamine and its receptor blockers on uterine circulation in sheep. Effects of iv and ia administration of histamine and its H1 and H2 blockers (diphenhydramine and metiamide) on systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, and uterine and iliac blood flows were investigated in unanesthetized, chronically instrumented nonpregnant ewes. Intravenous histamine produced tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased iliac and uterine blood flows. In contrast, ia injections produced a significant increase in blood flows in these vascular beds which was dose-dependent. Evidence is presented to show that some of the circulatory actions of histamine may be related to stimulation of H1 while others may be related to H2 receptors. The peripheral circulatory action produced by iv histamine is probably secondary to its effects on reducing cardiac output. The uterine and iliac vascular beds contain mostly H1 receptors since their response to histamine can be blocked almost totally by Benadryl and not by H2 antagonist metiamide.\n",
      "Alpha-MSH and MIF-2 effects on serotonin levels and accumulation in various rat brain areas. Levels as well as accumulation of serotonin (5-HT) were measured in various brain regions of the rat after administration of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (MIF-I). The method used in determining the serotonin measured both 5-OH-tryptamine (5-HT) and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT). No statistically significant changes in levels or accumulation of serotonin after pargyline injection were found when unoperated control rats were treated with either MSH or MIF-I. Similar treatment of hypophysectomized rats indicated that both peptides significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered serotonin accumulation only in the area of the frontal cortex; a similar but smaller, not statistically significant, decrease was seen in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of the hypophysectomized rat. Since only hypophysectomized rats were affected, no correlation between the behavioral effects of these peptides (which has been found to occur in both unoperated and hypophysectomized rats) and the biochemical changes could be made.\n",
      "Alpha-MSH and MIF-I effects on catecholamine levels and synthesis in various rat brain areas. Attempts were made to find a biochemical correlate with previously observed behavioral alterations after administration of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and MSH release-inhibiting factor (MIF-I). Brains of intact and hypophysectomized (hypox) rats were analyzed for endogenous catecholamine levels and the disappearance rate of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) after treatment with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT). The studies undertaken show the following: (1) After the injection of MSH (100 mug/kg IP daily x 3) and AMPT, samples in different groups of intact and hypox rats were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hrs in 7 different brain areas. In the mid-brain area for the intact group of rats, the rate of disappearance of NE was faster and for the hypox rats it was slower than the rate for control rats not treated with the peptides. NE levels in the same area at time 0 were 11 percent lower than controls in hypox rats and unchanged in unoperated animals. (2) After the injection of MIF-I (20 mg/kg IP daily x 3) in similar experiments as with MSH, a reduced rate (p less than 0.05) of NE disappearance for the first 4 hr and an increased rate (p less than 0.05) of NE disappearance for the last 2 hr of the experiments occurred for both the intact and hypox rats in the mid-brain area where endogenous NE levels were lowered by 11 and 12 percent at 0 min. In no other brain areas were alterations in NE breakdown found in both the intact and hypox rat groups. Behavioral changes have been found previously under similar experimental conditions in both intact and hypox rats. (3) Rates of dopamine disappearance in experiments similar to those described for NE disappearance indicated that in the striatal brain area no change was found in the intact rats after either MSH or MIF-I, whereas a decrease in DA disappearance was found for hypox rats during the six hour experimental period only after MSH. The results indicate that a correlation between behavioral changes, rates of disappearance and endogenous levels of NE in the mid-brain area may occur after MIF-I at the times examined but that a similar correlation for MSH did not appear likely.\n",
      "Self-administration of psychomotor stimulant drugs: the effects of unlimited access. Rhesus monkeys surgically prepared with intravenous catheters were given 23 hr daily access to injection of either cocaine, d-amphetamine, 1-amphetamine, d-methamphetamine or diethylpropion on a fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement for a maximum of 30 days. Responding was maintained by all these drugs but showed both day-to-day and hour-to-hour variability. The two animals self-administering 0.2 mg/kg/infusion cocaine died in less than 5 days. All 6 animals given access to 0.05 mg/kg/infusion d-amphetamine or 0.025 mg/kg/infusion d-methamphetamine also died, but tended to survive more days than animals exposed to cocaine. Three of the 5 animals whose responding was maintained by 0.5 mg/kg/infusion diethylpropion and one of the two animals whose responding was maintained by 0.05 mg/kg/infusion 1-amphetamine survived the entire 30 days despite high rates of intake. Food intake was initially decreased, but often returned to predrug levels and was not related to level of drug intake.\n",
      "Rate-dependent effects of drugs: a review of the literature. It has been claimed that the effects of amphetamines on schedule-controlled behavior depend to a large extent on the rate of responding in control conditions. A review of the literature shows that there is considerable support for this hypothesis if the behavior is not suppressed by aversive procedures, is not under the control of powerful external stimuli or is not occurring very infrequently. The extension of a rate-dependency hypothesis to the effects of other drugs has less empirical support, however. It is argued that many of the procedures used for studying rate-dependent drug effects do not provide critical tests of the hypothesis. If it is to be shown unequivocally that it is rate of operant responding which determines the behavioral effects of drugs, procedures are needed in which other varibles such as reinforcement frequency are more adequately controlled.\n",
      "Effect of various 6-hydroxydopamine treatments during development on growth and ingestive behavior. Destruction of catecholamine-containing fibers in brain at 5 days of age with intracisternal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine reduced body growth, intake of a sucrose solution, and acquisition of an active avoidance response. Further characterization of behavioral deficits indicated that treated animals also showed reduced ingestion of saline solution when injected with desoxycorticosterone and a decreased eating response to insulin. In addition, all of these deficits produced by catecholamine depletion with 6-hydroxydopamine were observed in rats in which brain dopamine was preferentially reduced but not in rats having preferential destruction of noradrenergic fibers, suggesting that dopamine depletion amounts for the observed alterations in developing animals. Although animals treated with 6-hydroxydopamine at 14 days showed reduced intake of a sucrose solution, they did not have reduced growth. Since early malnourishment reduced growth, it seems possible that the reduced growth observed after destruction of dopaminergeic fibers may be related to an acute reduction of food intake which is perpetuated by persistent deficits in ingestive behavior. Evidence implicating malnourishment in other deficits produced by 6-hydroxydopamine could not be obtained.\n",
      "Schedule-induced oral self administration of etonitazene. Rats were induced to drink either a saline-etonitazene solution or a saline solution with a schedule-induced polydipsia paradigm. When water was freely available, the rats continued to drink the saline solution or the saline-etonitazene solution, rather than the water. When the locations of the solutions were switched, the rats that were drinking saline switched to water (drank at the usual location), but the rats that were drinking saline-etonitazene continued to drink the saline-etonitazene solution (drank from the bottle at the other location). Naloxone administration temporarily eliminated the drinking of saline-etonitazene solution, but not that of saline solution.\n",
      "Enzyme activity in sleep and sleep deprivation. Liver tyrosine transaminase activity is low during the day when the rats are mostly asleep and high during the night when they are awake. When wakefulness was imposed for 8 hr during daylight on the day of the experiment and the rats were allowed to sleep for the following 3 hr during darkness, the tyrosine transaminase activity became high during the day and low at night. That this reversal in enzyme activity is not mediated by the pituitary-adrenal axis is demonstrated by the fact that in adrenalectomized rats tyrosine transaminase activity increased during the day in the sleep deprived rats. However, in these rats the enzyme activity did not become low in the sleep-deprived-sleeping condition. Changes in tryptophan pyrrolase activity during sleep deprivation were demonstrated to be mediated by the pituitary-adrenal axis.\n",
      "The genetics of the mimetic butterfly Hypolimnas bolina (L.). Hypolimnas bolina is a Nymphalid butterfly having a west to east distribution from Madagascar to Easter Island, and a north to south one from Japan to Australasia. It is highly migratory in some areas. In much of the western part of its range the female is both monomorphic and a mimic of Euploea. Further east it is frequently polymorphic with the majority of the forms being non-mimetic. The polymorphism is sex-limited to the female and controlled by two unlinked loci, one with two allelomorphs, E and e, determining the extent of the dark pigmentation, the other with three allelomorphs, P, Pn and p, determining the presence and distribution of orange-brown. Only butterflies of the genotypes EEpp and to a lesser extent Eepp are satisfactory Batesian mimics of their Euploea models. The details of the mimetic pattern are under multifactorial control, following those of their local model, as is much of the variation within the non-mimetic forms, particularly with regard to the distribution of white and blue scaling.\n",
      "Terrestrial vertebrates of the New Hebrides: origin and distribution. The known terrestrial vertebrate fauna of the New Hebrides consists of 16 species of mammals (excluding feral domestic stock), 61 species of resident land- and freshwater birds, 20 species of reptiles and one amphibian. Of these, three, five, four and one species respectively have apparently been introduced by man. The non-introduced fauna is clearly Indo-Australian in origin, but some species have an exclusively Pacific island distribution and others (two bats, seven birds, and four lizards) are endemic. On the six islands visited 95 out of the possible 98 vertebrate species occur. Santo, the largest and most northerly island, supports the richest fauna. The comparative impoverishment of more southerly islands is not directly attributable to the progressive increase in isolation and distance from presumptive source area, nor to decrease in island area or maximum height.\n",
      "5-Aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase: structure, function, and mechanism. delta-Aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase catalyses the synthesis of porphobilinogen. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 285000 and is composed of eight similar subunits of molecular mass 35000. The N-terminal amino acid is acylated, and the number of peptides found on tryptic digestion equals the number of lysine and arginine residues per mass of 35000. The eight subunits are apparently arranged at the corners of a cube and therefore have dihedral (D4) symmetry. The bovine liver enzyme which has been cystallized contains 4--6 atoms of zinc per mole of enzyme. The apo-enzyme obtained on prolonged hydrolysis can be reactivated by the addition of zinc or cadmium ions. The dialysed enzyme must be first treated with dithiothreitol. There are two very active SH groups in a total of 6--7-SH groups per subunit. The substrate forms a Schiff base with the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue. Reduction of the Schiff base with NaBH4 should reveal the number of active sites per mole of enzyme. It appears that only four of the eight subunits form a Schiff base with the substrate indicating that the enzyme exhibits the phenomenon of either half-site reactivity or negative cooperativity. The enzyme appears to have a strong subunit-subunit interaction for an immobilized preparation remained stable for at least a month. An immobilized enzyme preparation was treated in a manner so that it dissociated into tetramers. Both the eluate and protein still attached to the Sepharose on a column were enzymically active. The bound enzyme could not reassociate under assay conditions but still contained about 50% of the original enzyme activity. It would seem that the enzyme is active when composed with less than eight subunits.\n",
      "Mechanism and stereochemistry of enzymic reactions involved in porphyrin biosynthesis. 5-Aminolaevulinate synthetase cataylses the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to give 5-aminolaevulinic acid. At least two broad pathways may be considered for the initial C--C bond forming step in the reaction. In pathway A the Schiff base of glycine and enzyme bound pyridoxal phosphate (a) undergoes decarboxylation to give the carbanion (b) which then condenses with succinyl-CoA with the retention of both the original C2 hydrogen atoms of glycine. In pathway B, loss of a C2 hydrogen atom gives another type of carbanion (c) that reacts with succinyl-CoA. Evidence has been presented to show that the initial C--C bond forming event occurs via pathway B which involves the removal of the pro R hydrogen atom of glycine. Subsequent mechanistic and stereochemical events occurring at the carbon atom destined to become C5 of 5-aminolaevulinate have also been delineated.(Carticle) Several mechanistic alternatices for the formation of the two vinyl groups of haem from the propionate residues of the precursor, coproporphyrinogen III, have been examined. (see article). It is shown that during the biosynthesis both the hydrogen atoms resident at the alpha positions of the propionate side chains remain undisturbed thus eliminating mechanisms which predict the involvement of acrylic acid intermediates. Biosynthetic experiments performed with precursors containing stereospecific labels have shown that the two vinyl groups of haem are formed through the loss of pro S hydrogen atoms from the beta-positions of the propionate side chains. In the light of these results, three related mechanisms for the conversion, propionate leads to vinyl, have been considered. In order to study the mechanism of porphyrinogen carboxy-lyase reaction, stereo-specifically deuterated, tritiated-succinate was incorporated into the acetate residues of uroporphyrinogen III which on decarboxylation generated asymmetric methyl groups in coproporphyrinogen III and then in haem. Degradation of the latter yielded chiral acetate deriving from C and D rings of haem. Configurational analysis of this derivate acetate shows that the carboxy-lyase reaction proceeds with a retention of configuration.\n",
      "Biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogens from porphobilinogen: mechanism and the nature of the process. The enzymic self-polymerization of prophobilinogen gives rise to the cyclic tetrapyrroles uroporphyrinogen III and uroporphyrinogen I. The former is the precursor of all the natural porphyrins and chlorins. The formation of uroporphyrinogen III is catalysed by a dual enzymic system, porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. Deaminase polymerizes four porphobilinogen units on the enzymic surface, without liberation of free intermediates into the reaction medium, and forms uroporphyrinogen I. Cosynthase enters into association with the deaminase, and acts as a 'specifier protein' of the latter, changing the mode of porphobilinogen condensation on the enzymic surface. The association is independent of the presence of substrate. While deaminase catalyses the head-to-tail condensation of the porphobilinogen units, the association deaminase-cosynthase catalyses the head-to-head condensation of the same units. As a result different enzyme-bound dipyrrylmethanes are formed form the beginning of the process, and this can be demonstrated by using synthetic dipyrrylmethanes and tripyrranes.\n",
      "Biosynthesis of porphyrins and corrins. Haem, chlorophyll and vitamin B12 are all derived ultimately from four molecules of the pyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG) and the initial enzyme catalysed condensation of PBG leads to the unsymmetrical type III isomer of uroporphyrinogen. On the basis of straightforward chemical considerations the type I isomer should be formed and so the porphyrinogen-forming enzymes of all living systems must catalyse a highly specific rearrangement process. The nature and chemical mechanism of this rearrangement poses one of the most fascinating problems in the porphyrin field and so it is not surprising that over 20 hypothetical schemes have been proposed to account for it. Analysis of the problem suggested that the incorporation of doubly 13C-labelled precursors into the rearranged macrocyclic rings would give valuable new information on the nature of the rearrangement process. In this approach the meso=bridge atoms are of crucial importance, and several unambiguous syntheses of 13C-labelled pyrroles and porphyrins were developed to allow rigorous n.m.r. assignments to be made, and also to provide substrates for enzymic experiments. Studies carried out with enzymes from both avian blood and from Euglena gracilis have revealed the precise nature of the assembly of four PBG molecules into the type-III macrocycle: it is the same in both systems despite their vastly different evolutionary development. Complementary studies are in progress in order to determine the intermediates involved in the conversion of PBG into uroporphyrinogen III. The synthesis of amino methyl pyrromethanes and their interaction in the presence of PBG with the appropriate enzyme systems are described. It is important for the work to be able to separate not only isomeric pyrromethanes but also the four isomeric coproporphyrins. Powerful methods are described which make use of high pressure liquid chromatography for both types of separation process. Once uroporhyrinogen III has been built enzymically, there is a stepwise enzymic decarboxylation of the four acetic acid residues. A heptacarboxylic porphyrin shown to be a type-III porphyrin is isolated from the action of avian blood enzymes on porphobilinogen. Spectroscopic studies with 13C-labelling limit the possible structures to two and total synthesis of these substances shows that the natural product carries its methyl group on ring D. An isomeric heptacarboxylic porphyrin having its methyl group on ring C is of particular interest in relation to the biosynthesis of vitamin B12. This substance is synthesized together with uroporphyrin III, 14C-labelled specifically in ring C. This latter product is used to settle one of the key questions concerning nature's route to vitamin B12 - that is, does the corrin macrocycle arise from uroporphyrinogen III? Incorporation studies and specific degradations prove specific incorporation of uroporphyrinogen III into cobyrinic acid, which is the known precursor of vitamin B12.\n",
      "Synthesis of probable and improbable precursors for porphyrin biosynthesis. Insights into details of the biomechanism by which porphobilinogen (1) cyclotetramerizes to uroporphyrinogen III (2) as well as promising synthetic applications are provided by investigation of this reaction in vitro. The cyclotetramerization of newly prepared norporphobilinogen (5) proved to be extemely specific due to strong conformation control. Advantage was taken of this finding by preparing a N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-porphyrinogen (13a) for the first time. Protected derivatives of the linear tetramer of porphobilinogen (20c) which is regarded as an intermediate of the cyclotetramerization were gained by total synthesis and their transformations investigated.\n",
      "Macrocyclic intermediates in the biosynthesis of porphyrins. The hepta-, hexa- and penta-carboxylic porphyrins found in the faeces of rats poisoned with hexachlorobenzene have been separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and characterized largely by spectroscopie methods. Their structures were confirmed by total synthesis, as part of a programme in which eleven of the fourteen hepta-, hexa- and penta-carboxylic porphyrins derived from uroporphyrin III have now been synthesized as their methyl esters. The four isomeric heptacarboxylic and three of the pentacarboxylic porphyrinogens have been incubated with haemolysates of chicken erythrocytes, and they are all converted into protoporphyrin IX but at different rates. On the basis of this and other evidence we conclude that the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III is a stepwise process taking place by a preferred pathway (both in normal and abnormal metabolism); the acetic acid groups are decarboxylated in a sequential clockwise fashion starting with that on the D ring and followed by those on the A, B and C rings. In the poisoned rats the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme (or group of enzymes) is probably partially inhibited and the pentacarboxylic porphyrinogen with an acetic acid group on ring C accumulates. The latter is then transformed by a side pathway into dehydroisocoproporphyrinogen and thence into dehydroisocoproporphyrin and its congeners.\n",
      "Neovitamin B12 (cyano-13-epicobalamin). Beta-Epimerization in the corrinoid system has recently emerged as a complicating factor in the latter stages of the total synthesis of vitamin B12 (Eschenmoser 1971; Woodward 1973). It has also found some application in biosynthetic studies on the origin of the methyl groups in ring C (Scott, Townsend &amp; Cushley 1973; Scott, this Discussion p. 303). This paper sets out to review briefly the beta-epimerization of corrinoid polyamides, with particular reference to our work on the neo-series which provided the first established example of this phenomenon.\n",
      "The biosynthesis of vitamin B12. The use of 13C-Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (F.t.-n.m.r.) has led to the observation that while 8 molecules of [2-13C]ALA are incorporated into vitamin B12 in P. shermanii, [5-13C]ALA labels only seven of the carbon atoms of cyanocobalamin, i.e. one of the amino methyl groups of ALA is \"lost\" in the process. It has also been confirmed that seven of the methyl groups of B12 are derived from 13CH3-enriched methionine and further that the chirality of the gemdimethyl grouping at C12 labelled with [13CH3]methionine is R. A soluble enzyme mixture from the 37000 or 100000 g supernatant of disrupted cells of P. shermanii converts both 14 C-labelled ALA and [14C]uro'gen III to cobyrinic acid, the simplest corrinoid material on the pathway to vitamin B12 and the coenzyme, in presence of NADPH, Co2+, Mg2+, S-adenosyl-methionine and glutathione. Multiply-labelled uro'gens (13C, 14C and 3H) have been used to show that incorporation takes place without randomization. A sequence for corrin synthesis from uro'gen III is presented.\n",
      "Synthesis of corrins and related macrocycles based on pyrrolic intermediates. Intermediate in structure between porphyrins and corrins are the corroles and 1-methyltetradehydrocorrins. These ring systems, like the porphyrins, can be obtained by cyclization of linear tetrapyrrolic compounds, reactions which have been shown to proceed by orbital symmetry-allowed electrocyclic processes, and examples will be quoted. Thermolysis of nickel 1-methyltetradehydrocorrins causes a migration of the methyl group whereas similar treatment of nickel 1,19-dimethyltetradehydrocorrin salts yields porphyrin derivatives; the mechanisms of these transformations have been elucidated. Stepwise hydrogenation of metal tetradehydrocorrin salts (10 double bonds) yields a series of macrocycles containing 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 double bonds and conditions necessary to obtain corrins have been established.\n",

      "Chemical reactivities of tetrapyrrole pigments: a comparison of experimentalbehaviour with the results of s.c.f.-pi-m.o. calculations. Porphyrins are highly sigma-electron donating bases and very weak pi-acids. Hence they increase the electron density  on central metal ions, e.g. iron, which leads to the specific reactivity of haem cytochromes, haemoglobin and oxidizing enzymes. The macrocyclic chlorin ligand behaves similarly but to a lesser degree which explains the comparably low oxidation potential of chlorophyll. Phlorins, oxophlorins, oxa- and aza-orphyrins, tetradehydrocorrins, corrins and biliverdins all produce metal complexes which have a similar geometry to that of metalloporphyrins, but their reactivity patterns are different. In contrast to the metalloporphyrins which undergo many fully reversible reactions, these compounds tend to irreversible addition and cleavage reactions. The tetrapyrrole ligands are stronger pi-acids than porphyrins. Results of some recent experimental work and pi-electron s.c.f. calculations are presented in support of these generalizations.\n",
      "The structures of some cobalamins in solution. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to examine the conformations of cobalamins in solution. The perturbation of the resonances in the n.m.r. spectra by lanthanide probes provided particularly valuable information. Except for minor details the conformations are the same as those in the crystalline state. The temperature dependence of the conformation has been reassessed.\n",
      "Control of 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase activity in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. Rhodopseudomonas spheroides can grow in a defined medium with either light or oxygen as an energy source. Cells grown anaerobically or at very low oxygen tensions are rich in the photosynthetic pigment bacteriochlorophyll, whereas this pigment is virtually absent in cells grown under high oxygen tensions. Aminolaevulinate synthetase, the first enzyme on the pathway to bacteriochlorophyll, appears to play an important role in the control of bacteriochlorophyll synthesis. Thus, the enzyme has a high activity in extracts of pigmented cells and a low activity in extracts of non-pigmented cells. Further, oxygenation of a pigmented culture causes immediate cessation of pigment synthesis and produces a rapid fall in the activity of aminolaevulinate synthetase. This loss of activity appears to be due to the loss of an endogenous activator of the enzyme. Thus, pigmented cells contain cystine trisulphide, which at muM concentrations is an activator of aminolaevulinate synthetase, while oxygenation causes a rapid fall in the cellular content of this trisulphide. Cystathionase (EC 4.2.1.15) extracted from pigmented cells can catalyse the formation of cystine trisulphide from cystine, while rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) extracted from the same cells can catalyse the degradation of cystine trisulphide in the presence of sulphite to form cystine and thiosulphate. It is proposed that the cellular content of cystine trisulphide is controlled by changes in the levels of substrates for cystathionase and possibly rhodanese rather than changes in the amounts of these enzymes. Cystine trisulphide controls the activity of aminolaevulinate synthetase by converting a low-activity form of the enzyme (b-form) into a high-activity form (a-form). The fall in aminolaevulinate synthetase activity on oxygenation appears to be the result of cessation of conversion of b-form into a-form, along with a conversion of a-form into b-form. Factors affecting the equilibrium between the forms and the possible mechanisms for their interconversion are discussed.\n",
      "The structural subunit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (baker's yeast). The subunit molecular weight of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) from baker's yeast has been evaluated. The subunit molecular weight value is shown to be 25,500 daltons by analytical ultracentrifugation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the number of peptides produced by CNBr cleavage. The number of NADP binding sites was determined to be one per 25,500 dalton unit.\n",
      "Study of cystinaminopeptidase heterogeneity in animal sera by the isoelectric focusing method. Study of the quantitative distribution of cystinaminopeptidase activity in the serum of pregnant and control animals (cow, sheep and rat) by the isoelectric focusing method showed heterogeneity of the cystinaminopeptidase activity of the animals' serum enzymatic system, which was well pronounced in the cow and rat and less pronounced in the sheep. The authors assume from their results that the principal difference between the pregnant and control animals is not the total increase in the level of activity of the enzyme in question, but the shift in its incidence, or the increase in activity at a given pH. It is possible that pregnancy, in man and animals, produces in the serum cystinaminopeptidase system (which is evidently heterogeneous even under normal, physiological conditions) given changes, i.e. the formation of new fractions with a different pI from the controls; other fractions disappear, or their activity diminishes.\n",
      "Thiopental anaesthesia and the acid-base balance in the blood of experimental dogs. An analysis of basic parameters representative of the acid-base balance was made in arterial blood samples from 140 clinically healthy dogs, under a general intravenous Thiopental anaesthesia. The following mean values +/- S.E.M. were obtained: pH = 7.33 +/- 0.01; pCO2 = 47.16 +/- 0.95; base excess = -2.12 +/- 0.27; buffer base = 46.63 +/- 0.37. The results showed a prevalent trend of lower values of pH, base excess and buffer base and higher values of pCO2 than those found commonly in human clinical practice. Special attention was paid to the respiratory component of the acid-base balance (ABB) revealing certain undesirable side effect of Thiopental anaesthesia.\n",
      "Fast neutron and x-ray induced single strand DNA breaks in cultured mammalian cells. The relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of fast neutrons in the production of single strand DNA breaks is 1.6 as compared to that of 250 kVp x rays. Monolayers of L-929 cells were treated with dinitrophenol during irradiation to prevent the DNA strands from rejoining; the extent of DNA damage was measured by the alkaline sucrose sedimentation method. The RBE for DNA damage is essentially the same as the RBE measured by cell survival methods.\n",
      "Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis by sulphasalazine and its metabolites. Sulphasalazine (SZ) inhibits prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis in vitro with a potency comparable to that of aceylsalicylate. The metabolites of SZ, sulphapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, were of considerably lower potency as inhibitors of PG biosynthesis in the synthetase preparations used. Th inhibition of prostaglandin production by SZ could at least partly account for the clinical utility of sulphasalazine in ulcerative colitis. Sulphapyridine may help to maintain inhibitory concentrations of SZ by restraining bacterial breakdown of the active drug.\n",
      "Partial characterization of prostaglandin synthetase in the reproductive tract of the male house cricket, Acheta domesticus. An active prostaglandin (PG) synthetase was found in the 12100 g pellet of reproductive tract homogenates of the male house cricket, Acheta domesticus. Comparatively, the 12100 g supernatant and the microsomal fractions were inactive. The PG synthetase in the pellet fraction was characterized in terms of cofactor, temperature, pH, and incubation time requirements. Indomethacin, a known inhibitor of mammalian PG synthetase, was not inhibitory to the cricket synthetase. The procedure and findings are relevant to PG synthetase studies of any organism or tissue.\n",
      "Hydroxyzine hydrochloride: possible adverse cardiac interactions. Hydroxyzine hydrochloride may produce abnormal ventricular repolarization when given in substratial doses or to susceptible individuals. Phenothiazines, such as thioridazine, tricyclic antidepressants, or antiparkinson drugs, any of which may be given concurrently to psychiatric patients, may augment this effect as well as atropine, quinidine or procainamide. Such EKG abnormalities may increase the likelihood of dysrhythmias and sudden death.\n",
      "Assessment of antipsychotic activity of an unique agent: SU-23397. SU-23397 is a unique new hybrid molecule, the animal profile being characteristic of neuroleptic activity. Although the trial was uncontrolled, there appears to be no doubt that SU-23397 exerts antipsychotic activity between 20 mg and 250 mg daily in severely ill schizophrenic patients. Seven of the ten subjects required at least transient antiparkinson medication. Two patients demonstrated premature ventricular contractions. One patient had infrequent PVCs at baseline which increased in frequency with rising dosage. The other patient developed frequent premature ventricular contractions only after active and medication was initiated and was subsequently withdrawn from the study.\n",
      "The effect of various chlorpromazine derivatives on the apomorphine-elicited inhibition of synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase activity. The effects of chlorpromazine and of some metabolites of chlorpromazine on the apomorphine-elicited inhibition of synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase activity were investigated. Chlorpromazine, nor1-chlorpromazine and 7-hydroxychlorpromazine reverse the apomorphine-elicited inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity while nor1-chlorpromazine sulfoxide and nor2-chlorpromazine sulfoxide have no effect on this inhibition. 6-Hydroxychlorpromazine and promethazine also reverse the enzyme inhibition by apomorphine but are less potent than chlorpromazine or 7-hydroxychlorpromazine. These results show that chlorpromazine and its metabolites with antipsychotic activity are more effective in reversing the apomorphine-elicited inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase than those metabolites which are devoid of antipsychotic activity.\n",
      "Effects of benzodiazepines on the binding of tryptophan in serum. Consequences on 5-hydroxyindoles concentrations in the rat brain. Benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide) inhibited competitively the binding of tryptophan onto rat serum albumin. As a result, in vivo treatment with one of these compounds (chlordiazepoxide for instance) induced a significant increase in the concentration of free tryptophan in serum. These observations suggest that the high levels of both 5-hydroxyindoles and tryptophan which occurred in the rat brain after any benzodiazepine administration could be at least partly the consequence of its effect on tryptophan binding in blood.\n",
      "The search for the dopamine receptor: tribulations. In an attempt to identify specific binding to dopamine receptors the binding of 3H-pimozide to preparations of brain and to an artificial cellulose membrane was examined. Binding occurred rapidly, was pH and temperature dependent, and was displaceable by other neuroleptics. Displaceable binding was saturable at 5 X 10(-8) M pimozide. A weak correlation between IC50's for displacement of binding by drugs and their clinical potencies was observed. Displaceable binding of 3H-pimozide in different brain areas did not correlate with dopamine levels. The similarity of binding properties to brain and to artificial membrane suggests that these effects are a function of the physical-chemical properties of these drugs, and that these properties may be related to their clinical effect.\n",
      "Functional heterogeneity within neurotransmitter systems. This paper reviews experiments that have revealed distinct differences between the dorsal and median raphe nuclei in the rat midbrain. The raphe nuclei appear to be hetrogeneous with respect to their anatomical projections to the forebrain, their relevance to specific behaviors, and their pharmacological responses. Startle response measures are useful indicators of the functional state of serotonergic system originating in the median raphe. As a way to study individual cells within the various raphe nuclei, microspectroflurimetric techniques are promising.\n",
      "Benzodiazepines and reproduction of swiss-webster mice. Chronic dietary administration of 6 different benzodiazepine tranquilizers (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, flurazepam, and nitrazepam) to breeding pairs of Swiss-Webster mice resulted in alterations of the normal patterns of reproductive behavior and fetal growth. Significant decreases in mating performance were seen among mice given diets containing 0.15% chlordiazepoxide, 0.05% diazepam, 0.05 and 0.15% oxazepam, 0.02 and 0.10% prazepam, 0.10% flurazepam, and 0.025% nitrazepam. Offspring in all drug treatments showed significantly depressed body weights at birth.\n",
      "In vitro and in vivo studies of (1-sarcosine, 8-threonine) angiotensin II. The capacity of (1-Sarcosine, 8-Threonine) angiotensin II to block the contractile and pressor effects of exogenous and endogenous angiotensin II was examined. In isolated rabbit aorta, the pA2 value (from pA2 plots) for the analog was 8.75 +/- 0.11. Both the maximum response and the slope of the dose-response curve to angiotensin II were unchanged by the analog. In ganglion-blocked vagotomized rats, infusion of the analog produced a dose-dependent blockage of the angiotensin II pressor effect. In these rats, the analog displayed less agonistic activity than that of (1-Sarcosine, 8-Isoleucine) and (1-Sarcosine, 8-Alanine) angiotensin II. In two-kidney hypertensive rats, the angiotensin II antagonist significantly reduced the arterial blood pressure. The results indicate that (1-Sar, 8-Thr) angiotensin II is a potent antagonist of angiotensin II with less inherent agonistic activity than previously reported analogs.\n",
      "The effect of mercuric chloride intoxication on urinary psi-glutamyl transpeptidase excretion in the sheep. The activity of the enzyme psi-glutamyl transpeptidase (psi-GT) was measured in the urine of sheep. In clinically normal animals the mean value was 6-3+/-0-6 mU/ml. In sheep with  kidney damage induced by the administration of mercuric chloride there were marked increases in urinary concentrations of psi-GT, in some cases values in excess of 1000 mU/ml were recorded. This enzyme may be of value in the diagnosis of certain forms of renal disease.\n",
      "Nucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphodiesterase I. Demonstration of activity in normal serum, and an increase in cholestatic liver disease. Nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity with uridine diphosphoglucose and dephospho-CoA as substrates was demonstrated in normal human serum. The enzyme has a pH-optimum of about 9.6 and is inhibited by EDTA. Phosphodiesterase I (hydrolysis of thymidine-5'-monophospho-p-nitrophenylester) was also found in normal human serum, with a pH-optimum of about 9.8 and a Km of 0.20-0.25 mM. Probably both activities should be attributed to one enzyme. Different isoenzymes may exist, however. The activity of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I in normal serum in many respects resembles an enzyme previously isolated from liver plasma membranes. Phosphodiesterase I activity was increased in normal pregnancy, in primary biliary cirrhosis, and in patients with bone lesions, but not in acute viral hepatitis or active chronic hepatitis. In primary biliary cirrhosis, the activity of phosphodiesterase I paralleled an increase of alkaline phosphatases.\n",
      "[The value of renin determination in the diagnosis of hypertension]. Primary aldosteronism and renovascular hypertension are two different diseases in which renin determinations are necessary for establishment of diagnosis or therapeutic procedure. Low renin values which are not stimulated by acute stimuli combined with elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations confirm the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. When in a patient with proven renal artery stenosis a significant difference in renal venous renin activity is observed between the two kidneys, a connection between hypertension and renal artery stenosis is likely when in addition the renin secretion of the unaffected kidney is suppressed. A favourable outcome for surgery can be predicted when the individual clinical picture in such a case is also considered. A similar view also holds for the connection between hypertension and unilateral small kidney not due to renal artery stenosis. In essential hypertension the plasma renin level makes it possible to a certain extent to predict whether a patient will benefit from diuretics or from beta-blocking agents. Despite this experience, however, renin determinations are not indicated in every case of essential hypertension. It has not been proven that the prognosis of this disease is improved by renin oriented monotherapy rather than by effective treatment with other antihypertensive agents.\n",
      "Alpha-adrenergic receptor identification by (3H)dihydroergocryptine binding. A radioactively labeled alpha-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]dihydroergocryptine, binds specifically to a site on rabbit uterine membranes. Binding is rapid, reaching equilibrium in less than 17 minutes at 25 degrees C. Adrenergic agonists compete for this binding site with an order of affinities identical to the pharmacological potency order of these agents as alpha-adrenergic agonists (epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than isoprotereonl). The (-) stereoisomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine are 30 times more potent in competing for the site than the corresponding (+) stereoisomers. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists, such as phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, potently compete for the binding sites while the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol does not. Structural analogs of catecholamines that are devoid of alpha-adrenergic physiological activity do not compete for [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites. These data suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptors can be directly identified and studied by [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding.\n",
      "Aspartate: distinct receptors on Aplysia neurons. Aplysia neurons have specific aspartate receptors that are distinct from those to glutamate. In some cells, asparate selectively increases the membrane permeability to chloride, giving rise to a hyperpolarization, while on other cells it increases the permeability to sodium, causing a depolarization. There are also specific receptors for L-glutamate which mediate sodium, chloride, or potassium conductance increases, and another class of receptors activated by both glutamate and aspartate.\n",

      "Hypo-acidity of gastric juice in chronic gastric ulceration caused by neutralisation. Samples of gastric juice were aspirated every 15 minutes from 54 normal subjects and 31 patients with chronic gastric ulcers during a maximal histamine infusion test. The known tendency of patients with gastric ulcers to secrete a less acid gastric juice than that of normal subjects was confirmed. However, the hypo-acidity was related to the extent by which the total ionic concentration was less than the isotonic value of 328 mEq/l. On the assumption that such hypo-acidity was produced by the neutralisation of hydrogen ions by bicarbonate ions refluxing into the stomach from the duodenum, the data were corrected and resulted in a normal estimate of the hydrogen ion concentration in the gastric ulcer group. Independent corrections, according to the sodium content of refluxed duodenal juice, yielded similar results for the volume of gastric juice aspirated. It is concluded that while back-diffusion can explain the hypo-acidity of gastric juice in patients with gastric ulcers, duodenal reflux can explain both the hypo-acidity and the hypotonicity, and is therefore more likely to be the correct explanation.\n",
      "Antihypertensive therapy with timolol and alpha-methyldopa. A double-blind trial in patients with moderately severe hypertension. After 24 moderately severe hypertensive patients had been treated for 4 weeks with a placebo for timolol, alpha-methyldopa was added and titrated until control of the blood pressure or a total daily dose of 2 500 mg was achieved. At the 9th week, the dose of alpha-methyldopa was halved and either timolol or its placebo was titrated in double-blind fashion. Titration over a period of 4 weeks was followed by a further 5 weeks of stabilisation. In 22 patients whose responses were accepted for analysis, alpha-methyldopa caused a significant lowering of blood pressure, with a greater reduction in the upright posture and a reduction in pulse rate. The addition of timolol caused a highly significant further reduction in pulse rate and a significant reduction in blood pressure in 8 of 10 patients. Apart from a statistically significant increase in serum urea and creatinine with, however, retention of normal renal function, no other side-effects were attributable to timolol.\n",

      "The effect of antihistamines on experimental posttraumatic edema of the spinal cord. The present experiments were designed to test the effect of antihistamines on the formation of post-traumatic edema of the spinal cord. Ten rhesus monkeys received 600 gm cm injuries to the T10 level of the spinal cord. Five animals received antihistamine treatment and five animals acted as untreated controls. Posttraumatic edema was estimated using radio-active tagged serum albumin. A significant increase in radioactivity of the injured segment was demonstrated in both groups when compared to noninjured issue, but no difference was demonstrated in the radioactivity of the injured segment in the treated versus the nontreated group.\n",

      "Irreversible protein binding of norethisterone (norethindrone) epoxide. 14,15-3H-Norethisterone-4 beta, 5 beta-epoxide, a metabolite of norethisterone, was incubated with several proteins and nucleic acids. After 30 min incubation 0.19 nmol of the epoxide were irreversibly bound per mg albumin which contains free sulfhydryl groups; proteins without SH-groups, such as concanavalin A, gamma-globulin, DNA and RNA, did not irreversibly bind norethisterone epoxide. A superoxide (O2) generating enzyme system comprised of xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine was capable of catalyzing the irreversible binding of the parent compound, norethisterone, to albumin, indicating that an oxidation product was formed which reacted with the protein. When norethisterone epoxide was incubated for 60 min with hepatic microsomes of rats in absence of NADPH, about 2.0 nmol of the epoxide were irreversibly incorporated per mg microsomal protein. This binding was increased to 5.2 nmol by addition of a NADPH regenerating system. Addition of glutathione and cytosol decreased only the NADPH-dependent protein binding; phenobarbital pretreatment of rats induced this NADPH-dependent binding of norethisterone epoxide to microsomal protein by a factor of 2. In presence of NADPH, binding of the epoxide to microsomal protein depended on substrate concentration used. The results indicate that norethisterone epoxide is able to chemically react with proteins. In addition, hepatic microsomal enzymes convert the epoxide to another metabolite which also can react with proteins.\n",
      "Hydroxyapatite - a reagent for the separation of free and antibody-bound steroid during the radioimmunoassay. The use of hydroxyapatite to absorb antibody-bound steroid and thus separate free and antibody-bound steroid during radioimmunoassay has been examined using three steroid antisera (to testosterone, to 17-hydroxyprogesterone and to estradiol-17beta). For all three antisera studied the separation was shown to be independent of length of time in contact with hydroxyapatite (up to 1h); temperature variations from 4 degrees -37 degrees and pH over the range 4.9-8.0. The presence of protein affected the absorption of antibody-bound steroid but this effect could be overcome by the addition of increasing amounts of hydroxyapatite. Further increase in the amount of hydroxyapatite added had no effect on the separation of free and bound steroid. Sodium phosphate buffers of molarity greater than 0.01M eluted antibody-bount steroid from hydroxyapatite, but Tris-HC1 buffers up to molarities of 0.1 M had no effect. Hydroxyapatite when used as a dry powder had the same effects as suspensions. No effect on the cross-reactivities of the antisera used could be demonstrated when hydroxyapatite was used and plasma testosterone assays on 22 plasma samples using hydroxyapatite gave essentially the same results as assays on the plasma using a coated-tube assay. Hydroxyapatite can also be successfully pumped along small bore plastic tubing without settling and can thus be used in automated immunoassay systems.\n",
      "Influence of adrenergic receptor blockade on circulatory and metabolic effects of disordered neurotransmitter function in stroke patients. Cerebral hemispheric blood flow and metabolism were measured before and after therapy with intracarotid infusion of combined PBZ and PPL in 15 patients with recent cerebral infarction. HBF was unaltered despite decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. Cerebral hemispheric oxygen comsumption and carbon dioxide production decreased while cerebral hemispheric lactate production increased. Biphasic cerebral uptake of tyrosine was observed during and immediately after PBZ and PPL infusion. CSF HVA increased, indicating altered DA turnover. CSF 5HIAA levels also increased, suggesting altered 5HT turnover after PBZ and PPL. Release of cyclic AMP from ischemic brain into cerebral venous blood seen in the steady state was abolished after therapy. Cerebral hemodynamic studies suggest a functional balance between monaminergic neurogenic influences in the control of cerebral circulation. Imbalance of such controlling factors in ischemic brain may lead to paradoxical vascular responses to induced hypertension and hypotension. PBZ and PPL enhance such responses perhaps by increasing central neurotransmitter turnover and release. Further shift toward cerebral anaerobic metabolism may occur in ischemic brain following the use of phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Worsening of neurological deficit occurred in four cases. Combined therapy with PBZ and PPL does not appear beneficial in the therapy of patients with recent stroke.\n",
      "Action of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the urethral pressure profile. The action of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the urethral pressure profile was studied. Sotalol, 20 mg, and inderal, 7 mg, were administered intravenously. Whereas the alpha-adrenergic blocking drug phentolamine, as already known, changed the maximum value of the pressure profile with an average decrease of 33%, the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs did not show any action at all. There was no difference between the results obtained with Sotalol and Inderal.\n",

Distal urethral stenosis in girls as well as meatal and bulbar narrowed urethral segments in boys are still subjects of discussion about their pathologic value in the literature. The urodynamic findings in enuretic children by urethral pressure profile and cystometry frequently point to a outflow resistance. Calibration with bougies à boule, urethroscopy and permictional cysturethrography disclose such urethral narrowing. The survey of our own 107 enuritic children shows that urethrotomy has given good results relative to urodynamic data.

Reflux or dilatation of the upper urinary tract found in 26 children could be controlled by drugs or transurethral operations in 20, urinary diversion had to be done only 4 times. 26 children were selected for intensive treatment of incontinence; in about 50% satisfying urinary control was achieved. These results still need long-term observation. The main interest, however, was to postpone irreversible surgery and to gain time for possible better treatment in the future.\n",
      "[Treatment of hypertonus in diabetes mellitus]. When pathophysiological and pathogenetic aspects of hypertension are taken into consideration with special regard to diabetes mellitus the exhaustion of the \"insulin enhancement\" within the cerebrovisceral functional systems (Baumann) are discussed and the authors enter possible connections of diabetes mellitus to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. After explanation of the diabetogenic and antidiabetogenic pharmacodynamic qualities of the antihypertensive drugs adequate therapeutic recommendations are proposed summarized in a figure. The authors conclude that for the present antihypertensive therapy in diabetics taking into consideration the references reported on there are sufficient possibilities of treatment for all degrees of severity of hypertension. Such preparations as Rausedan, Disotat, Dopegyt appear as particularly suitable; moreover, the beta receptor blockers, Haemiton, Depressan as well as Guanitil and Pargylin prove to be possible or without disadvantage, respectively.

In borderline conditions of a sthenic pole the effectiveness of tranquilizers is equal or sometimes is even less than in therapy with small doses of neuroleptics. In treating neurotic conditions tranquilizers of the benzodiazepine group can be ranged in the following succession: nitrazepam, chlordiazepoxide, medazepam, oxazepam, diazepam, lorazepam.

      "Anesthesia for cesarean section III: effects of epidural analgesia on the respiratory adaptation of the newborn in elective cesarean section. A rise in fetal Paco2 was observed after elective cesarean section in patients anesthetized both with a barbiturate and with nitrous oxide/oxygen. Epidural analgesia seemed to be a good alternative in order to attain better blood gas values in the newborn infant. Fourteen healthy mothers and their infants were studied in connection with elective cesarean section. Epidural analgesia with plain bupivacaine 0.75% was used. Doses varied between 90 and 120 mg. The time between the epidural injection and delivery was around 50 min. In six cases the fetal heart rate was registered continuously. Most of the mothers were sedated with diazepam intravenously or fully anesthetized, after delivery. The mothers were interviewed later. The respiratory adaptation of the infants was studied by blood gas and acid-base measurements in repeated arterial samples during the first 3 hours of life. A comparison was made with a group previously studied, where general anesthesia with a barbiturate, nitrous oxide/oxygen was the method used. The present material showed no differences concerning Pao2 and Paco2 but clearly indicated a tendency towards an earlier normalization of the initial metabolic acidosis. Mothers showed a respiratory alkalosis which was overcompensated by the metabolic component. Maternal blood pressure falls were observed in four cases, and fetal effects could be detected. Although epidural analgesia has a more favorable effect upon the newborn's metabolic component, both the compared methods allow good respiratory adaptation provided they are used correctly. Mothers can be given the opportunity to choose between being conscious or asleep when their child is delivered.\n",

The influence of halothane (0.6 and 2%) upon cerebral (cortical) blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRo2) was studied in artificially ventilated rats, using a modified technique of Kety &amp; Schmidt (1948). The values obtained in halothane anaesthesia were compared to those recorded in nitrous oxide anaesthesia, or to those measured in unanesthetized animals given an analgesic drug (fentanyl citrate). Although it could be confirmed that halothane induces vasodilatation in the brain, there were relatively small differences in CBF between the groups. The results demonstrate that, in the rat, halothane depresses CMRo2 in a dose-dependent way. With 0.6% halothane, CMRo2 was reduced by 20-30% and, with 2% halothane, CMRo2 was reduced by about 50%. Thus, in the rat the effect of 2% halothane upon metabolic rate is comparable to that observed in barbiturate anaesthesia.\n",
      "Treatment of comatose patients by mechanical hyperventilation. In case of cranial trauma, early respiratory troubles either of central or peripheral origin often accelerate the deterioration of the neurological situation. The different values of PCO2, PO2, pH and alcaline reserve measured on samples of CSF in comatose patients prove the central acidosis related to metabolic and vascular disorders in the damaged areas. Our results confirm the correlation between the importance of this disturbances and the severity of the trauma. It is thus necessary to insure patients of satisfactory respiration conditions. The tracheobronchial cleansing is applicable to intubated or tracheotomized patients by an instillation of 5ml of simple or bicarbonated physiological serum 4 to 6 times a day, followed by repeated aspirations and associated to a preventive endotracheal instillation of 80 mg of Gentamycin 4 times a day. Moreover we use controlled respiration which does not modify the gazometric parameters in the CSF but which assures patients a normoxia and moderate hypocapnia with a decrease of intracranial hypertension. Treatment by controlled hyperventilation must be precocious, because the recuperation at the level of the damaged zones is very slow.\n",
      "Resistant transitory epilepsy in children. Three case histories are presented which are characterized by progressive, severe symptoms of mental and epileptic nature with EEG abnormalities of increasing severity culminating in \"hypsarhythmia\". The seizures were resistant to any treatment over a period of several months. Apparently spontaneous cures followed, and the patients remained healthy during follow-up, which ranged from 10 to 12 years. The observations confirm Lennox's remark that a miraculous cure may occasionally be expected in even severe, probably symptomatic, epilepsy. Some exogenous (infectious?) cause is suspected.\n",
      "A comparison of the cardiovascular effects of enflurane, halothane, methoxyflurane and fluroxene during open cardiac surgery. During open heart surgery hemodynamic changes due to 1.5% enflurane, 0.75% halothane, 0.18% methoxyflurane and 3.4% fluroxene have been compared. The following parameters have been measured: arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, right and left atrial pressure, left ventricular pressure and dp/dt. The strongest effects were found with enflurane and halothane. Marked reduction in cardiac index, stroke index, left ventricular dp/dt as well as reduction of peripheral resistance caused severe systemic hypotension. Because of its slow uptake methoxyflurane was followed by small hemodynamic changes in this study. The rapid acting fluroxene had caused only minor reductions of cardiac output, stroke volume and dp/dt. There was no decrease in peripheral resistance.\n",

A report is given from an on-going multicenter trial in Sweden, in which 117 hypertensive patients have been treated with a new cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, atenolol (ICI 66.082, Tenormin) for an average of six months (range 2-21). Statistically significant reductions of BP were observed, recumbent by 29/19 mmHg (p less than 0.0001) and standing by 28/18 mmHg (p less than 0.0001).

      "Hemodynamic long-term effects of timolol at rest and during exercise in essential hypertension. Sixteen men with previously untreated essential hypertension in WHO stage I have been studied as out-patients. Oxygen consumption, heart rate (HR), cardiac output (Q) (Cardiogreen) and intraarterial brachial pressure were recorded at rest in supine and sitting position and during steady state work at 300, 600 and 900 kpm/min. The subjects were treated with timolol as the sole drug for one year and the hemodynamic study was repeated. BP was reduced approximately 18% at rest and 14% during exercise, HR approximately 26% and the cardiac index 28% at rest supine and 32% at rest sitting. During exercise the reductions in Q were 25-30%. The calculated total peripheral resistance was significantly increased at rest as well as during exercise. The product of mean arterial pressure and HR was reduced about 40%. No severe side-effects were seen.\n",
      "[Energy state of the cerebral cortex of the cat during hyperventilation (author's transl)]. Average Po2 and Pco2, local blood flow and pH values in the cerebral cortex of the cat were measured during passive hyperventilation (arterial Pco2 below 19 mm Hg). At defined intervals tissue samples were taken for metabolite analysis. The object of the study was to correlate the data obtained on the brain surface with metabolic responses. Immediately after the start of hyperventilation blood flow decreased, average cortical tissue pressures of O2 and CO2 fell, and there was a simultaneous rise in cortical pH. At a later stage in the experiment the local blood supply reverted to its resting level. Despite a fivefold rise in tissue lactate level during hyperventilation and a decrease in local O2 pressure on the brain surface to 5-10 mm Hg the degree of phosphorylation of energy rich phosphates was not less than under normal conditions of oxygenation. Our investigations showed no evidence of energy lack in cerebral cortex cells during hyperventilation. Cellular hypoxia and its characteristics are defined. The possible causes of raised tissue lactate levels during hyperventilation despite the lack of evidence of cellular hypoxia are discussed.\n",
      "[Postoperative mental blocking in a continuous reaction task. With supplementary results showing the influence of age (author's transl)]. By means of a four colour device for measuring continuous reaction sequences the mental blockings of brain damaged patients in comparison with patients suffering from skin disease were determined. Differences due to age were also investigated. The analysis of frequency distribution of reaction times (dissection method according to Daeves and Beckel) yielded the following results: a) Brain damaged patients show a higher percentage of blockings (23%) than patients suffering from skin-disease (10%). \"Normal\" reaction times as well as \"blockings\" are not prolonged significantly. b) Older patients show prolonged normal reaction times and prolonged blockings without increase in the percentage of blockings. c) Patients with left hemisphere lesions show longer normal reaction times than those who undergo right hemisphere operations. The results are discussed with regard to their significance for theory and practice (road accidents).\n",
      "Immunosuppression by fetal liver as a model for tolerance to self. The embryonic liver chimera system was used as a model to study the development of tolerance to self antigens. It was found that the permanent tolerant state which was induced in (C3H/eb x C57BL/6)F1 irradiated hosts following reconstitution with parental C57BL liver cells could be due to the development of suppressor cells within the liver cell inoculum, which specifically prevent reactivity of immunocompetent cells. General suppressor activity could be found in embryonic liver cells at early stages of gestation. However, the differentiation of such cells into specific suppressor of \"self\" antigens is dependent on the presence of the thymus.\n",
      "Suppressor cells in the embryonic thymus mediate allograft tolerance. Thymus cells from non-immunized young chickens suppress the allograft rejection in lightly irradiated syngeneic or allogeneic recipients and mediate longlasting skingraft survival in a significant proportion of recipients across a strong histocompatibility difference. Suppressive activity of this kind is already found in the embryonic thymus and is therefore believed to mediate also self tolerance and neonatal allograft tolerance.\n",
      "Internal mammary artery bypass graft in reoperative myocardioal revascularization. Thirty-two consecutive patients who earlier received indirect or direct myocardial revascularization underwent reoperation with one or more internal mammary artery grafts either alone or in combination with saphenous vein grafts. The main indication for reoperation was graft closure or progression of coronary atherosclerosis in nongrafted vessels, or both. Graft construction was performed under normothermic perfusion and anoxic arrest with interrupted suture technique. No intraoperative infarctions or hospital deaths occurred. All patients are alive after an average follow-up period of 20 months, and two thirds are asymptomatic. Arteriography after reoperation in nine patients revealed patency of eight of nine internal mammary artery and five of five secondary vein grafts. When angiographic and symptomatic indications for reoperation exist, the internal mammary artery bypass graft has become a valuable alternative, particularly for patients with small coronary vessels or previous vein graft failure.\n",
      "Evaluation of a 5-mum stainless steel filter as an intravenous inline filter or prefilter. The suitability of a 5-mum stainless steel filter as an inline filter or a protective prefilter during simulated i.v. therapy was evaluated using flow rate measurements of two routinely used i.v. fluids and parenteral nutrition fluid. As an inline i.v. filter, the 5-mum stainless steel filter was capable of maintaining suitable flow rates. The addition of antibiotic additives decreased the flow rates slightly but not below the range required for i.v. therapy. Flow rate profiles, however, when compared to a 0.45-mum membrane filter suggest that antibiotic additives contain high numbers of particles in the less than 5-mum range. Consequently many of the particles, especially those in the less than 3-mum range will pass the 5-mum filter. As a protective prefilter, the 5-mum filter device in combination with a 0.45-mum membrane filter provided more uniform flow rates over longer periods of time when additives were employed. Using the aspiration device as a prefilter for adding antibiotics to the infusion fluid resulted in improved flow rates through a 0.45-mum membrane filter for lactated Ringer's containing cephalothin sodium, while for solutions containing ampicillin or oxytetracycline, prefilteration did not change the flow rate profiles.\n",

      "Experiments on the role of virus infections in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. The role of innate or acquired insufficiency or ergotropic adaptation in the mechanism of genesis of bronchial asthma. The wide mosaic of congruent clinical and experimental observations led to the postulation that the cause of the pharmacological abnormality of the asthmatic patient, i.e. the immensely increased reactivity of the bronchial smooth muscles, is to be sought in an insufficiency of the beta-adrenergic receptor system. It is to be assumed that the so-called asthma diatheses is based inter alia on a genetically determined defect of the adenyl cyclase system. The role of previous infections of the respiratory tract in asthmagenesis should lie--following this working theory--not in a sensitization in the sense of an allergic reaction of the immediate type, but in the formation of a defective beta-adrenergic substance or in a blockade of the beta-receptor. A genetically determined innate defect of the beta-adrenergic receptors, or a defect acquired through infections of the respiratory tract, is hence likely to be the cause of the pathologically potentiated reactivity of the bronchia. It is likely that the infective stimuli--quite apart from this preparatory role--are later capable of triggering asthmatic paroxysms when the vegetative homeostasis is impaired. We know from the experiments of many authors that a blockade of the beta-receptors produced by chemical blocker substances, or by pertussis vaccine or various bacterial substances, results in a significant increase in bronchial reactivity towards histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and other stimuli. We have shown in our experiments that heat-inactivated adeno viruses and influenza viruses also increase the anaphylactic shock reactivity and the histamine reactivity of the organism. On the basis of this working hypothesis, the pathomechanism of the asthmatic process is as follows in individual asthma forms: 1) In the 'purely\" allergic asthma form, the antigen-antibody reaction that occurs after sensitization (i.e. formation of skin-sensitizing allergic antibodies of the class IgE) results in re-formation and release of slow-reacting-substances. spasm of the bronchial muscles, asthmatic paroxysm. The expulsion of catecholamines that follows the release of slow-reacting-substances makes a decisive contribution to the reestablishment of the impaired homeostatic balance. It is to be assumed that this form of asthma both symptomatically and causally--using specific desensitization--can be influenced more easily than other forms of asthma with a more complicated pathogenic background. 2) In the second allergically determined form of asthma, we are confronted by the genetically fixed or acquired insufficiency of the beta-receptors in addition to the immunological mechanism. As a result of the innate or acquired blockade of the beta-receptive substance, or the relative dominance of the alpha-receptors, the catecholamines (that physiologically serve to maintain homeostasis) contribute to a protraction, intensification and perpetuation of the bronchial obstruction. In this way the asthmatic circulus vitiosus is complete...\n",
      "Ventilatory response to hypercapnia in the larger spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus stellaris. Dogfish were exposed to sudden changes of Pco2 in inspired seawater. During hypercapnia breathing frequency remained constant, but gill ventilation was transiently increased to about 140% of control levels in the 1st h. O2 uptake was significantly increased also, but returned to the initial level before nomalization of gill ventilation. In contrast to the transient rise in gill ventilation and O2 uptake, arterial Po2 was increased for the whole period of hypercapnia. Hypercapnia results in a marked fall in pHa which returned to the initial value in 4-5 h even though hypercapnia is maintained. This rise in pHa with little change in PaCO2 was associated with an increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration. The increase of plasma bicarbonate was in part due to compensatory bicarbonate uptake from the seawater across the gills and in part was effected by transfer between intracellular tissue compartments and extracellular spaces. The compensatory bicarbonate exchange mechanism in the gills seems to have a delay both after onset and termination of hypercapnia.\n",
      "Does hyperinsulinemia in ob/ob mice cause an insulin-stimulated adipose tissue? After a 1-h preincubation to remove endogenous insulin, adipose tissue of obese mice (C57BL/L4 ob/ob) had a lower rate of glucose metabolism than tissue which was not preincubated. In contrast, preincubation did not change the metabolism of adipose tissue from lean mice (C57B1/6J +/+). The preincubation effect was abolished in obese mice which had had their serum insulin levels lowered toward normal by streptozotocin treatment. Injection of anti-insulin serum to obese mice caused adipose tissue removed 15 min after the injection to display a rate of glucose metabolsim lower than that of tissue removed before the injection. No such effect was seen in lean mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia in the obese mice causes a chronic state of insulin stimulation of their adipose tissue, possibly contributing to their high rates of lipogenesis and their obesity. Several lipogenic enzymes were measured in adipose tissue of both lean and obese mice, and no single enzymatic abnormality was detected which might explain the hyperlipogenesis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were both insulin-sensitive enzymes in lean and obese mice.\n",
      "Importance of pulmonary ventilation in respiratory control in the bullfrog. Pulmonary and cutaneous O2 consumption (Vo2) and CO2 production (Vco2) were measured simultaneously in bullfrogs Rana catesbeiana at 20 degrees C. The lungs were responsible for 77.3-91.0% of the total Vo2 and 28.5-74.9% of the total VCO2. The distribution of the total exchange between the lungs and skin depended on metabolic rate; frogs with higher rates relied more heavily on the pulmonary mode for both Vo2 and Vco2. When prevented from ventilating their lungs in an O2-rich environment, bullfrogs developed severe respiratory acidosis, demonstrating the importance of lung exchange in normal acid-base balance. When frogs were totally submerged in an O2-saturated medium, skin Vco2 increased linearly to a steady-state value which approximated the preapneic total Vco2. In these same animals, arterial Pco2 increased proportionately to the increase in skin Vco2, indicating that skin diffusion capacity for CO2 was unaffected. We conclude that the control of breathing in the bullfrog in response to changes in metabolic rate relies predominantly on changes in lung ventilation while the skin plays a more passive role.\n",
      "Electromyographic response of respiratory muscles during elastic loading. The response of respiratory motor neurons to graded elastic loading was assessed in anesthetized dogs by recording the electromyogram (EMG) from the diaphragm (ED) and the intercostal muscle (EIC). Elastic loads were applied for 1-20 breaths. The effects of changes in PCO2 on respiratory motor neuron output was assessed by applying loads during the course of CO2 rebreathing. On the first loaded breath, ED and EIC increased reflexly due chiefly to prolongation of inspiration. Vagotomy or vagal cooling to block the Hering-Breuer reflex eliminated the increase in ED and diminished the increase in EIC. During the second to fifth breath, the level of EMG activity was disproportionately high for the level of PCO2, suggesting an additional reflex component over and above the reflex activity present on the first loaded breath.\n",

In five conscious dogs with gastric fistula and two duodenal cannulas, plasma RIA secretin and gastrin levels were determined in response to 1) infusion of 0.1 N HCl in the proximal duodenal cannula, 2) ingestion of a meal, and 3) intraduodenal infusion of 0.1 N HCl following ingestion of a meal. Significant increases in plasma RIA secretin levels occurred during duodenal acidification. However, no significant change occurred in the secretin levels after ingestion of a meal, whereas significant increase in plasma gastrin level was observed. Postprandial duodenal pH remained above 4.5 for 3 h.\n",
      "Intracellular pH of brain: alterations in acute respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. To evaluate the metabolic adaptations of the brain to acute respiratory acid-base disturbances, a method was developed to measure intracellular pH (pHi) in the brain of dogs under conditions in which arterial pH is rapidly altered. Brain pHi was determined by measuring the distribution of 14C-labeled dimethadione (DMO) in brain relative to cortical CSF. Brain extracellular space (ECS) was evaluated as the 35SO4 = space relative to cortical CSF, and arterial Po2 was maintained at 82-110 mmHg. In normal dogs, brain (cerebral cortex) pHi was 7.05, and after 1 h of hypercapnia (arterial pH = 7.07) it fell to 6.93. However, after 3 h with arterial Pco2 maintained at 85 mmHg brain pHi was normal (7.06), and during this time brain bicarbonate had risen from 11.3 to 24.4 meq/kg H2O. These changes were not prevented by intravenous doses of acetazolamide,\n",
      "Myocardial CO2 buffering: role of transmembrane transport of H+ or HCO3-ions. Isolated rabbit hearts were perfused with rabbit red cells suspended in Ringer solution. A small volume of perfusate was recirculated for 10 min at Pco2 of 33.4 +/- 0.9 or 150.8 +/- 7.5 mmHg. Hypercapnia resulted in an increase in perfusate HCO3- concentration that was smaller than that observed when isolated perfusate was equilibrated in vitro with the same CO2 tensions (delta HCO-3e = 1.6 mM, P less than 0.01). This difference is consistent with a net movement of HCO3- into or H+ out of the mycardial cell, and cannot be accounted for by dilution of HCO3- in the myocardial interstitium. Recirculation of perfusate through the coronary circulation at normal Pco2 for two consecutive 10-min periods was not followed by changes in perfusate HCO3- concentration. A high degree of correlation (r = 0.81) was observed between intracellular HCO-3e concentration and the corresponding delta HCO-3e in individual experiments. The results suggest that transmembrane  exchange of H+ or HCO3- is a buffer mechanism for CO2 in the myocardial cell.\n",

Cerebroventricular perfusion with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 10(-5) M ouabain was performed in adult dogs in order to describe the time course of the cardiovascular effect of intraventricular ouabain and to evaluate treatments to eliminate the cardiovascular effect. The central effect of ouabain caused a 56% increase in blood pressure above control values and a 35% increase in heart rate with various cardiac arrhythmias. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs given intravenously.altered the pressure and rate effects ou ouabain, whereas vagotomy attenuated the effect.\n",
      "Effect of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade on rat cardiac and skeletal muscle pH. The effect of catecholamines on the intracellular pH of rat cardiac and skeletal muscle during varying extracellular acid-base states was determined. Intracellualr pH (pHi) was calculated from the distribution of [14C]DMO. Acid-base disturbances were produced by placing the animals in an environmental chamber containing 10 or 20% CO2 or by administering HCL or NaHCO3. Two hours later the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and blood and tissue samples obtained. In one series of animals, the effects of catecholamines were attenuated by administering the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist MJ 1999 (Sotalol). In animals breathing 20% CO2, cardiac muscle pH was lower in beta-blocked than unblocked animals (6.69 vs. 6.78). During metabolic acidosis, cardiac muscle pH of beta-blocked animals was lower than that of unblocked animals (6.75 vs. 6.84). The same relationship was observed for skeletal muscle during metabolic acidosis-beta blockade pHi, 6.66; unblocked pHi, 6.77. The pHi of beta-blocked versus unblocked animals was not significantly different under normal acid-base conditions or metabolic alkalosis for cardiac or skeletal muscle. The effective buffer value of both tissue over the normal acidotic range was decreased by the beta-blocking agent. These results indicate that catecholamine release accompanying acidosis attenuates the change in pHI and increases the effective buffer value of cardiac and skeletal muscle.\n",
      "Biliary secretion in elasmobranchs. I. Bile collection and composition. Bile composition and secretion were studied in tow elasmobranch species, Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish shark) and Raja erinacea (small skate), after ligation of the common duct and insertion of cannulas into the gallbladder lumen. Fish were then allowed to swim freely in large pools and bile was collected in balloons attached to the externalized cannulas. Both species secreted bile for periods of 4-7 days at a maximum rate of 1.77 +/- .89 ml/kg per 24 h in Squalus acanthias and 2.66 +/- .89 ml/kg per 24 h in Raja erinacea. Comparison of the composition of cannula and gallbladder bile indicated that hepatic bile could be collected by this technique in both species without effective contact with gallbladder epithelium. The low concentrations of HCO3- and CL- and the gigh bile salt levels in dogfish gallbladder bile indicate that mechanisms for concentration and acidification of bile in the gallbladder developed early in vertebrate evolution. These results indicate that gallbladder cannulation in free-swimming elasmobranchs is a useful technique for the study of bile secretory and excretory function in marine species.\n",

      "[The influence of PaCO2 on oxygen consumption during extracorporeal circulation in hypothermia (author's transl)]. Hypocapnia during extracorporeal circulation in hypothermia increases oxygen consumption. Po2 in mixed venous blood decreases. This probably reflects a decrease in tissue oxygen tension.

      "[Clinical studies on the use of ketalar in obstetric anesthesia (author's transl)]. 26 healthy pregnant women at term were divided into 2 groups and anaesthetized with either 1 mg/kh or 2 mg/kg ketamine - N20/02 - for primary caesarean section. Maternal venous ketamine plasma levels, neonatal ketamine plasma levels (umbilical artery and umbilical vein) and blood gases were measured. Maternal venous ketamine plasma levels in group I exceeded those in group II by 2.8 (30-60 sec after injection) and 2.0 (at the time of delivery) respectively. Independent of the dose used, the plasma levels of ketamine in the umbilical artery or the umbilical vein were found to be identical in the two groups of newborn infants. Neonatal blood gases and acid base parameters did not significantly differ between the two groups, except for the oxygen tension in group II which slightly exceeded the PO2 values in group I 15, 60 and 120 min after delivery. pH and standard bicarbonate values were found to be higher (1 and 5 min) in both groups, compared to pH and standard bicarbonate levels in a group of newborns delivered spontaneously.--The results of this study show: 1. Independent of a low or high ketamine dosage, neonatal blood concentration of the drug remain low, probably due to a placental barrier effect.--2. The post partum recovery of the newborns was neither influenced by the ketamine anesthesia itself nor by different drug doses.\n",
      "Effect of abdominal compression on minute ventilation of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. The effects of manual compression of the upper lateral abdomen (C) of 73 cases of obstructive airway disease were studied in respect to the change in minute ventilation (V) 10 minutes after the procedure was performed. A mean decrease of 13% in V was found in the majority of 15 cases of bronchial asthma or chronic bronchitis and 43 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The use of manual compression as a therapeutic measure depends largely on the abrupt reduction of lung volume in cases of obstructive airway disease in which over-inflation of the lung is present as an acute or chronic disorder. The degree and duration of clinical benefit, i.e., relief of dyspnea, depends on such factors as the volume of air trapped in the lungs, broncho-constriction through pathologic change or bronchospasm and impairment of elastic recoil of the pulmonary parenchyma. The lowered V recorded 10 minutes after C is performed suggests that decrease in dyspnea is associated with enhanced efficiency of ventilation in some subjects with obstructive airway disease, including those with bronchial asthma as well as COLD. A brief description is presented of 10 patients with COLD in whom manual compression and other features of a rehabilitation program were employed. Mean length of life of five living subjects is 12.6 years after beginning of therapy. The mean length of life of five who died was 10.2 years after beginning of treatment.\n",
      "[Accidental peroperative hypothermia during rapid transfusion]. Six cases of grave hypothermias are reported, having arisen during surgical interventions which necessitated a rapid and abundant transfusion of badly warmed blood. The role of favouring factors, surrounding cold due to the air-conditioning, anaesthesia, extent of the area of operation, seems important. The symptomatology permits the individualization of a hypothermic syndrom neighbouring the picture described in toxic accidental hypothermias. Accidents during the warming process associate collapse and disturbances in coagulation. It is therefore necessary to consider certain signs of alarm as important and generalize the conditions for prevention of thermolysis in the operating theatre.\n",

This work aims at determining possible interactions between this product and certain drugs used in anesthesia from the cardiovascular point of view. ISKEDYL does not seem to be a contraindication to anesthesia of the \"neuroleptic\" type, when injected in pre-, per- or post-operative period.

The variations in pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid was studied in 20 patients before and after induction of anesthesia with alfatesine (0.1 ml/Kg). 14 patients received no other complementary drug (group 1); in the six other cases, 1 g. of acetylsalicylic acid was administered as an analgesic complement (group II).

The presence of mannitol in the urine would appear to result from a secondary catabolic through physiological pathway for the fructose produced by the metabolism of sortibol not metabolised during glycolysis.\n",
      "[Clinical evaluation of the new anesthetic \"Ethrane\"]. Seventy-four patients aged 14 months to 71 years, classified as ASA I and II were anesthetised with Ethrane for surgical interventions of mean duration 117 minutes. With the exception of 5 patients who were directly anesthetised with Ethrane, the others received Ethrane after induction with Penthiobarbitone. Maintenance of anesthesia was ensured with 1 to 4p. 100 concentrations of Ethrane and 33p. 100 oxygen and 66p. 100 nitrous oxide. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by injection of 1 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Induction with enflurane is rapid with no phenomena of excitation or irritation of the ear passages. The cardiovascular apparatus is stable with no arrythmia but an increase in heart rate of 11 to 50p. 100 is noted and in 41p. 100 of the cases hypotension of 35p. 100 of the intitial value. During spontaneous ventilation, a type of rapid and superficial respiration is observed with a flow volume of 5.3 ml/kg for an average frequency of 25/min. The arterial blood gases show slight hypercapnia. Myorelaxation is significant and better than that obtained with halothane. Coming round poses few problems apart from agitation in adolescents. Response to simple orders appears at 13 minutes. Trembling and rigidity occur in 41p. 100 of the cases for 5 to 30 minutes. From the hepatic point of view, no lastin enzyme changes were noted and no renal toxicity was demonstrated. Ethrane appears to be a good anesthetic agent but the few advantages mentioned means that it does not fulfil ideal conditions.\n",
      "[A case of acute tobacco poisoning by enema]. The authors report the case of a 5 month old child intoxicated with nicotine through an enema. A mother who wished to treat her infant for constipation had administered to him as an enema a decoction of green tobacco leaves; 15 to 20 minutes after the enema, the child showed diarrhoea and respiratory disturbances. The authors treated the respiratory disturbances by assisted respiration and bradycardia and the diarrhoea with atropine. They also caused a force diuresis using a 10 p. 100 glucose solution and Furosemide.\n",
      "[Hemodynamic effect of enflurane in man]. The following hemodynamic parameters: cardiac frequency, peripheral arterial pressure, pulmonary pressure and cardiac output were measured by direct catheterisation, as the total peripheral vascular resistance and the systolic ejection volume were calculated from the registered results. The cardiac frequency and the pulmonary arterial pressure were practically not modified in our patients, though we have observed a statistically significant decrease of systolic (-30p. 100) and diastolic (-27p. 100) arterial pressure. The total peripheral vascular resistance shows a marked diminution (-20p. 100) after giving Ethrane? for ten minutes. If it is possible that one part, surely important, of the cardiac output, is preserved under Ethrane anesthesia by a significant decrease of the total peripheral vascular resistance, a myocardial depression might be questionned, the decrease of cardiac output at 30 minutes being more important than the decrease of the total peripheral vascular resistance.\n",
      "[Postoperative circulatory arrest (apropos of 37 cases)]. Within five years, the authors received 37 patients who had presented a post-operative cardiac arrest. Most of them came from the Bordeaux district (from the hospital as well as the public sector) although they did not represent the totality of such accidents. The study bears first of all upon the data concerning the patients, then upon the surgical intervention, the mode of anaesthesia and ventilation, the posture and finally the treatment. In 10 cases. it was noted, as early as the admission, that the blood volume feel short of the theoretical total blood volume by one liter or more. The authors take into account how traces of previous affections, the localization in O.R.L., and, in ophthalmology, an important number of mistakes in anaesthesia, favour the progress of the genesis of the accident.\n",

      "[The second electromyographic study of surgical curarization with AH.8165, a new pachycurare derivative of azobis-arylimidazo(1-2a) pyridinium]. This second electromyographic study of AH-8165, a product derived from azobis-arymilidazo-(1-2a) pyridinium, carried out with a special apparatus which both stimulates and records, specifies the characteristics of the neuro-muscular block induced by this new non-depolarizing type curarizing substance while taking into account the usual factors of the curarimimetic variability of action. After an initial dose of 1 mg per kg of bodyweight, we notice particularly: -the lapse of time required for a complete block (90 s), its intensity and duration (normally total during at least one hour) -the morphology of the electromyogram during the curarization and the decurarization either spontaneous or induced by Neostigmin with in particular -the muscular fatigability after repeated stimulation following curarization and chiefly during decurarization, chronological data und electro-myographic aspects which are found as well after a reinjection of AH-8165 equivalent to the half of the previous one.\n",
      "[Contribution to the study of Trive 1000]. A glucid-lipid and protein compound nutriment: Trive 1000 was administered to 53 patients during the first three postoperative days in varying doses: -1.000 ml per day to a first group -1.500 ml per day to a second group. The local tolerance was quite good. However, a few accidents of a general character were noted: they were due to a great extent to a non-observance of the rules of preservation. A study of the glucides, in Sorbitol form, showed a good assimilation of the substratum. Glycemia remaining within normal, no glycosuria or ketonuria could be observed. The assimilation of the proteins seemed on the whole satisfactory. No important rise in the blood urea was noted. Nitrogen balances showed that, thanks to this nutriment, almost half of them were positive during the post-aggressive period. The more important the dose of Trive 1000, the more positive the nitrogen balances were. The administration of lipids did not reveal any significant change in the total lipids, triglycerides or cholesterol. A study of the graphic record of lipid levels showed chylomicrons twice. On the opposite, lipoproteins were hardly modified apart from a significant in pre-beta lipoproteins. The quantitative analysis of amino-acids proved interesting. A comparative study of amino-acids both in blood and urine before and after the administration of Trive 1000 showed very little variations in connection with essential amino-acids. If the proportions in the blood of non-essential amino-acids were comparatively but little modified before and after the treatment, on the oppostie, the urinary clearance rate of the same amino-acids after treatment was far more variable and often quite important as far as certain amino-acids were concerned.\n",
      "[Comparative study of nitrogen savings during enteral and parenteral feeding (Trive 1000)]. Through a study of Nitrogen balances, the authors compare the effectiveness of a proteinic intake carried out per os or by intravenous route. The study involved 22 different carcinoma carriers and lasted for 9 days during which the Nitrogen intake was effected either by the digestive tract or by intravenous route supplemented by a sufficient caloric ration. In the latter case, the aminoacid intake was supplied by Trive 1000 combined with glucides and lipids which were then quantitatively deducted from the enteral intake. A study of the results showed that the assimilation of the Nitrogen injected intravenously was very similar to the one obtained by enteral route.\n",
      "[The utilization of EB 51 in parenteral feeding. Clinical, biological and anatomopathological control. Statistical study on 30 patients]. Two groups of patients (comas of central origin and serious digestive undernourished) were submitted to an exclusive or a supplementary parenteral feeding for a short or a long period of time totaling over 500 days. The catheter was placed (in 80 p. cent of the cases) in a deep vein and was tunnellized. EB 51 (Trivemil) used in those 30 patients gives amino-acids, lipids and glucides. The caloric intake was completed by 30 p. cent glucose solutes. If the average caloric intake was 3.000 calories per day, it was often above that figure since the feeding was combined with a nutri-pump enteral feeding for 60 p. cent of the days. The clinical tolerance was quite good. On a biological level, in addition to classic investigations, 40 analytic graphic records of lipid levels were made, as well as a quantitative analysis of serous triglycerides and lipurias, a study of sorbitol and 500 nitrogen balances combined with 150 chromatographies on the acidaminuria column. An hepatic biological control was also made (amnoniemia, transaminases) as well as a quantitative analysis of lactates, pyruvates and minerals: iron-phosphorus-magnesium. Some of the results were checked by statistical studies. No serious anomaly was detected. Lung and hepatic biopsies carried out upon 9 patients did not apparently reveal any lipidic overloading. The clinical and the biological investigation show that this complete nutriment is perfectly tolerated and assimilated.\n",
      "[Effect of increasing doses of dopamine on the left ventricular function in the dog]. A study on eleven dogs of the effects of increasing doses of dopamine on the left ventricular function. A description of the method which consists of a venous shunt connected to an extra-corporeal circuit and which allows modification simply and rapidly of the state of vascular refilling of the animal. The results differ according to the pressure-level of the refilling of the left ventricule. At low pressure, the dopamine increases the arterial pressure, the cardiac output and the systolic activity of the left ventricle for a reduced tachycardic effect. At higher pressure, the average aortic pressure is only slightly increased and the systolic activity is elevated without increase in cardiac output. These facts indicate dopamine in states of shock with a low pressure of refilling.\n",
      "[The effect of intravenous dopamine on the hemodynamics of the heart]. The pharmacological study of dopamine was conducted on 14 patients: eleven normal patients and three with incipient myocardiopathies. The dosages used were 3, 6 and 12 mug/kg/min. The \"pump\" function, the peripheral resistances, the contractility and the ventricular compliance were studied. Dopamine is a positive inotropic agent without chronotropic action at doses of 6 and 12 mug/kg/min. It acts by increasing the contractility and the venous return and by decreasing the peripheral resistances; this effect disappears with strong dosages.\n",
      "[Hemodynamic study of dopamine used in chronic heart failures and in cardiogenic shock as a complication of acute myocardial infarct]. The object of this study is to examine the properties of dopamine at the hemodynamic and renal level in 16 patients with decompensated chronic cardiopathies or very serious cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction. The results show an increase in the cardiac index in 75 p. 100 of the cases with a favourable diminution of the arterio-venous difference in O2 and of the pulmonary arterial resistances. The most noticeable and the most constant effect is the recovery and increase of the diuresis. Positive chronotropic and bathmotropic effects were observed which necessitated the limitation of prescription of dopamine in those subjects showing signs of disturbances in ventricular excitability.\n",
      "[Studies of the variations in functional renal values induced by intravenous dopamine]. We studied, on six patients, the variations in functional renal value and urinary excretion of electrolytes during the intravenous administration of dopamine and in the hours immediately following. Two groups of patients are distinguished. In groupe I, all of whom had normal functional renal values, there was no modification of these, while we observed increases in output, in excretion of electrolytes and in the clearance of the uric acid. In group II, composed of patients with renal insufficiencies, the modifications are less definite but the diuretic and saluretic effect is present. The salidiuretic effects of the dopamine would seem to be dissociated from the cardiovascular effects.\n",
      "[The use of dopamine during postoperative cardiogenic shock in children. Preliminary results]. Dopamine was used in a dose of 5 mug/kg/min in ten infants with congenital cardiopathy and presenting in the immediate postoperative period a syndrome of low cardiac output.

      "[Use of dopamine in postoperative reanimation after heart surgery. Preliminary results]. The dopamine was used on ten patients having undergone one or several valvular replacements under extra-corporeal circulation. The essential indication was the appearance postoperatively of more or less serious circulatory failure. The dopamine was administered by drip in doses of 2.5, 5 or 10 mug/kg/min. The effects on the frequency of the cardiac rhythm were moderate. On two cases, ventricular hyperexcitability induced by isoprenaline disappeared under dopamine. The chief effects were an increase in cardiac output, in the form of an increase in the volume of systolic ejection and lowering of the peripheral resistances. A steady increase in urinary volume preceded the amelioration of clinical signs of circulatory failure.\n",
      "[Use of dopamine in acute cardiovascular distress. Its place in comparison to isoproterenol]. Nineteen patients presenting cardiovascular distress were treated with dopamine. For seventeen of these, the accident occurred immediately after cardiac surgery. Dosages varied from 1 to 15 mug/kg/min and the duration of treatment from 10 minutes to three days. The efficacy of the treatment was judged according to the clinical and hemodynamic improvement of the cardio-circulatory function and the increase in urinary output. There were 15 favourable results. The positive effects of the dopamine seem to be limited in certain patients by the appearance of a cyanosis testifying to a rise in vascular resistances which increases the left auricular pressure and limits the inotropic effect. In these cases, isoproterenol or a combination of both isoproterenol and dopamine gives better results.\n",
      "[Dopamine and shock. Preliminary clinical study of 7 cases]. Seven patients presenting a state of shock were treated with dopamine. The authors remark an undeniable effect on arterial pressure which rises again and on the diuresis.\n",
      "[Use of dopamine in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. Preliminary results]. A study of seven patients, each of whom was treated with dopamine within three hours after suffering a myocardial infarction. For four of these, a comparative study was made with isoproterenol, glucagon and ouabaine. The average age of the subjects was 72 years, and all presented considerable myocardial lesions before the treatment was begun. Despite improvement, particularly in diuresis and cardiac output, none of the patients survived. The authors explain these results by the fact that, like all powerful inotropic agents, dopamine produces an increase in oxygen consumption of the myocardium for the ischemic cells situated in the zone contiguous to the infarct.\n",

      "[The place of enflurane in neuro-anesthesia]. In neuro-anaesthesia, anaesthetic agents must be in accordance with certain criteria necessary to the preservation of the integrity of the brain. Therefore it was in such a perspective that we re-appraised the effects of enflurane upon cortical irritability, metabolism, cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure. We reached the following conclusions: in normocapnia, and with optimal clinical concentrations, this drug remains the best anaesthetic agent since it has no harmful effect either upon metabolism or upon cerebral blood flow. However, in hypertensive cerebral lesions, caution is called for an it seems advisable to combine Enflurane with mild doses of fentanyl. Finally, anaesthesia with enflurane is followed by a rapid and smooth return to consciousness, a valuable factor in neurosurgery where post-operative neurological watching matters very much.\n",
      "Immunology and microbiology in acute otitis media. Various immunological parameters were measured in serum, middle ear fluid (MEF), and lymphocytes from peripheral blood and MEF of infants with acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Approximately half of 131 patients had IgE specific antibody to the infecting bacterium as determined by the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) technique. Seventy-one percent of these IgE positive patients had IgE specific antibody in the MEF. Total IgE concentration was found to be from an average of 1.5 to 3.0 times higher in the MEF when compared to the simultaneously drawn serum. In addition, antibody to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides and to pneumococcal C-carbohydrate was demonstrated in the MEF by radioimmunoassay. When MEF specific antibody was compared to serum antibody it appeared that antibody to C-carbohydrate was more concentrated in the MEF. That this antibody was of the IgE class was suggested by IFA but not conclusively proven. Evidence exists that conditions for enhanced IgE synthesis is concomitantly associated with a decrease in T-cell activity. T-cell function in MEF derived lymphocytes as determined by rosette formation and by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was approximately one-tenth that of the peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, that T-cells may participate in the immune response to polysaccharides was suggested by the observation that polysaccharide stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from infants immunized with octavalent pneumococcal capsular vaccine underwent protein synthesis two to three times that of the PHA stimulated cells. The clinical significance of this finding as well as the nature of the cell responsible for the increased protein synthesis remains to be established. It is hypothesized that acute otitis media results from local synthesis of bacteria specific IgE antibody which is enhanced by a paucity of local T-cell activity.\n",

A total of 175 effusions obtained from 172 patients suffering from chronic otitis media with effusions was examined for bacterial smear and culture. Eighty percent showed positive bacterial smear, but only 49% yielded positive bacterial culture. The mucoid effusions had positive cultures in only 37%, whereas the bacterial culture rate was higher in serous (59%) and leukocytic (64%) types. The isolation of common pathogens accounted for about 50% of the isolates, and nonpathogens accounted for the remaining 50%. The high incidence of microorganisms in the middle ear effusions in the present series raises the possibility of bacterial contribution in many cases of OME.\n",

Some methodological problems in clinical enzymology, including instability of enzymes in the incubation mixture and requirements for optimal reaction conditions, are highlighted. The importance of a knowledge of fundamental enzyme biochemistry and physiology as the basis for their diagnostic application is stressed, and the different behaviour of some hepatic enzymes--namely, GOT, GPT, gamma-GT, and OCT, in various pathological conditions is traced back to their characteristic biochemical and physiological properties. In the field of urinary enzymes a knowledge of the ideal requirements for the enzyme investigation of the various renal functions and of the properties of potentially valuable enzymes permits a critical selection of the really useful ones.\n",

      "[Properties of penicillin amidase covalently bound to cellulose matrices]. Properties of penicillinamidase (PA) covalently bound with the cellulose matrix were studied. The efficiency of the binding depended on the bind type and purity of the native enzyme taken for binding. Stability of the immobilized PA (IPA) was studied at wide pH ranges. The effect of the ion strength, substrate concentration and purity of the native PA on stability of IPA was also investigated. The maximum stability of the enzyme was observed at pH 6.5-7.0 Stability of IPA depended on the purity of the native enzyme. When PA of the diazotized ether of cellulose containing amino groups was used, the enzyme was destabilized. IPA prepared on chlortriazinylcellulose was more stable than the respective native PA almost by I order.\n",

Variation diagrams were proposed to be used for the analysis of the published data on the study of Vibrio cholerae sensitivity to tetracycline. The diagrams provided systematization of dissimilar data of the experimental studies and a unique system of estimation was created. The analysis of the systematized data provided dividing of the Vibrio cholerae strains tested into 4 groups differing in the levels of their sensitivity to tetracycline. The groups were independent of the Vibrio cholerae biotypes and the place and period of the strain isolation.\n",
      "[Toxicological characteristics of ampicillin]. Toxocity of ampicillin trihydrate was studied in acute and chronic experiments. It was shown that the antibiotic had low acute toxicity, did not cumulate and had no skin-irritating effect. On its inhalation in concentrations of 5 mg/m3 for 4 months, ampicillin induced allergization of albino rats, decreased their immunity. The general toxic effect of the drug was slightly pronounced. Ampicillin in a concentration of 0.1 mg/m3 induced tension of the immunological reactivity of the organism. The maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of ampicillin in the working premises equal to 0.1 mg/m3 is recommended. Mark \"Allergen\" is necessary.\n",
      "Susceptibility of pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae to antibacterial agents. Strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were tested for susceptibility to numerous antibiotics by a twofold agar dilution method using an inocula replicator. Undiluted, fully grown broth cultures were used as inocula for both species, and cultures of pneumococci diluted 1:1,000 were also tested. The antibiotics included most of those in common use in the United States as well as some chemical modifications recently approved and others that are under investigation. The most striking aspect of the results was the marked susceptibility of the pneumococci to all the antibiotics tested except the polymyxins and most of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, although some new aminoglycosides were active in quite low concentrations. Some of the strains of pneumococci were of decreased susceptibility to penicillin G (minimal inhibitory concentrations, 0.2 to 0.4 mug/ml), but none were tetracycline resistant, although such strains had been reported previously from this laboratory. The strains of H. influenzae, which were all serologically nontypable, exhibited different patterns of susceptibility to the groups of antibiotics and to the individual chemically related ones. None of these strains (isolated early in 1972) were ampicillin resistant. The most active agents against H. influenzae were: carbenicillin and ampicillin, analogues related to each of them, rifampin, chloramphenicol, and the polymyxins. However, the tetracycline analogues other than tetracycline, some aminoglycosides, notably tobramycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and verdamicin, erythromycin, and some new lincomycin analogues were also active in low concentrations. Trimethoprim alone was highly active, and in combination with sulfamethoxazole it was even more active and synergistic against strains of both D. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.\n",
      "Comparative incidence of phlebitis due to buffered cephalothin, cephapirin, and cefamandole. Buffered cephalothin, cefamandole, and cephapirin were compared with respect to their tendency to produce phlebitis. Two grams of each agent was administered every 6 h for 4 days to 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind crossover fashion. Approximately 50% of intravenous sites developed mild (grade 1) phlebitis and 25% developed moderate (grade 2) phlebitis. The frequency of grade 1 inflammation did not differ significantly among the three cephalosporins. The proportion of individuals eventually exhibiting grade 2 phelebitis was highest with cefamandole, lowest with cephalothin (P = 0.07), and intermediate with cephapirin; however, cephapirin required a substantially greater number of doses to produce grade 2 phelebitis than did the other two drugs. These findings, together with the results of other reports, suggest that interpretation of the phlebitogenic potential of these antibiotics must be made with caution.\n",
      "Citric acid metabolism in hetero- and homofermentative lactic acid bacteria. The effect of citrate on production of diacetyl and acetoin by four strains each of heterofermentative and homofermentative lactic acid bacteria capable of utilizing citrate was studied. Acetoin was quantitatively the more important compound. The heterofermentative bacteria produced no acetoin or diacetyl in the absence of citrate, and two strains produced traces of acetoin in its presence. Citrate stimulated the growth rate of the heterofermentative lactobacilli. Acidification of all heterofermentative cultures with citric acid resulted in acetoin production. Destruction of accumulated acetoin appeared to coincide with the disappearance of citrate. All homofermentative bacteria produced more acetoin and diacetyl in the presence of citrate than in its absence. Citrate utilization was begun immediately by the streptococci but was delayed until at least the middle of the exponential phase in the case of the lactobacilli.\n",
      "Influence of specific growth rate on biomass yield, productivity, and compostion of Candida utilis in batch and continuous culture. Candida utilis was grown in batch and continuous culture on prickly pear juice as sole carbon and energy source. In batch culture the maximum specific growth rate (mum) and the substrate yield coefficient (Yps) varied according to sugar concentration. When the fermentation was carried out with 1% sugar, mum and Ys were 0.47/h and 42.6%, respectively. The best yields occurred in a chemostat at the pH range of 3.5 to 4.5 and temperature of 30 C. A beneficial effect on Ys was observed when the dilution rate (D) was increased. At a D of 0.55/h, the productivity was 2.38 g/liter per h. The maintenance coefficient attained a value of 0.09 g of sugar/g of biomass per h. Increases of D produced higher protein contents of the biomass. The information obtained indicates that protein production with Candida utilis, using prickly pear juice, should be carried out a high dilution rates where the Ys and protein content of the cell mass are also higher.\n",
      "Chemical manipulation of the heat resistance of Clostridium botulinum spores. The chemical forms of Clostridium botulinum 62A and 213B were prepared, and their heat resistances were determined in several heating media, including some low-acid foods. The heat resistance of C. botulinum spores can be manipulated up and down by changing chemical forms between the resistant calcium form and the sensitive hydrogen form. The resistant chemical form of type B spores has about three times the classical PO4 resistance at 235 F (112.8 C). As measured in peas and asparagus, both types of C. botulinum spores came directly from the culture at only a small fraction of the potential heat resistance shown by the same spores when chemically converted to the resistant form. The resistant spore form of both types (62A and 213B), when present in a low-acid food, can be sensitized to heating at the normal pH of the food.\n",
      "Poliovirus survival and movement in a sandy forest soil. Movement of poliovirus I (Chat) through nonsterile core samples of a sandy forest soil was monitored, using several regimens of loading with either dechlorinated final effluent from an operating activated sludge treatment plant or distilled water. Stimulated cycles of rainfall and effluent applications, resulting in ionic gradients, were shown to affect virus movement. Such studies indicate that poliovirus applied in effluents may move considerable distances through this soil after rainfall. Survival of poliovirus in the soil at 4 and 20 C has been monitored for 84 days. During this period, the capacity of the virus to migrate is unchanged.\n",
      "Surface balance study of the interaction between microorganisms and lipid monolayer at the air/water interface. Using the surface balance technique, we have compared the interaction between Acholeplasma laidlawii and some marine bacteria towards different types of monolayered lipid films. Cells from A. laidlawii and Serratia marinorubra penetrate the film, whereas cells from Psuedomonas fluorescens form a  layer underneath the film. The forces that bind microorganisms to the air/water interface are not strong enough to scatter a condensed monolayer but increase the strength of loosely packed monolayers.\n",
      "Toxicity of natural pyrethrins and five pyrethroids to fish. The toxicity of natural pyrethrins and five pyrethroids was determined with coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), channel catfish (Icatlurus punctatus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The 96-hour LC50's in static tests at 12 degrees C ranged from 24.6 to 114 mug/l of natural pyrethrins and from 0.110 to 1,140 mug/l of pyrethroids. Two pyrethroids, RU-11679 and SBP-1382 (R), were over 10 times more toxic than pyrethrum extract in the flow-through tests. Coldwater species of fish were more sensitive than warmwater species to all the compunds. Temperature (12-22 degrees C) influences the toxicity of natural pyrethrin and the pyrethroids. The natural pyrethrin was more toxic to fish in pH 6.5 than in pH 9.5 water, but the toxicity of pyrethroids was not influenced in the pH range. The two most toxic pyrethroids, RU-11679 and SBP-1382, Were deactivated more rapidly in water solutions than natural pyrethrins, S-bioallethrin, dimethrin, and d-trans allethrin.\n",
      "Acute toxicity of selenium dioxide to freshwater fishes. Acute toxicity tests of selenium dioxide were conducted for 96 to 336 hr in intermittent-flow bioassay systems using six species of freshwater fish. The decreasing order of species sensitivity was: fathead minnow, flagfish, brook trout, channel catfish, goldfish, and bluegil. Curves relating median lethal concentration to exposure time for each species exposed for more than 168 hr were sigmoid in shape and were characterized by a change in slope indicating a more rapid mortality rate after 96 to 168 hr toxicant exposure. The 96-hr LC50 estimates ranged from 2.9 mg/L SeO2 for fathead minnow fry to 40.0 mg/L for bluegill juveniles. Effects of brief toxicant exposure (24 hr) on fathead minnow and flagfish juveniles included limited delayed mortality and no effects on growth over a 28-day period.\n",
      "Effect of alpha and beta adrenergic blockade on epinephrine induced pulmonary insufficiency. Recent studies demonstrated that epinephrine causes significant pulmonary A-V shunting. This study reports the effect of alpha and beta adrenergic blockade on this shunting. Sixty-three anesthetized mongrel dogs were ventilated with a mechanical respirator. Measurements of (1) the pulmonary shunt, (2) cardiac output, (3) mean pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge and systemic pressures, and (4) pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were obtained at 5, 15 and 30 minute intervals during the first hour and hourly for 5 hours. Fifteen dogs received no treatment. All others received epinephrine hydrochloride, 2 mug/kg/min for 5 hours. Ten received epinephrine only. Ten were pretreated with propranolol hydrochloride, 250 mug/kg, 12 with phenoxybenzamine, 1 mg/kg, and 16 with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Propranolol significantly decreased the epinephrine induced pulmonary shunt at all times and was the most effective drug. Phenoxybenzamine decreased the early shunting, but less than propranolol, and did not decrease the late shunting. Blockade with propranolol and phenoxybenzamine was less effective than propranolol alone. Based on the observed hemodynamic changes it was suggested that beta blockade is effective in reducing epinephrine induced pulmonary insufficiency by favorably altering the flow and distribution of pulmonary blood flow which in turn decreases epinephrine induced ventilation-perfusion inequalities and capillary hypertension both of which result in shunting. Conversely phenoxybenzamine has an unfavorable effect on the pulmonary flow. These studies support previous work in animals and man which showed that beta adrenergic stimulation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary insufficiency. Because the amounts of epinephrine used produce blood levels observed in critical illness, these studies add support to a relationship between the increased catecholamine stimulation of critical illness and the associated and often unexplained pulmonary insufficiency.\n",
      "Revascularization of the heart through the coronary veins. Fifty-six dogs were used in a study to evaluate perfusion of the left anterior descending vein by the internal mammary artery in hearts with normal coronary arteries and those with ligated desending coronary arteries. Perfusion of the myocardium with arterial blood through the cardiac veins offers minimal immediate protection from infarction, as evidenced by light and electron microscopy studies. This protection is of short duration due to intimal fibrosis and luminal stenosis or obstruction of the perfused veins. Nineteen animals in which the coronary vein was perfused and the corresponding coronary artery was not ligated died within sixty hours from the time of operation. Pathological examination revealed patent grafts in all the animals. There was marked congestion of the myocardium with petechial hemorrhages over the surface of the heart. No evidence of myocardial infarction was found.\n",
      "Dirofilaria immitis (dog heartworm) as a pulmonary lesion in humans. Dirofilaria immitis, the dog heartworm, has been identified in the pulmonary granulomas of 5 patients from the greater Charleston area; this is the largest series of such cases from one medical center. The patients had no pulmonary symptoms. On roentgenogram the lesions were all about 2 cm in size, of uniform light opacity, and located near the pleural surface. Thoractomy was performed in each instance because of the possiblity of carcinoma. The association of granuloma formation, pulmonary infarct, and eosinophilic infiltration led to the suspicion of dirofilaria, which was confirmed in each case.\n",
      "Benorylate interaction with indomethacin and phenylbutazone. The simlutaneous oral administration of benorylate (4-(acetamido) phenyl 2-acetoxybenzoate) with either indomethacin or phenylbutazone to rats suffering from Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis leads to an anti-inflammatory effect which is significantly greater than the effect of the same drugs administered alone. Such an additive anti-inflammatory effect is not apparent when the metabolites of benorylate (paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid) are administered with indomethacin or phenylbutazone. Paracetamol does not increase the anti-inflammatory effect of indomethacin or phenylbutazone and acetylsalicylic acid clearly antagonizes it. The molecule of benorylate itsel is therefore responsible for the additive anti-inflammatory effect. However, if antipyretic activity (yeast-induced hyperthermia) is examined instead of anti-inflammatory activity, the simultaneous oral administration of the different drugs always produces an additive effect. It is concluded that the antagonism between indomethacin or phenylbutazone and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than benorylate is present at some receptors but not all. The clinical implications of the results are discussed.\n",
      "A controlled trial of amantadine in drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders. Presently marketed antiparkinsonism drugs are potent anticholinergic agents that, while effective in treating extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), also are productive of or can exacerbate a number of side effects associated with psychotropic drugs. Some of these include gastrointestinal disturbances, visual difficulties, and tardive dyskinesia. A double-blind study was carried out to assess the efficacy (and adverse effects) of amantadine hydrochloride--an agent without appreciable anticholinergic activity--for the treatment of drug-induced EPS. Amantadine was found to be comparable in effect to benztropine mesylate, but with fewer side effects. The potential role of amantadine may be in the treatment of patients with drug-induced EPS for whom medication with anticholinergic properties is contraindicated.\n",
      "Metabolism and ultrastructure in ovaries of alloxan-diabetic juvenile rats. Tests were carried out on the influence of alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus on the metabolism and the ultrastructure of ovaries of juvenile rats. The diabetes mellitus caused the following changes in the metabolism: reduction in the concentration of ATP and NADPH, increase in the lactate/pyruvate quotient to above 40, reduction in the ATP/ADP quotient to below 1, reduction in the level of activity of the hydrogen-conveying enzymes G-6-P-dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, increase in the level of activity of the alkaline phosphatase, reduction of the protein content. Ultrastructure: almost complete disappearance of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, shrinkage of the mitochondria, reduction of the cristae and condensation of the matrix. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum remains unchanged, the extent of the Golgi-complex is reduced. Easy removal of the lipid deposits.\n",
      "Human tear pH. Diurnal variations. Using a closed chamber microelectrode system, the tear pH levels of sixteen subjects were monitored throughout the waking extent of five days. In addition to the absolute mean pH differences found among subjects, diurnal patterns of pH change could be identified for the majority. The amplitudes and periods of these cycloid patterns, however, were distinctive to each individual. Also, tear pH levels following periods of prolonged eye closure were found to be notably more acid than those associated with the waking hours.\n",
      "Reactivity and ionization constants of the lysine residues in apovitellenin i of emu egg yolk low-density lipoprotein by competitive labelling. Competitive labelling with[14C]acetic anhydride over a range of pH values has been used to explore the surface topography of the apovitellenin I moiety in emu egg yolk low-density lipoprotein. The reaction of the lysine  xi-amino groups with acetic anhydride has been related to pH in a set of titration curves; from these, the reactivities relative to alanine and the ionization constants of all but the amino terminal lysines have been determined. All lysines have near normal pKa values around 10, and lower than normal reactivities (except the amino terminal lysine). At pH values above 10, the titration curves show breaks where the epsilon-amino groups become much more reactive, except for lysine 71 which in this regard behaves like a normally ionizing lysine in not showing a discontinuity. Most of the basic residues in this apoprotein may occur clustered at the surface of the molecule. This accounts best for the observed low reactivities and pKa values. The amino terminal lysine residue is presumably completely exposed to the aqueous environment.\n",
      "Properties and specificity of a second metal chelator-sensitive proteinase in the keratinolytic larvae of the webbing clothes moth. The properties of a second metal chelator-sensitive proteinase (metalloproteinase 2) from the larvae of the webbing clothes moth, Tineola bisselliella, have been studied. The pH optimum for casein digestion was 9-4 and the enzyme showed high stability between pH 8 and 11, but very poor stability at acid pH. The proteinase was inhibited by EDTA, but not by an EDTA-calcium complex. EDTA inhibition could be reversed by addition of a slight excess of calcium or zinc ions. The cleavage specificity of metalloproteinase 2 against the A and B chains of S-carboxymethyl insulin was almost identical to that found previously for metalloproteinase 1.\n",
      "Aminopeptidases in webbing clothes moth larvae. properties and specificities of enzymes of highest electrophoretic mobility. The group of aminopeptidase bands from Tineola bisselliella larvae with highest electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels were purified further and partially separated by ion exchange chromatography. Three aminopeptidase bands were present in this material and were very similar with respect to their pH optima (7-7), their molecular weight of 94,000, their responses to metal ions and enzyme inhibitors and in their substrate specificity requirements. Kinetic constants were obtained for the hydrolysis of 17 different alpha-aminoacyl-beta-naphthylamides by these aminopeptidases, the most favoured substrates being the derivatives of alanine, methionine, proline, leucine, glycine, glutamic acid, lysine and arginine. The enzymes also hydrolyse amino acid amides, dipeptides, dipeptide amides, tripeptides and oligopeptides at the N-terminal end. These enzymes differ from the other aminopeptides in T. bisselliella in being able to hydrolyse bonds involving proline.\n",
      "Anti-leukaemia activity as a bystander effect of graft-versus-host reactions. The production of graft-versus-host (GVH) reactions in (PVGc X Wistar) F1 hybrids by the transfer of PVGc spleen cells resulted in significant resistance of these recipients to a subsequent challenge with the PVGc leukaemia. Protection was markedly dependent on dose and timing of allogeneic cell transfer and was abrogated by irradiation of the cells prior to transfer. GVH activity was shown to be a prerequisite for induction of the protective effect but was equally effective when produced by the transfer of Wistar spleen cells in place of PVGc cells. These points, plus the fact that invitro investigations of possible immune mechanisms failed to demonstrate cytotoxic immunity in treated rats, suggested a nonspecific \"bystander\" effect as the mechanism of protection. The implications of such a mechanism are discussed.\n",
      "The effect of aflatoxins on the incorporation of RNA and protein precursors by isolated hepatocytes. Hepatocytes prepared by a simplified enzymatic technique were active in the incorporation of RNA and protein precursors into acid-insoluble material. The incorporation of RNA precursors was very markedly inhibited by low levels of aflatoxin B1 and G1 but not by aflatoxins B2 and G2. The activity of mixed function oxidases (MFO), the drug-metabolizing system of the endoplasmic reticulum, could be suppressed in these cells by SKF525A or stimulated by NADPH. SKF525A caused a reduction in the inhibition by aflatoxin B1 of the incorporation of RNA precursor into macromolecules. This finding suggests that a metabolite of aflatoxin B1 is the actual inhibitor of RNA synthesis in the cells. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity showed these cells to be leaky on incubation at 37 degrees C and thus not suitable for studies of protein secretion.\n",
      "Passive serum sickness in the mouse: the role of vasoactive amines in glomerular deposition of immune complexes. This paper reports a study of the importance of vasoactive amines in glomerular localization of passively administered immune complexes in the mouse. Two strains of mice were investigated, one sensitive and the other relatively resistant to the anaphylactogenic effect of intravenously administered immune complexes. The effect on glomerular deposition immune complexes in animals of both strains treated with either vasoactive amine depletors or antagonists leads to the conclusion that in this experimental system vasoactive amines do not play a major part in the glomerular localization of immune complexes.\n",
      "Intensive care of the fetus in breech labour. A review of 186 cases of breech presentation with a corrected perinatal mortality rate of 0-54 per cent is presented. Details of paediatric follow-up are given. Careful selection of patients for vaginal delivery and the liberal use of Caesarean section are advocated. The importance of asphyxia as the main danger of breech delivery is emphasized and the use of fetal blood sampling as a practicable method of detecting early asphyxia is discussed.\n",
      "The effects of grass and concentrate diets on the specific activities of some enzymes of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in sheep. Feeding sheep a concentrate diet compared with grass diets increased the hepatic specific activities of the three glycolytic enzymes studied, and that of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and reduced the specific activity of D-fructose-I, 6-diphosphate I-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.11). The specific activities of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.43) and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.40) were unaffected by diet.\n",
      "Light-induced glutamate transport in Halobacterium halobium envelope vesicles. II. Evidence that the driving force is a light-dependent sodium gradient. Illumination of cell envelope vesicles from H. halobium causes the development of protonmotive force and energizes the uphill transport of glutamate. Although the uncoupler, p-trifluoromethoxycarbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and the membrane-permeant cation, triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+), are inhibitory to the effect of light, the time course and kinetics of the production of the energized state for transport, and its rate of decay after illumination, are inconsistent with the idea that glutamate accumulation is driven directly by the protonmotive force. Similarities between the light-induced transport and the Na+-gradient-induced transport of glutamate in these vesicles suggest that the energized state for the amino acid uptake in both cases consists of a transmembrane Na+ gradient (Na+out/Na+in greater than 1). Rapid efflux of 22Na from the envelope vesicles is induced by illumination. FCCP and TPMP+ inhibit the light-induced efflux of Na+ but accelerate the post-illumination relaxation of the Na+ gradient created, suggesting electrogenic antiport of Na+ with another cation, or electrogenic symport with an anion. The light-induced protonmotive force in the H. halobium cell envelope vesicles is thus coupled to Na+ efflux and thereby indirectly to glutamate uptake as well.\n",
      "Physical studies of the nonhistone chromosomal proteins HMG-U and HMG-2. The nonhistone chromosomal proteins, HMG-1 and HMG-2, have a folded conformation, with a high alpha-helical content, over a wide pH range. At high and low pH values, the molecules unfold. Both molecules contain cysteine and tryptophan. The tryptophans appear to be buried in the folded form. HMG-1 shows aggregation at pH 5.7, as does HMG-2 at pH 9.0. The folded form is insensitive to high concentrations of salt, suggesting that charge-charge interaction plays no role in stabilizing the tertiary structure.\n",
      "Synthesis and properties of carbonylbis(methionyl)insulin, a proinsulin analogue which is convertible to insulin by cyanogen bromide cleavage. The preparation and use of carbonylbis (L-methionine p-nitrophenyl ester) as a reversible cross-linking reagent for insulin are described. The reaction of 1 equiv of reagent with zinc insulin in dimethylformamide in the presence of triethylamine yields as one of the products NalphaA1, NepsilonB29-carbonylbis(methionyl)insulin, (CBM-insulin). The CBM-insulin was characterized by end group analysis and by the products formed on tryptic and chymotryptic cleavage. It possessed 91% of the immunological and 6.5% of the hormonal activity of insulin. Treatment of CBM-insulin with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) in 70% formic acid for 1 h resulted in nearly complete removal of the methionine bridge to yield insulin. A small amount of a side product was removed on DEAE-cellulose at pH 7.2 to give an overall recovery of insulin of 70-80%. Oxidative sulfitolyses of CBM-insulin gave the hexa(S-sulfonate) which was reduced with dithiothreitol to yield reduced CBM-insulin. The latter compound, containing 6 sulfhydryls, exhibited a pH-dependent circular dichroic spectrum. The form at pH 10 exhibited a spectrum typical of random coil which was converted to a form at pH 7.8 which was characterized by a negative extremum at 213 nm. The change in the spectrum at 213 nm with pH was characterized by an apparent pKa of 8.5. Studies on the reoxidation of reduced CBM-insulin were performed at pH values between 7.8 and 10 and at protein concentrations of 0.01-1 mg/ml. The best yields (ca. 85%) of the correctly paired disulfide bonds were obtained in reoxidations at pH 9.5-10 at protein concentration of 0.01-0.1 mg/ml. CBM-insulin, which had been isolated from reoxidation at high pH of the reduced CBM-insulin, was cleaved by CNBr to yield a fully active insulin in an overall yield of 60% from the reduced CBM-insulin.\n",
      "DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the thermophilic bacterium Caldariella acidophila. Purification and basic properties of the enzyme. A DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been isolated from Caldariella acidophila, a thermophilic bacterium living in acidic hot springs at temperatures ranging from 63 to 89 degrees C. The enzyme was purified 180-fold and is composed of five different subunits having the following molecular weights: a = 127000, b = 120000, c = 72000, d = 65000, and e = 38000. The enzyme is activated by Mn2+ and Mg2+ and exhibits optimal activity in the presence of 0.5 mM Mn2+. The activity depends on ionic strength, with a maximum at 0.25 M KCl, and exhibits a pH optimum at 7.8 in the presence of Tris-HCl buffer. The enzyme shows a high degree of thermophilicity, its temperature optimum being 80 degrees C in the in vitro assay. The thermophilicity of C. acidophila RNA polymerase allows studies on enzyme-template interactions to be performed in a temperature range where many templates are close to their Tm.\n",
      "Induction of stable protein-deoxyribonucleic acid adducts in Chinese hamster cell chromatin by ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet (uv)-light-mediated formation of protein-DNA adducts in Chinese hamster cell chromatin was investigated in an attempt to compare chromatin alterations induced in vitro with those observed in vivo. Three independent methods of analysis indicated stable protein-DNA associations: (1) a membrane filter assay which retained DNA on the filter in the presence of high salt-detergent; (2) a Sepharose 4B column assay in which protein eluted cincident with DNA; and (3) a CsCl density gradient equilibrium assay which showed both protein and DNA banding at densities other than their respective native densities. Treatment of the irradiated chromatin with DNase provided further evidence that protein-DNA and not protein-protein adducts were being observed in the column assay. There is a fluence-dependent response of protein-DNA adduct formation when the chromatin is irradiated at low ionic strength and is linear for protein over the range studied. When the chromatin is exposed to differing conditions of pH, ionic strength, or divalent metal ion concentration, the quantity of adduct formed upon uv irradiation varies. Susceptibility to adduct formation can be partially explained in terms of the condensation state of the chromatin and other factors such as rearrangement, denaturation, and dissociation of the chromatin components. Besides providing information on the biological significance of these types of uv-induced lesions, this technique may be useful as a probe of chromatin structure.\n",
      "D-Mannitol dehydrogenase from Absidia glauca. Purification, metabolic role, and subunit interactions. When Absidia glauca was grown in minimal media with D-mannitol as the only source of carbon, an NAD+ specific D-mannitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.67) was induced. The crude extract also gave evidence of mannitol kinase, mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, and L-iditol dehydrogenase activity. The heat labile purified preparation was judged enzymically homogeneous based on evidence derived from substrate specificity studies and activity staining, following disc gel electrophoresis. The enzymic monomer, with a weight of about 67000 daltons, slowly polymerizes when stored at -20 degrees C, giving a multiplicity of protein bands on electrophoresis distributed predominantly across a spectrum from dimer to pentamer, with enzymic activity resident predominantly in even multiples of the monomer. Depolymerization occurred rapidly (hours) when a frozen preparation was brought to and held between 4 and 20 degrees C. Aggregate fragmentation with sodium dodecyl sulfate showed a time-temperature dependence, terminating in a subunit component of 13000 daltons. pH optimum for polyol oxidation occurs at 9.6 (NaOH-glycine buffer) while ketose reduction proceeded most rapidly at pH 7.0-7.2 (phosphate buffer). A regulatory role is suggested for this enzyme based on dead-end inhibition by mannitol 1-phosphate, multiple enzyme forms, and its locus at the initiation site for mannitol utilization. The physiological relevance of low-temperature aggregation to regulatory control remains to be established.\n",
      "Glutamine synthetase of Bacillus stearothermophilus. Regulation, site interactions, and functional information. The action of various feedback modifiers on Bacillus stearothermophilus glutamine synthetase has been investigated by initial velocity kinetics, using the Mn2+-stimulated biosynthetic assay at 55 degrees C. The most potent inhibitors, used singly, are AMP, L-glutamine, and L-alanine. Other modifiers of significance include glycine, CTP, L-histidine, glucosamine 6-phosphate, and GDP. Marked synergism of action is observed for AMP in the presence of L-glutamine, L-histidine, ADP, or glucosamine 6-phosphate (glucosamine-6-P), and for CTP with ADP or GDP. Inhibition by saturating levels of many modifiers is either less than 100%, or is not overcome by elevated substrate levels, or both. This argues for modifier binding sites separate from substrate sites, notably in the cases of AMP, L-glutamine, glycine, L-alanine, glucosamine-6-P, and CTP. Glycine and L-alanine are Vmax inhibitors, whereas L-glutamine, glucosamine-6-P, GDP, and CTP alter the binding of L-glutamate. ADP and L-histidine apparently can compete directly with MnATP, but AMP alters Mn-ATP binding from a separate site. The action of several modifiers requires or is enhanced by bound substrates. Considerable antagonistic interaction is observed in experiments with modifier pairs, but the most potent inhibitors show synergistic or cumulative (independent) interactions. One may interpret antagonistic effects as due to (a) overlapping modifier domains, or (b) separate but antagonistically interacting sites. Either interpretation leads to a scheme for modifier-substrate and modifier-modifier site interactions in which the thermophilic enzyme must maintain and stabilize a great deal of complex functional information under extreme environmental conditions.\n",
      "Mechanistic studies of glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli: kinetics of ADP and orthophosphate binding to the unadenylylated enzyme. The kinetics of protein fluorescence change exhibited by ADP or orthophosphate addition to the Mg2+-or Mn2+-activated unadenylylated glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli were studied. The kinetic patterns of these reactions are incompatible with a simple bimolecular binding process and a mechanism which required protein isomerization prior to substrate binding. They are consistent with a mechanism in which direct substrate binding is followed by a substrate-induced conformational change step, ES in equilibrium ES. At pH 7.0 and 15 degrees C, the association constants for the direct binding (K1) of ADP to MnE1.0 and of Pi to MnE1.0ADP are 3.9 X 10(4) and 2.28 X 10(2) M(-1), respectively. The association constant for the direct binding of ADP to MnE1.0Pi is 2.3 X 10(4) M(-1) at pH 7.0 and 19 degrees C. The deltaG degrees for the substrate-induced conformational step are -3.5 and -1.3 kcal mol(-1) due to ADP binding to MnE1.0Pi and MnE1.0, respectively, and -1.4 kcal mol(-1) due to Pi binding to MnE1.0ADP. Rate constants, k2 and k(-2), for the isomerization step are: 90 and 9.5 s(-1) for ADP binding to MnE1.0, 440 and 0.36 s(-1) for ADP binding to MnE1.0Pi, and 216 and  1.8 s(-1) for Pi binding to MnE1.0ADP. Due to low substrate affinity, the association constant for direct Pi binding to MnE1.0 was roughly estimated to be 230 M(-1) and k2 = 750 s(-1), k(-2) = 250 s(-1). At 9 degrees C and pH 7.0, the estimated association constants for the direct ADP binding to MgE1.0 and MgE1.0 Pi are 1.8 X 10(4) and 1.6 X 10(4) M(-1), respectively; and the rate constants for the isomerization step associated with the corresponding reaction are k2 = 550 s(-1), k(-2) = 500 s(-1), and k2 = 210 s(-1), k(-2) = 100 s(-1). From the kinetic analysis it is evident that the inability of Mn2+ to support biosynthetic activity of the unadenylylated enzyme is due to the slow rate of ADP release from the MnE1.0PiADP complex. In contrast the large k(-2) obtained for ADP release from the MgE1.0ADP or MgE1.0PiADP complex indicates that this step is not rate limiting in the biosynthesis of glutamine since the k catalysis obtained under the same conditions is 7.2 s(-1).\n",
      "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate linked isocitrate dehydrogenase. Catalytic activation by the reduced coenzyme product of the reaction. The oxidative decarboxylation of D-isocitrate catalyzed by NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase is activated by NADPH, the product of the reaction. We analyzed the autocatalytic behavior exhibited by the enzyme during the steady-state kinetics. NADP acts as a competitive inhibitor toward NADPH in the catalytic activation. In a large concentration range of the reduced and oxidized coenzymes, the activity of the enzyme is proportional to the ratio (NADPH)/(NADP). The results are compared with the results of experiments done with other NADP-linked decarboxylating dehydrogenases. Two different models are presented in order to explain the mechanism of action of isocitrate dehydrogenase, according to our data.\n",
      "Role of mannosyl lipid intermediate in the synthesis of Neurospora crassa glycoproteins. Particulate membrane preparations from Neurospora crassa incorporated mannose from GDP-[14C] mannose into endogenous lipid and particulate protein acceptors. Synthesis of the mannosyl lipid is reversible in the presence of GDP. Chemical and chromatographic characterization of the mannosyl lipid suggest that it is a mannosylphosphorylpolyisoprenol. The other endogenous acceptor was precipitated by trichloracetic acid. Gel filtration and electrophoresis studies before and after treatment with proteolytic enzymes indicate that the second acceptor is a glycoprotein(s). beta Elimination studies on the mannosyl protein formed from GDP-[14C] mannose with Mg2+ in the reaction mixture or formed from mannosyl lipid indicate thad with the peptide chain. Several lines of evidence indicate that in Neurospora crassa the mannosyl lipid is an obligatory intermediate in the in vitro mannosylation of the protein. (a) At 15 degrees C the initial formation of the mannosyl lipid is faster than the initial formation of the mannosyl protein. (b) Exogenous partially purified mannosyl lipid can function as a mannosyl donor for the synthesis of the mannosyl protein. This reaction was also dependent on a divalent metal. The rate of this reaction was optimal at a concentration of Triton X-100 which effectively inhibited the transfer of mannose from GDP-[14C] mannose to lipid and protein, indicating that GDP-mannose was not an intermediate in the transfer of mannose from lipid to protein. The mannosyl protein formed in this reaction was indistinguishable by several criteria from the mannosyl protein formed from GDP-[14C] mannose and Mg2+. (c) The effect of a chase with an excess of unlabeled GDP-mannose on the incorporation of mannose into endogenous acceptors was immediate cessation of the synthesis and subsequent turnover of the mannosyl lipid; in contrast, however, incorporation of mannose into protein continued and was proportional to the loss of mannose from the mannosyl lipid.\n",
      "Histidine ammonia-lyase from rat liver. Purification, properties, and inhibition by substrate analogues. Histidine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.3) from rat liver was purified more than 250-fold to near homogeneity. Electrophoretic determinations indicated a native molecular weight of approximately 200,000. The enzyme has a pH optimum of approximately pH 8.5. The minimum Km for L-histidine was 0.5 mM at pH 9.0. The Michaelis constant in the physiological pH range was, however, more than 2.0 mM. D-alpha-hydrazinoimidazolylpropionic acid was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of liver histidine ammonia-lyase (Kis=75 muM); the L enantiomer of this compound was less effective in this regard. The enzyme was also inhibited competitively by L-histidine hydroxamate (Kis=0.4 mM), and to a lesser extent by L-histidinol, D-histidine, and glycine. Failure of a wide variety of other histidine analogues to inhibit the enzyme substantially indicates high specificity of the active site for L-histidine. No alternate substrates were identified for the enzyme. DL-alpha-Hydrazinophenylpropionic acid, the alpha-hydrzino analogue of phenylalanine, was similarly shown to be a very potent competitive inhibitor of a mechanistically similar L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase purified from Rhodotorula glutinis. The properties of histidine ammonia-lyase from rat liver differ significantly from those of the enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens which has been studied most extensively to date.\n",
      "Partial denaturation of mouse DNA in preparative CsCl density gradients at alkaline pH. A new technique--partial denaturation of DNA in equilibrium CsCl density gradients at pH 11.4--is used to determine the distribution of intermediate states in the melting of mouse DNA. When the technique is applied in the preparative ultracentrifuge, the DNA is fractionated according to stability. Neutralization of the partially denatured fractions results in the recovery of most of the DNA in its native form. The individual fractions are more homogeneous than the total DNA: they have decreased density heterogeneity (smaller band widths), neutral CsCl buoyant densities that differ from the average, and more homogeneous melting profiles with melting temperatures that differ from the average.\n",
      "Laser Raman spectroscopic studies of the thermal unfolding of ribonuclease A. The reversible thermal denaturation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A at pH 5 in 0.1 M NaCl over the range 32-70 degrees C as studied by Raman spectroscopy proceeds in a gradual manner consistent with a stepwise unfolding process rather than as a transition between two states. Conversion of residues from helical or pleated-sheet geometry to some intermediate geometry, as followed by means of the amide I and III lines, reveals that substantial amounts of the helical and pleated-sheet conformations remain at 70 degrees C. Changes in the strength of hydrogen bonding by the tyrosyl residues are indicated by the intensity ratio of the doublet at 830-850 cm(-1) and changes in the geometry of the disulfide bridges by the frequency and half-width of the Raman line near 510 cm(-1) due to the S-S vibration. Vibrations of C-S bonds in the methionines and cystines are used to monitor conformational changes in these residues. While there are small quantitative differences in temperature dependence among these probes, all agree in placing the malting temperature at or near 62 degrees C. The Raman data are quantitatively consistent with the six-stage scheme of unfolding of A.W. Burgess and H.A. Scheraga [(1975), J. Theor, Biol. 53, 403], except that no change in the environment of the tyrosines is seen until 45 degrees C.\n",
      "Hydrogen ion titration of horse heart ferricytochrome c. Continuous hydrogen ion titration curves of deionized solutions of horse heart ferricytochrome c have been obtained at 25 degrees C. at a constant ionic strength of 0.10 from pH 3.0 to 11.0. Titration of the oxidized protein in KCl required 28.4 equiv over that pH range, and a small hysteresis between the forward and reverse limbs was displayed. The Linderstrom-Lang approximation, which takes into account electrostatic interactions between charged groups on the protein surface, was used in a computer simulation program to analyze the forward and reverse limbs of the titration curve separately. The results indicated 1 alpha-, 12 beta- and gamma-, and 1 heme propionic carboxylic, 1 imidazole, 1 phenolic, and 18 epsilon-amino residues appear to titrate normally. Variations in the electrostatic interaction factor omega suggest conformational changes in the protein at the extremes of pH, although the relationship of the variations in omega to the magnitude of the conformational changes does not appear to be strictly quantitative for cytochrome c. These results show the acid-base behavior of cytochrome c to be complex in nature, and suggest that the Lindenstrom-Lang model may not be adequate for cytochrome c.\n",
      "Isolation of brain endopeptidases: influence of size and sequence of substrates structurally related to bradykinin. Two thiol-activated endopeptidases with pH optima near pH 7.5 were isolated from the supernatant fraction of rabbit brain homogenates by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, gel filtration and isoelectrofocusing. Peptide bond hydrolysis was measured quantitatively by ion-exchange chromatography with an amino acid analyzer. Brain kininase A hydrolyzes the Phe5-Ser6 peptide bond in bradykinin (Bk), Arg1-Pro2-Pro3-Gly4-Phe5-Ser6-Pro7-Phe8-Arg9. It is isoelectric near pH 5.2 and has a molecular weight of approximately 71 000. The enzyme also hydrolyzes the Phe-Ser peptide bond in Lys-Bk, Met-Lys-Bk, des-Arg1-Bk, Lys9-Bk, Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg, and Gly-Pro-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg, but does not hydrolyze (0.1%) this bond in des-Phe8-Arg9-Bk. Brain kininase B hydrolyzes the Pro7-Phe8 peptide bond in Bk. It is isoelectric at pH 4.9 and has a molecular weight of approximately 68 000. Brain kininase B also hydrolyzes the Pro-Phe bond in Lys-Bk, Met-Lys-Bk, Lys9-Bk, Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg, and Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg. Pretreatment of denatured kininogen with brain kininase A or B did not reduce the amount of trypsin-releasable Bk from this precursor protein, indicating that the Bk sequence, when part of a large protein, is not a substrate for either enzyme. However, kininase A and B hydrolyze the octadecapeptide Gly-Leu-Met-Lys-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Ser-Val-Gin-Val. The data show that a large part of the C-terminal portion of bradykinin is important for the brain kininase A activity and, for both enzymes, the size of the peptide and presumably the residues adjacent to the scissle bond are important in determining the rate of peptide bond hydrolysis by these endopeptidases.\n",
      "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from brewers' yeast. The effects of pH and temperature on the steady-state kinetic parameters of the two-chain protein species. A systematic study has been made of the pH- and temperature-dependency of the steady-state kinetic parameters of the stabilized two-subunit enzyme species of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, in the absence of superimposed association-dissociation reactions. The Vmax(app) data obtained in several buffers between pH 5 and 10 and at 18-32 degrees C lead to the postulate that at least two sets of protonic equilibria may govern the catalysis (one near pH 5.7 AT 25 DEGREES C and another near pH 9.2); furthermore, two pathways for product formation (i.e., two Vmax's) appear to be required to explain the biphasic nature of the log Vmax(app) vs. pH curves, with Vmax(basic) greater than Vmax(acidic + neutral). Of the several buffers explored, either a uniform degree of interaction or a minimal degree of buffer species interaction could be assessed from the enthalpy changes associated with the derived values for ionization constants attributed to the protonic equilibria in the enzyme-substrates ternary complexes for the case of Tris-acetate-EDTA buffers, at constant ionic strength. With the selection of this buffer at 0.1 (T/2) and at 25 and 32 degrees C, a self-consistent kinetic mechanism has emerged which allows for the random binding of the two fully ionized substrates to the enzyme via two major pathways, and product formation by both E-A--B- and HE-A--B-. As before (Kuby et al. Arch. Biochem, Biophys. 165, 153-178, 1974), a quasi-equilibrium is presumed, with rate-limiting steps (k + 5 and k + 5') at the interconversion of the ternary complexes. Values for the two sets of protonic equilibria defined by this mechanism (viz., pKk, pKH2 for the first ionizations, and pKk', pKH' for the second) could then be estimated. From their numerical values (e.g., at 25 degrees C: pKK = 5.7 PKH2 = 5.2; and pKK' = 9.1, PKH' = 8.2) and from the values for delta H degrees ioniz (e.g., delta H degrees pKK APPROXIMATELY 5.1 KCAL/MOL; DELTA H degrees pKK' APPROXIMATELY 11 KCAL/MOL), A POSTULATE IS PRESENTED WHICH ATTRIBUTES THESE Acid dissociation constants to an imidazole and epsilon-amino group, respectively.\n",
      "A quantitation of the factors which affect the hydrolase and transgalactosylase activities of beta-galactosidase (E. coli) on lactose. A study was implemented to quantitate the hydrolase and transgalactosylase activities of beta-galactosidase (E. coli) with lactose as the substrate and to investigate various factors which affect these activities. At low lactose concentrations the rate of galactose production was equal to the rate of glucose production. The rate of galactose production relative to glucose, however, dropped dramatically at lactose concentrations higher than 0.05 M and production of trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides began (galactose/glucose ratios of about 2:1 and 3:1, respectively, were found for these two types of oligosaccharides). At least five different trissacharides were formed and their patterns of formation showed that they probably utilized both lactose and allolactose as galactosyl acceptors. Allolactose was produced in amounts proportional to glucose at all lactose concentrations (ratios of allolactose/glucose were about 0.88). Analyses of various data, including a reaction analyzed at very early times, showed that the major means of production of allolactose (and the only means initially) was the direct enzymatic transfer of galactose from the 4 position to the 6 position of the glucose moiety of lactose without prior release of glucose from the enzyme. It was shown, however, that allolactose could also be formed in significant quantities by the transfer of galactose to the 6 position of free glucose, and also by hydrolysis of preformed trisaccharide. A mechanism which fits the initial velocity data was proposed in which the steps involving the formation of an enzyme-gallactose-glucose complex, the formation and breakage of allolactose on the enzyme, and the release of glucose all seem to be of roughly equal magnitude and rate determining. Various factors affected the amounts of transgalactosylase and hydrolase activities occurring. At high pH values (greater than 7.8) the transgalactosylase/hydrolyase activity ratio increased dramatically while it decreased at low pH values (less than 6.0). At mid pH values the ratio was essentially constant. The absence of Mg2+ caused a large decrease in the transgalactosylase/hydrolase activity ratio while the absence of all but traces of Na+ or K+ had no effect. The anomeric configuration of lactose altered the transgalactosylase/hydrolase activity ratios, alpha-Lactose resulted in a decrease of allolactose production (transgalactosylase activity) relative to hydrolase activities (glucose production) while beta-lactose had the opposite effect.\n",
      "The major sialoglycoprotein of the human erythrocyte membrane. Release with  a non-ionic detergent and purification. The major sialoglycoprotein of the human erythrocyte membrane has been selectively released by the non-ionic detergent Tween 20 and further purified in detergent-free buffers by hydroxyapatite chromatography and, finally, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on pentyl-Sepharose. The purified glycoprotein shows one main zone, PAS-1, and up to three minor zones after staining both for protein and carbohydrate in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. The relative staining intensities are concentration dependent. When the purified glycoprotein has been heated to 100 degrees C in dodecyl sulfate, more stain appears in the most rapid zone, PAS-2, and less in the slower zones, indicating a disaggregation of oligomeric forms of this glycoprotein, including a dimer, PAS-1.\n",
      "An electron paramagnetic resonance study of Mn2+ uptake by the chick chorioallantoic membrane. Mn2+ uptake in the chick chorioallantoic membrane, an embryonic epithelial tissue which transports Ca2+ in vivo was studied using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Mn2+ was used as a paramagnetic analog for Ca2+, since there is evidence that Mn2+ is accumulated by the Ca2+ transport mechanism. After 1.5 h of uptake the EPR spectrum of the Mn2+ in the membrane indicated that 89% of the Mn2+ was in a spin-exchange form, indicating close packing of Mn2+. The Mn2+ spacing was estimated from the line width to be about 4.7 A. The remaining Mn2+ was very likely Mn2+ hexahydrate. At pH 7.4 the spin-exchange spectrum tended to broaden when uptake was inhibited, while at pH 5.0 the spin-exchange spectrum was completely abolished in the presence of inhibitors. The EPR spectrum of Mn2+ in the chorioallantoic membrane had a broader line width than that of Mn2+ in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that in this tissue mitochondria are not directly involved in divalent cation transport. These EPR studies support the concept that divalent cations are sequestered in high concentrations from the rest of the cell contents during transcellular active transport.\n",
      "Spectroscopic studies on the complex formation of suramin with bovine and human serum albumin. The binding of suramin to bovine and human serum albumin was investigated by gel filtration and spectroscopic measurements. Besides some low-affinity binding sites suramin has, on the bovine serum albumin molecule one and on the human serum albumin molecule two, high-affinity binding sites. Spectroscopic measurements reveal that there are large differences between the albumins in the mechanism of binding to the high-affinity binding sites. Further, it is suggested that high concentrations of suramin provoke an unfolding of the albumin moleculse. In order to explain the unusual behaviour of suramin in connection with the displacement of other ligands from the albumin binding the fluorescence probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) was employed as a reporter group molecule for fluorescence as well as circular dichroism measurements. By these measurements it could be shown that suramin greatly influences the microorganization of both albumin molecules. In the case of these measurements large differences between bovine and human serum albumin were also found.\n",
      "Interactions between hemoglobin and organic phosphates investigated with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultrafiltration. 1. The chemical shifts (delta) of the phosphates of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were determined by phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy and were found to be displaced downfield following the addition of hemoglobin (3 mM) to a solution of either diphosphoglycerate (5 mM) or ATP (1 mM). 2. The binding of these compounds to hemoglobin was also determined by membrane ultrafiltration. A direct relationship was observed between the change in chemical shift ((delta delta) of the 2-P and 3-P of diphosphoglycerate and the percent diphosphoglycerate bound, when the latter was varied by altering pH, oxygenation state, or total diphosphoglycerate concentration. 3. In comparable studies with ATP binding, a linear relationship between the delta delta values of the gamma-, beta-, and alpha-P of ATP and the percent of ATP bound was not observed when the data from all of the experiments were plotted. NMR signals were not detectible in deoxyhemoglobin solutions containing 1 mM ATP but were seen in solutions containing 3.8 mM ATP. 4. The results indicate that 31P NMR spectroscopy is a promising tool for investigating organic phosphate interactions with hemoglobin.\n",
      "Contact-shifted resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of cytochrome b5. Resonance identification and spin density distribution in the heme group. This paper describes the identification of some of the contact-shifted resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum of low spin ferric cytochrome b5. In these experiments comparison with cytochrome b5 which had been reconstituted with deuteroheme IX played  an important role. NMR techniques used include double resonance experiments, line width analyses, and studies of the pH-dependence of the 1H NMR chemical shifts. The electronic heme structure derived from these resonance assignments is characterized by a highly anisotropic spin density distribution. This anisotropy is most strikingly manifested in the resonances of the vinyl and propionic acid substituents of the protoheme IX. The experiments described in this paper further revealed the coexistence in aqueous solutions of two different molecular species of cytochrome b5, which can be simultaneously observed in the regions of the 1H NMR spectrum which contain the largely contact-shifted resonances.\n",
      "Cooperative reactions of poly-L-lysine-heme complex with molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, or cyanide ion. The interaction of the alpha-helical poly-L-lysine-heme complex with molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, or cyanide ion was studied. Binding equilibrium curve and activation parameters for the reactions were determined. Sigmoid responses were observed for the absorption of molecular oxygen or carbon monoxide by the complex and the cooperative parameter was found to be 2.1. This indicated a cooperative interaction between hemes situated on a cylindrical alpha-helix of poly-L-lysine. But those of other polymer-ligand-heme complexes were 1.0. The cooperative reaction mechanism, in which an alpha-helical poly-L-lysine plays an important role, was suggested.\n",
      "Interaction of serum albumin with normal and sickle hemoglobins. The stability of oxyhemoglobin S during mechanical shaking was enhanced by the addition of human serum albumin. The stabilizing effect was maximum when the concentration of serum albumin approached that of oxyhemoglobin, suggesting a molecular level interaction between them. The effects of serum albumin on oxyhemoglobin A were essentially similar to those on oxyhemoglobin S. Deoxy- and methemoglobins were also stabilized by serum albumin. The addition of human serum albumin to a solution containing sickle cell oxyhemoglobin slowly formed a compound which had an absorbance peak at 620 nm. After purification by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, this compound was identified as methemalbumin. Comparison of the rates of formation of methemalbumin from hemoglobin with various ligand states and human serum albumin showed that the rate of formation from hemichrome was much faster than from met-, oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. About 60% of the heme was transferred from hemichrome to albumin when the mixture was kept standing at room temperature for 5 min, in contrast to only 5% from methemoglobin. This result suggests that hemichrome, rather than methemoglobin, is the intermediate in the formation of methemalbumin from oxyhemoglobin and human serum albumin. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the rate of formation of methemalbumin was faster at alkaline pH values than at acid pH values. Serum albumin from various animal sources showed different stabilizing effects. The formation of methemalbumin from these animal albumins was far less than that from human albumin.\n",
      "On the separation of fibrinogen degradation products D and E. Separation of fibrinogen degradation products D and E by means of gel chromatography cannot be achieved at neutral pH even in the presence of high ionic strength of the elution buffer. It is assumed that fragments D and E are linked together in a complex preventing the separation despite different molecular weights of both components. By means of addition of chaotropic substances like 1 M Kl to the elution buffer clear separation of degradation products D and E on Sephadex G-200 columns can be achieved.\n",
      "Affinity chromatography on hydroxyalkyl methacrylate gels. III. Adsorption of chymotrypsin to poly(hydroxyalkyl methacrylates) with covalently bound benzyloxycarbonyl-glycyl-D-phenylalanine and -D-leucine as function of pH and ionic strength. Chymotrypsin is specifically adsorbed at low ionic strength and alkaline pH to hydroxyalkyl methacrylate gels with N-benzyloxycarbonylglycl-D-phenylalanine or N-benzyloxycarbonylglycyl-D-leucine attached through 1,6-hexanediamine. Chymotrypsin is not adsorbed either to the unmodified gel (Spheron) or to the gel with attached, 1,6-hexanediamine (NH2-Spheron). The adsorption of chymotrypsin to Z-Gly-D-Phe-NH2-Spheron was investigated as a function of pH and ionic strength. Trypsin is not adsorbed to this gel. Chymotrypsin isolated from a crude pancreatic extract by affinity chromatography on Z-Gly-D-Phe-NH2-Spheron had the same activity as the enzyme isolated on a column of Spheron, to which the naturally-occurring trypsin inhibitor had been coupled.\n",
      "Heme-linked proton dissociation of carbon monoxide complexes of myoglobin and peroxidase. It was found from spectrophotometric titration and proton balance measurement that the pKa value of a heme-linked protonation group of horseradish ferro-peroxidase C (donor:H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7) shifted from 7.25 to 8.25 upon combination with CO. The spectrophotometric titration experiment with myoglobin also revealed the presence of a heme-linked protonation group, the pKa value being 5.57 in myoglobin and 5.67 in the CO-myoglobin complex. It was concluded that the distinct shift of the pKa value in the case of peroxidase was attributable to the presence of a hydrogen bond between the sixth ligand and the distal base. The difference in the strength of such hydrogen bonding between peroxidase and myoglobin was discussed.\n",
      "Isolation, characterization and partial sequence of cyanogen bromide fragments and thiol peptides from pig kidney D-amino-acid oxidase. A partial characterization of the primary structure of D-amino-acid oxidase (D-Amino-acid:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating), EC 1.4.3.3.) from hog kidney has been achieved by a CNBr cleavage of the 14C-carboxymethylated protein. Four fragments have been isolated and purified and their alignment made possible by overlapping with methionine-containing peptides derived from tryptic digestion of the 14C-carboxymethylated protein. A partial sequencing of the CNBr fragments has been carried out by the automated Edman procedure and by manual sequence analysis. Chymotryptic peptides containing the 5 alkylated thiols of the monomer enzyme (Curti, B., Ronchi, S., branzoli, U., Ferri, G. and Williams, Jr., C. H. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 327, 266-273) have been isolated and their sequence determined. The present results do not show any significant homologies with the known sequences of other flavoproteins.\n",
      "The fluorescence decay of tryptophan residues in native and denatured proteins. The fluorescence decay kinetics at different ranges of the emission spectrum is reported for 17 proteins. Out of eight proteins containing a single tryptophan residue per molecule, seven proteins display multiexponential decay kinetics, suggesting that variability in protein structure may exist for most proteins. Tryptophan residues whose fluorescence spectrum is red shifted may have lifetimes longer than 7 ns. Such long lifetimes have not been detected in any of the denatured proteins studied, indicating that in native proteins the tryptophans having a red-shifted spectrum are affected by the tertiary structure of the protein. The fluorescence decay kinetics of ten denatured proteins studied obey multiexponential decay functions. It is therefore concluded that the tryptophan residues in denatured proteins can be grouped in two classes. The first characterized by a relatively long lifetime of about 4 ns and the second has a short lifetime of about 1.5 ns. The emission spectrum of the group which is characterized by the longer lifetime is red shifted relative to the emission spectrum of the group characterized by the shorter lifetime. A comparison of the decay data with the quantum yield of the proteins raises the possibility that a subgroup of the tryptophan residues is fully quenched. It is noteworthy that despite this heterogeneity in  the environment of tryptophan residues in each denatured protein, almost the same decay kinetics has been obtained for all the denatured proteins studied in spite of the vastly different primary structures. It is therefore concluded that each tryptophan residue interacts in a more-or-less random manner with other groups on the polypeptide chain, and that on the average the different tryptophan residues in denatured proteins have a similar type of environment.\n",
      "Endogenous proteolytic activity and constituent polypeptide chains of sheep and pig 19 S thyroglobulin. Porcine and ovine 19-S thyroglobulins prepared from frozen glands in several buffers using slice extraction or homogenization, ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography or Sepharose 6B gel filtration were contaminated with protease activity of pH optima 4.5 and 8.6, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Optimum temperatures of autodigestion were 37 degrees C at pH 4.5 and 25 degrees C at pH 8.6. Thyroglobulins prepared from unfrozen glands pH 7.2 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate using slice extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sepharose 6B gel filtration were devoid of acid proteolytic activity but still underwent autodigestion at pH 8.6. Diisopropylfluorophosphate was a potent inhibitor of the alkaline protease activity of ovine thyroglobulin preparations. In contrast to thyroglobulin obtained from frozen glands the proteins purified from fresh unfrozen glands at pH 7.2 only showed the 19-S and the 12-S species by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. Very few bands migrating faster than 12-S were visible. After full reduction and S-alkylation of porcine and ovine thyroglobulins, no qualitative changes were observed in the gel electrophoresis pattern as compared to the unmodified proteins. Species of apparent mol. wt. corresponding to the native 12 S were the major component, strongly suggesting a mol. wt. of about 330 000 for the elementary peptide chains of pig and sheep thyroglobulins.\n",
      "The existence of three types of acetohydroxy acid synthetase in an isoleucine-requiring mutant of Aerobacter aerogenes. The synthesis of the three types of acetolactate synthase (EC 4.1.3.18) which are responsible for the biosynthesis os isoleucine and valine, was observed in Aerobacter aerogenes I-12, an isoleucine-requiring mutant, when grown on the four kinds of media. When the cells were grown on isoleucine-rich medium, acetolactate synthase sensitive to feedback inhibition and having an optimum pH at 8.0 was formed. By increasing the amount of potassium phosphate in the medium, the catabolite repression of the enzyme having an optimum pH at 6.0 and which is insensitive to feedback inhibition, was released. In contrast, acetolactate synthase having an optimum pH at 8.0 and insensitive to feedback inhibition was formd when isoleucine was limited, irrespective of phosphate concentrations. Two insensitive enzymes were not regulated by isoleucine, leucine and valine, although sensitive pH 8.0 enzyme was repressed by them. Thus, it may be assumed that the synthesis of insensitive pH 8.0 enzyme were repressed by limiting the amount of isoleucine is still open.\n",

      "Studies on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Isotope exchange at equilibrium. Investigations on the mechanism of the IMP dehydrogenase (IMP: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.14) reactions have been made at pH 7.0 by measuring rates of isotope exchange at chemical equilibrium with K+ maintained at a constant concentration. The results are generally in accord with the conclusions reached on the basis of the steady-state kinetic data obtained previously and confirm that there is random addition of IMP and NAD to the enzyme. The data also indicate clearly that at pH 7.0 catalysis is faster than the rate of IMP and/or XMP release which is rate limiting for the reaction sequence. The binding of IMP to the enzyme at pH 8.1 has been demonstrated to occur in the absence of both K+ and NAD and id independent of the K+ concentration.\n",
      "Oxidation of N-methyl substituted hypoxanthines, xanthines, purine-6,8-diones and the corresponding 6-thioxo derivatives by bovine milk xanthine oxidase. 1. The oxidation of six series of purines (hypoxanthines, xanthines, purine-6,8-diones and the corresponding 6-thioxo derivatives) by a highly purified bovine milk xanthine oxidase (EC 1.2.3.2) has been studied, using a variety of N-methyl derivatives. 2. N-Methyl substituents can either enhance or reduce enzymic rates. Enhancement is ascribed to blockade of groups which mediate unfavorable modes of binding of substrate to enzyme. Introduction of N-methyl groups can also inhibit enzymic oxidation, either by occluding essential binding groups or by preventing spontaneous or enzyme-induced tautomerisation processes, which create suitable binding sites in the substrates. 3. In all purines which are rapidly attacked by xanthine oxidase, proper attachment to the active center is mediated by the groupings (3) NH, (9) N or (3) N, (9) NH. 4. Reduced rates usually express lowered substrate affinity, which finds its expression in weak competitive inhibition of xanthine oxidation.\n",
      "Multiple forms of histone acetyltransferases in the cytosol of calf endometrium. The histone acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-) activity of calf endometrium cytosol has been separated into three separate activities by stepwise chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. In addition to differential elution from the DEAE-cellulose, the three activities are differentiated by their pH optima, preferences for histone subfractions as substrates, and stability to heat denaturation. Peak I has an optimum of pH 8.7 and preferentially acetylates histones F2b and F3; Peak II has an optimum of pH 8.5, and preferentially acetylates histone F2al followed by histone F2b; Peak III has an optimum of pH 9.5, and had similar specificity to Peak II. Peak III is appreciably more stable at 60 degrees C than is Peak II. None of the peaks transferred acetate to other proteins tested or to tRNA. These studies suggest the presence of multiple histone acetyltransferases in tissue cytosols.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of butyrylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme from Pseudomonas polycolor. A butyrylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme (EC 3.1.1.-) fo Pseudomonas polycolor IFO 3918 was purified approximately 9270-fold with a recovery of 9.9% by use of chromatographic techniques. The enzyme preparation appeared to be homogeneous when subjected to electrophoretic and ultracentrifugational analyses. The molecular weight was determined as approximately 59000 by gel filtration. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme had an isoelectric point around pH 5.1. The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of butyrylcholine with the miximum activity among various esters tested, and split benzoylcholine, propionylcholine and some aliphatic esters, but did not attact acetylcholine. The estimated value of Km at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C was 7-10(-4) M for butyrylcholine. The enzyme was irreversibly inhibited by organophosphorus compounds and carbamates, such as diisopropylphosphofluoridate and eserine. The enzyme was inhibited by some compounds, such as atropine and quinidine. Auaternary ammonium salts showed an inhibitory effect on the enzyme resembling co-operative inhibition.\n",
      "A phospholipase A2 with anticoagulant activity. I. Isolation from Vipera berus venom and properties. An anticoagulant protein has been isolated by DEAE cellulose chromatography and gel filtration from the venom of the Vipera berus orientale (Eastern Europe). Purification has been completed by elution on carboxymethyl cellulose with continuous gradient at constant pH. The inhibitor of coagulation was separated from the other venom enzymes, e.g. procoagulant, fibrinogenolytic, aminoesterase and amino acid oxidase activities. It was also separated from other phospholipase components which were not related to the anticoagulant property. The inhibitor appeared as a simgle polypeptidic chain protein, formed by 119 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 13400 and an isoelectric point of 9.2. At low saline molarity, a monomer-trimer transition of this protein was observed. Both forms had the same amino acid composition. There were six disulfide bridges without free SH groups per phospholipase molecule. Deprived of any proteolytic activity, the clotting inhibitor displayed a high phospholipase activity in the presence of calcium. Activity did no appear with EDTA buffer deprived of cation. Finely dispersed micellar suspensions were found suitable for obtaining the highest phospholipase activity. High sodium cholate concentration or methanol/chloroform/ether solvent were effective without loss of enzymatic activity. As characteristis of phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4), the degradation products identified on thin-layer chromatography induced hemolysis of human erythrocytes. The apparent Km value 1.25 - 10(-3) M was determined on phosphatidylcholine isolated from ovolecithin. This purified berus inhibitor would be of value for investigating the involvement of phospholipids in the clotting mechanism.\n",
      "A phospholipase A2 with anticoagulant activity. II. Inhibition of the phospholiped activity in coagulation. An anticoagulant factor with phospholipase A2 activity has been isolated from Vipera berus venom. Phospholipase activity was studied on platelet phospholipid and on brain cephalin. The venom factor showed a potent anticoagulant activity: 1 mug impaired the clotting of 1 ml of citrated recalcified platelet-poor plasma. The anticoagulant inhibited clotting by antagonism to phospholipid. The antagonism constant (Kan = 6.8-10(-9) M) demonstrated the high affinity of the inhibitor for phospholipid. As with other phospholipases A2, the venom factor was thermoresistant but very sensitive to photo-oxidation. Both activities (anticoagulant activity and phospholipase activity) were not markedly dissociated by either denaturation or neutralization processes. Slightly different curves of photo-oxidative inactivation of both activities suggested the presence, on the molecule, of two very close sites responsible for phospholipase and anticoagulant activities. The inhibitor effect on coagulation was independent of the hydrolysis process. In fact, lysoderivatives and fatty acids, resulting from complete hydrolysis with the venom factor, were as active as the native phospholipids. Moreover phospholipase A2 from other viperidae venom, which did not have anticoagulant activity, produced similarly active lysoderivatives. This showed that the cleavage of the beta-acyl bond does not interfere with the activity of phospholipid. A possible mechanism of clotting inhibition by the venom factor was proposed. Owing to its high affinity for phospholipid, the inhibitor would complex phospholipid at its protein binding site impairing the normal arrangement of coagulation protein factors and, consequently, their activation. The positive charges of the inhibitor (pI = 9.2) could bind with phosphoryl or carboxyl groups of phospholipid, making them unavailable for protein binding. The complex formation involves a loss of dissociating capacity of the enzyme towards its substrate. This required an additional interaction of the inhibitor with a coagulation protein factor. The inhibitor could be removed from the complex by specific antibodies, permitting recovery of normal phospholipid-protein interaction. The role of calcium in the complex has not yet been elucidated. This venom factor affords a useful tool for investigating the phospholipid-clotting protein interaction.\n",
      "Steady-state enzyme kinetics of the pancreatic ribonucleases from five mannalian species. The kinetic parameters Km, k+2 and k+2/Km of the pancreatic ribonucleases (EC 3.1.4.22) from cow, giraffe, horse, rat and lesser rorqual have been determined, using 2',3'-cyclic cytidine monophosphate and 2',3'-cuclic uridine monophosphate as substrates. No large differences were found between the activities of the five enzymes. The relative differences between the activities of the five enzymes are mainly due to differences in the rates of hydrolysis and not to differences in the affinities for the substrates.\n",
      "Alpha-D-Mannosidase. Preparation and properties of free and insolubilized enzyme. Alpha-D-Mannosidase (alpha-D-mannoside mannohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.24) has been purified to homogeneity as demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approx. 200000; the protein appears to contain 4 subunits, with molecular weights of 66000 and 44000. The enzyme was immobilized on Sepharose and the properties of the coupled and free enzyme were compared. Both were stable up to 70 degrees C with rapid loss of activity between 75-80 degrees C; both retained 25-30% activity in 6 M urea and 65% of the original activity could be restored in the coupled preparation by removal of the urea. The pH maximum of each form was approximately the same, with the maximum of the immobilized enzyme shifted slightly to a lower pH. The coupled alpha-D-mannosidase presented in this report offers the possibility of digesting high molecular weight substrates, such as glycoproteins, with the advantages of (1) recovering large quantities of digested substrate; (2) recovery of the active glycosidase; and (3) digestion at high temperatures and under conditions that denature many proteins.\n",

The protease (EC 3.4.-) was purified 565-fold with a yield of 39.5%. The 43.8 mg enzyme had a specific activity of 0.44 units/mg. According to electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal and other physical characterizations the enzyme was homogeneous. The enzyme had a MR of 57000, a S20,W-value of 4.37 S, a D20, W-value of 6.8-7.0 - 10(-7) cm2sec-1, a Stokes radius of 3.18 nm, a partial specific volume of 0.735 cm3g-1, a frictional ration of 1.25, a molecular absorbancy index at 280 nm of 5.773-10(4), an isoelectric point of 5.25 and contained 8-10% carbohydrate. The enzyme contained no cysteine. Agave protease could hydrolyze a variety of protein substrates although it did have a restricted specificity. It is not a sulphhydryl protease but seems to be an alkaline \"serine\" protease with an optimum pH of 7.8-8.0 Agave protease had marked esterolytic activity and with Cbz-Tyr-ONp had an apparent Michaelis constant of 0.0345 -10(-3) M and a V of 1.24 mol substrate/mol enzyme per sec. The enzyme did not need metal ions for optimal activity, monovalent cations did not influence its kinetic parameters, but it was inhibited by cobalt, pC1HgBzO- and TosPheCH2C1. With respect to its primary specificity, as well as its pH-dependence there was a resemblance with chymotrypsin, although the rate of hydrolysis of Agave protease is much lower.\n",
      "Yeast aminopeptidase I. Chemical composition and catalytic properties. An aminopeptidase (alpha-aminoacyl L-peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.11.1) was purified to homogeneity from autolysates of brewer's yeast. The enzyme which is responsible for most of the yeast cell's aminopeptidase activity is a glycoprotein containing about 12% of conjugated carbohydrate and 0.02% Zn2+ and having a complex quaternary structure. The active species has a molecular weight of approx. 600000 and an isoelectric point of 4.7. The enzyme is remarkably stable, even in dilute solutions. All types of L-amino acid and peptide derivatives containing a free amino terminus are attacked, including amino acid amides and esters. As to its substrate specificity, the enzyme belongs to the so called leucine-aminopeptidases. It is strongly and specifically activated by Zn2+ and Cl- (or Br-) and inactivated by metal-chelating agents. The activation by Zn2+ seems to be mediated by a conformational transition which affects exclusively V and leads to a form of the enzyme which enhanced stability against heat. Halide anions, on the other hand, are acting as positive allosteric effectors, modulating both V and Km.\n",
      "Preparation and enzymatic properties of subtilisin Novo chemically attached to soluble DEAE-dextran and insoluble DEAE-sephadex. Analogous soluble and insoluble derivatives of subtilisin Novo (EC 3.4.21.14) were prepared by coupling the enzyme to CNBr-activated DEAE-dextran and DEAE-Sephadex, respectively. The DEAE-dextran-subtilisin displayed pH optima and Km values for ester hydrolysis similar to subtilisin, whereas the pH versus activity profiles obtained with DEAE-Sephadex-subtilisin were shifter towards the alkaline pH region and the Km values were increased. Compared with subtilisin, DEAE-dextran-subtilisin showed a 40-65% reduction of kcat for hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester, p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and benzyloxycarbonyl-glycyl-L-tyrosinamide and its maximum velocities for digestion of casein and clupein also amounted to 40-60% of the subtilisin values. With Deae-sephadex-subtilisin, in contrast, the maximum velocity of hydrolysis decreased to a greater extent for polypeptide substrates compared to ester substrates. The present results indicate that the chemical nature of a support can effect intrinsic properties of a matrix-bound enzyme in addition to the steric and diffusional effects usually observed with polymer-attached enzymes.\n",
      "Photocontrol of urease-collagen membrane activity. (1) Urease (EC 3.5.1.5.) was modified with beta-1-[3,3-dimethyl-6'-nitrospiro-(indoline-2,2'-2H-benzopyrene)] propionic anhydride. Three amino acid residues of urease were modified by the anhydride at a molar ratio of 2000. (2) The activity of modified urease was decreased with ultraviolet irradiation and then restored to the initial activity with visible light irradiation. (3) Modified urease was used to prepare a urease-collagen membrane. The apparent Michaelis constant (Km) of the modified urease-collagen membrane ultraviolet light was identical to that of the membrane under visible light. (4) The optimum pH of the modified urease-collagen membrane was displaced toward lower pH values with ultraviolet irradiation. At higher ionic strength, the pH activity curve of the membrane was displaced toward higher pH values. (5) The thermostability of urease was increased with its modification.\n",
      "Fluoride inhibition of inorganic pyrophosphatase. I. Kinetic studies in a Mg2+-PPi system using a new continuous enzyme assay. Reversible inhibition of bakers' yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) by fluoride has been studied as a function of substrate, metal-ion activator and inhibitor concentrations and pH using a new continuous enzyme assay with an automatic phosphate analyzer. The inhibition was shown to be the result of tight binding of fluoride by two catalytically active enzyme-substrate complexes. The reaction between pyrophosphatase and fluoride is relatively slow, so that the rate constants for the binding and release of the inhibitor were derived from phosphate formation curves measured on the time scale of enzyme assays. The pH-dependence of the inhibition reaction in the alkaline medium indicates that both the fluoride-enzyme interaction and the catalytic step of the pyrophosphatase reaction are controlled by the same group on the protein. In the acidic medium, the inhibition is considerably enhanced, presumably because of the protonation of another enzyme group.\n",
      "Hydrolysis of neutral glycerides by lipases of rat brain microsomes. The hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol by rat brain microsomes was followed by measuring the release of glycerol and monooleylglycerol from dispersions of water insoluble glyceryl esters of oleic acid. The microsomes showed three lipolytic activities. One activity, optimal at pH 4.8, catalyzed the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol but not monoacylglycerol. Two other lipolytic activities, optimal at pH 8.0-8.6, catalyzed the hydrolysis of both diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol. The pH 8.0-8.6 activities were sensitive to heat and SH-reagents. Detergents were inhibitory in all cases. Extraction of the microsomes with KCl, KSCN, urea or Triton X-100 did not change the ratio of diacylglycerol hydrolysis at pH 4.8 and 8.0. The results of subcellular fractionation studies showed that there was no significant enrichment of the acid lipase in any fraction.\n",
      "The effect of soluble rat liver proteins on the activity of microsomal stearoyl-CoA and linoleoyl-CoA desaturase. 1. The influence of bovine serum albumin and soluble rat liver proteins on the activity of rat liver microsomal delta9 and delta6 desaturases has been studied. 2. In the absence of bovine serum albumin, the delta9 desaturase which converts stearoyl-CoA into oleoyl-CoA, shows a non-linear correlation between enzyme activity and protein concentration. 3. Optimum concentrations of bovine serum albumin have three main effects on the enzyme activity: (i) establishes a linear relationship between enzyme activity and protein concentration, (ii) stimulates the enzyme activity 2--3-fold and (iii) raises the optimum substrate concentration from 10 to 100 muM. 4. A highly purified soluble liver protein of molecular weight 24 000 also stimulated the enzyme activity and brought about a linear relationship between enzyme activity and protein concentration. 5. It was concluded that the non-linear kinetics were due to limiting amounts of substrate binding protein in the microsomal preparations. 6. The delta6 desaturase which converts linoleoyl-CoA into gamma-linolenoyl-CoA was also stimulated by bovine serum albumin and soluble liver proteins. 7. The significance of the fatty acid-binding proteins is discussed.\n",
      "Control of the formation of extracellular ribonuclease in Neurospora crassa. A finding was made that a species of ribonuclease is released into mycelial culture media when a wild-type strain of Neurospora crassa was grown on limiting amounts of phosphate. The ribonuclease activity in the fully derepressed state extends to about 60 to 100 fold of that in the repressed state. The synthesis of the ribonuclease was inhibited by the addition of rifampicin, cycloheximide or orthophosphate. Three molecular species of the ribonuclease were found. Two enzyme fractions showing larger molecular weights were suspected to be aggregates containing the enzyme showing the smallest molecular weight (molecular weight of 10 300). All three fractions showed pH optima of around 7, preferential hydrolysis of polyguanylic acid and poor hydrolysis of guanosine 2',3',-cyclic monophosphate. These characteristics were the same as those of ribonuclease N1, and it was suggested that ribonuclease N1 is a repressible extracellular enzyme. Mutations in the genes nuc-1 and nuc-2 caused loss of ability to derepress this enzyme, but heterokaryon between them partially restored the ability. The nuc-1 mutation was epistatic to the nuc-2 alleles which are partly constitutive in the ribonuclease production.\n",
      "Magnetic and spectroscopic probes for FeOFe linkages in hemin systems. Magnetic and spectroscopic properties of mu-oxo-bis-hemins from natural and structurally related porphyrins were investigated as probes for ascertaining the presence or absence of FeIII-O-FeIII linkages between hemin moieties of hemeproteins. Magnetic susceptibilities of solids from 2.2 to 293 degrees K were investigated. The data fit the temperature variations expected for a pair of antiferromagnetically coupled S = 5/2, iron (III) porphyrins with J values of 175, 190, 195, 205, and 210 degrees K for deuterohemins with hydrogen, vinyl, 2'-ethoxycarbonylcyclopropyl, acetyl, propionyl, and ethyl 2,4-substituents, respectively. This magnetic character is reflected in PMR spectra that exhibit resonances with far less broadening and paramagnetic shift than is the case for monomeric high-spin hemins. Only impurities are seen in EPR spectra, which serve effectively in monitoring the magnetic purity of preparations. An infrared active asymmetric stretching frequency characteristic of the FeOFe linkage can be identified by substitution of 160 by 180. Electronic spectra are highly characteristic with poorly resolved absorption bands. The substituents on the porphyrin ring exert significant, but usually not large, electronic and steric effects on these properties. Solvent effects were relatively small and no firm evidence for binding of ligands trans to bridging oxygen was found. The uniqueness of these physical properties and their low sensitivity to changes in porphyrin structure or medium facilitates the identification of mu-oxo linkage in hemins or oxidized hemeproteins.\n",
      "Copper (II) induced polymerization of human albumin, and its depolymerization by diglycyl-L-histidine: a pH static and ultracentrifugation study. Copper (II) ions successively induce dimers and tetramers of human serum albumin (L) when the Cu (II) concentration is extended beyond that of 200 muM. This is shown by emf titrations and by ultracentrifugation experiments. The emf titrations, which involve a new pH static method, were performed at 25 degrees, in a 0.5 M NaCIO4 medium at pH 6.59, using glass and copper amalgam electrodes. The total concentration of Cu(II) varied from 0.14 to 2.2 mM and the albumin concentration from 0.05 to 0.7 mM. In order to evaluate the formula of the main complexes, without using any a priori assumptions regarding their compositions, a detailed graphic procedure was used. The results, in the form of equilibrium constants for the main species, were refined by the use of a general least squares computer program. The experimental data are found to be consistent with the formation of the monomeric CuL, Cu5L, and Cu6L species and the dimeric Cu3L2, Cu4L, Cu6L, and Cu8L2 species. In addition, there is some indication for a minor species, most probably the Cu12L4 tetramer. The pH static results qualitatively agree with the findings obtained by ultracentrifugation. As indicated by distinct bands and their S-values, ultracentrifugation experiments show not only monomeric and dimeric species of albumin, but also tetrameric species. The polymerization of the albumin is reversible, since diglycyl-L-histidine, a peptide designed to mimic the Cu (II) transport site of albumin, depolymerizes the Cu (II)-albumin polymers.\n",
      "Studies on Copper-Acetylglycylglycine System. Reported here are studies on the copper-acetylgylcylglycine system as a function of pH and the molar ratio between the ligand and the paramagnetic ion, applying potentiometric titration, magnetic resonances (esr and nmr) and spectrophotometric techniques. The results indicate that depending on the pH of the solutions there are three distinct regions characterized by their different species and behavior. In region I (pH less than 6.5), the copper is bound to the carboxylate group of the ligand molecule (the \"blue\" complex). Precipitation of copper occurs in region II (pH-7). In region III (pH greater than 9), in the presence of excess of ligand, the copper redissolves, forming complexes in which the central copper ion binds to the peptide molecule, through the nitrogens of the deprotonated peptide groups, and to hydroxyl ions. The mutual replacement of the peptide groups of chelated AcGlyGly by OH- and the changes in the structures of the complexes are discussed.\n",
      "[Effect of pH on the separation of rat liver cells]. The effect of calcium ions, temperature and pH on the number of cells separated in the course of dispersion procedure was studied. The maximum number of separated cells corresponds to pH 6.8. Mechanical resistibility of the cells in suspension was found to grow linearly within pH interval 5.2-8.8.\n",
      "A method for the estimation of acetanilide, paracetamol and phenacetin in plasma and urine using mass fragmentography. Phenacetin, paracetamol and acetanilide can be determined in a plasma or urine sample by the use of deuterium labelled analogues. These are produced by reaction of hexadeuterioacetic anhydride with the appropriate aromatic amine. The -NHCOCD3 group is stable to hydrogen exchange below pH 8. The internal standard is added to the plasma or urine after enzymatic hydrolysis of the paracetamol conjugates and an ethyl acetate extract at pH 5 is evaporated under nitrogen and the residue derivatized with N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-acetamide. An aliquot of this solution is injected into a g.c.m.s. system, and one ion characteristic of the material under study and the ion from the deuterium analogue (3 mass units greater) are monitored using a voltage switching technique. In the case of phenacetin, for example, ions at 251 and 254 are monitored. Calibration curves relating different weight ratios of the hydrogen and deuterium compounds to their respective signals from the gas chromatography mass spectrometer are used to calculate the amount of a compound in a particular sample. These methods have been developed to study the oxidation of acetanilide to paracetamol and the de-ethylation of phenacetin to paracetamol. Preliminary results from experiments with phenacetin will be discussed.\n",
      "Studies on the chemical nature of urinary chemiluminescence. Studies on the nature of the chemicals responsible for urinary chemiluminescence have been carried out. Urinary chemiluminescence can be increased slightly by sulphatase, more by glucuronidase but most of all by boiling for 1 hour at pH 1. It is suggested that most of the chemicals responsible for urinary chemiluminescence are bound as non-chemiluminescent precursors to sulphate, glucuronic acid and in other ways. Both the chemiluminescent material and the inactive precursors are freely ultrafiltrable with molecular weights below 500. A survey of various chemicals has revealed considerable chemiluminescence in certain metabolites of naphthylamines and known to cause bladder cancer but little or no chemoluminescence in the tryptophane metabolites that have been thought to cause bladder cancer.\n",

The training of undergraduates and postgraduates in the original member countries of the European Community (Belgium, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Luxemburg, and the Netherlands) is outlined and compared with training in the U.K. and Ireland. It is noted that, in the European Community, training is inadequate and should be improved. Harmonizing with the U.K. will require concessions to be made on both sides.\n",
      "Effects of axotomy on the trans-synaptic regulation of enzyme activity in adult rat superior cervical ganglia. The effects of surgical transection of the postganglionic nerve trunk of the superior cervical ganglion on the total protein content and levels of the enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase have been studied in the adult rat. There is a minor decrease in the total activities of these 3 enzymes accompanied by a large increase in the total protein content of the ganglion. The trans-synaptic induction of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase by reserpine is not affected by postganglionic axotomy. Increased activity mediated by reserpine caused no change in the total activities of either DOPA decarboxylase or choline acetyltransferase. Previously observed effects of postganglionic axotomy on preventing transmission through the ganglion are compared with these results and the possible mechanisms by which trans-synaptic induction may occur are discussed.\n",
      "The effects of putative neurotransmitters on the resting membrane potential of dissociated brain neurones in culture. Cultures established from mechanically dissociated neonatal mouse brains were found to be suitable for electrophysiological investigation of drug action. During culture most cells were aggregated into either monolayer regions or thick cords joining monolayer regions. A few cells remained isolated. The neurones in the monolayer regions were distinguished from glial cells by differential staining, and were found to be the best subject for intracellular recording. Frequency of resting membrane potentials of these cells proved to be reproducible in cultures of the same age, and were a useful index of sensitivity to bath applied drugs. Acetylcholine, dopamine, histamine, serotonin and noradrenaline depolarized various neurones; GABA caused hyperpolarization, while glutamate and glycine had no significant effect. Antagonism of the responses to acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and GABA was seen using atropine, pimozide, methysergide and bicuculline respectively. It is concluded that dissociated brain neurones in culture show chemosensitivity and may be useful in further pharmacological studies.\n",
      "A quantitative comparison of the formation of synapses in the rat superior cervical sympathetic ganglion by its own and by foreign nerve fibres. The rat superior cervical sympathetic ganglion (SCG) has about 36,000 neurones in a volume of about 1 cu.mm. There are about 8.8 X 10(6) synapses, and 6000-9000 preganglionic axons. Section of the preganglionic chain causes a loss of 93% of the synapses. In the denervated SCG there are 0.6 X 10(6) remaining ('intrinsic') synapses, and a proportion of the synaptic sites are identifiable as vacated synaptic thickenings (3 X 10(6) per SCG, as compared with 0.5 X 10(6) in the normal intact SCG). After deducting the intrinsic synapses, this indicates that each preganglionic axon forms about 1100 (900-1400) synapses. After freezing the preganglionic chain, subsequent axonal regeneration restores synapse numbers to 85% of normal (7.5 X 10(6) synapses per SCG). After anastomotic repair by suture of the cut ends of the preganglionic chain (a necessary control for the foreign nerve anastomoses), the SCG contains only 60% of the normal complement of synapses (5.2 X 10(6) synapses per SCG). The results of this anastomosis are very variable. However, in individual ganglia the numbers of synapses are directly correlated with the numbers of axons which reach the SCG. After deducting the intrinsic synapses it can be calculated that each axon forms about 700 synapses. This is probably an underestimation of the numbers which would be achieved at longer survival times. After anastomosis of the vagal nerve into the denervated SCG there are about 4.4 X 10(6) synapses per SCG. Morphologically the majority have axon terminals with large dense cored vesicles, and it is likely that these belong to the axons of the parasympathetic preganglionic neurones in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. A smaller population of axon terminals are devoid of large dense cored vesicles; their origin is unknown. The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus has between 1000 and 2000 neurones. After deducting the intrinsic synapses, this indicates that each axon may form up to 1900-3800 synapses. To the extent that other, unidentified vagal fibres also contribute to the synapses found after this anastomosis, this figure is an overestimate. After anastomosis of the hypoglossal nerve into the denervated SCG, there are 1.5 X 10(6) synapses per SCG. A morphologically distinctive type of axon terminal is found, and it is argued that this may belong to a special category of skeletomotor neurones located in the caudoventral part of the hypoglossal nucleus and distinguished by pseudocholinesterase staining. There are about 600 of these neurones, which would indicate that they form about 1500 synapses per axon (after deducting the numbers of intrinsic synapses). The majority of the hypoglossal neurones do not form intraganglionic synapses; this suggests that although the possession of a cholinergic mechanism may be necessary for axons to be able to form ganglionic synapses, it is not in itself sufficient. For each of the types of anastomosis, the numbers of vacated thickenings are inversely proportional to the numbers of synapses...\n",
      "Properties of soluble and particulate cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase of the adult and the developing rat brain. Some properties of cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase (CSD) activity were studied in the pellet and supernatant of a 18,000 X g centrifugation of isotonic sucrose rat brain homogenates. About 50% of the enzyme activity was found associated to the particulate fraction and 16% of the activity remained particle bound after hypo-osmotic shock of the 18,000 X g pellet. The activity of the 18,000 X g supernatant showed a lower dependence on exogenous pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) than the activity in the particulate fraction. The CSD activity of these fractions also differed in optimal pH and in apparent kinetic constants. The enzyme associated to particles showed the highest Vmax and the lowest Km. The activity and kinetic characteristics of CSD were studied during brain postnatal development. In the newborn brain only a small amount of the enzyme activity was found associated to the 18,000 X g pellet. CSD in brain homogenates of immature rats was less dependent on free PLP and showed a higher Km and a lower Vmax as compared with the enzyme in the adult brain. Between birth and adulthood the enzyme activity increased more than 10-fold in the particulate fraction and 2-fold in the soluble fraction. It is concluded that the differences observed in CSD activity between newborn and adult brain are due to an increase of the particulate form of the enzyme during postnatal development.\n",

Periodic arousal in the garden dormouse is accompagnied by a rise in plasma and muscle lactate levels and a diminution of muscle glycogen.

All of which are in good agreement with the general stimulation of adrenergic activity observed at the onset of rewarming.\n",
      "Study of the natural antihistamine-like substance in bile in mammals. A natural antihistamine substance (NAS) present in bile has been investigated. It was found that the antihistamine activity was not due to proteins, lipids, pigments, or amino acids. On ion exchange chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, this activity was associated with bile acids. Many bile acids could, in varying degrees, inhibit this histamine induced guinea pig ileum contraction, desoxycholic acid being the most potent. However NAS activity could be separated from bile acids and their conjugates using a different solvent system. Furthermore, NAS showed a higher antihistamine activity than bile acids. This substance seems to be responsible for 15-20% of the activity of whole bile. The substance has not yet been identified.\n",
      "Spin labels as probes for tetraphenylboron ion interaction with liposomes. The effects of tetraphenylboron (TFB) on the molecular organization of lipids within phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes were investigated using the spin-labeled method. Perturbations at the surface of the lipid were probed using stearamide and cholestane spin labels; perturbations in the hydrophobic-portion were probed with spin-labeled amphiphilic fatty esters.\n",
      "The subcellular distribution and properties of Crithidia sp. hydrolases with particular reference to pyrophosphate and orthophosphate monoester phosphohydrolases. A cell fractionation scheme was developed for studying the distribution of certain hydrolases, especially phosphohydrolases in a Crithidia sp. (Trypanosomatidae). Whilst between 26-56% of the total cellular hydrolase activities were soluble (probably of flagellar pocket origin), a certain percentage, 5-40%, was sedimentable. A particulate fraction obtained after isopycnic density gradient centrifugation (p = 1.187-1.241), designated fraction FA/FB, was enriched in various acid hydrolases (relative specific activities 1.33-6.24) and displayed latent phosphohydrolase activities. The density gradient distributions of this hydrolytic enzymes were compared with reference to one another and malate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial marker). From the results obtained it appears that the sedimentable acid hydrolases of Crithidia are associated with a heterogeneous population of subcellular particles. Cytochemical observations on the FA/FB fraction supported this finding and revealed the association of acid phosphatase reaction product with subcellular elements resembling multivesicular bodies.\n",
      "Acid proteases from species of Mucor. IV. Hydrogen-tritium exchange of Mucor miehei protease. The kinetics of hydrogen-tritium exchange were studied in the range pH-3 for both the fully and partially tritiated protein. Exchange constants for an intermediate class and slow class of hydrogens were determined and found to give a parabolic curve characteristic of acid and base catalysis about the observed pHmin of 4.03. The anomalous rate retardation on the acid portion of the curve was attributed to electrostatic interactions which could be evaluated quantitatively from the titration data. Partial tritation and pH cross-over experiments indicated that the rank order was pH-independent thus eliminating the possiblitity of a major conformational change. Consequently, the data are most likely explicable in terms of restricted solvent accessibility.\n",
      "Some properties of acetylcholinesterase from rat retina. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) of rat retina was studied with respect to its kinetic and other properties, and a comparison was made with the enzyme from brain. The subcellular distribution of the retinal AChE showed that the enzyme was concentrated in the synaptosomal-mitochondrial fraction although in the brain the AChE was distributed more evenly between the fractions studied. The enzyme from both retina and brain was easily solubilised and exhibited a Km of the order of 10(-4) M. The pH optimum was 8.3-8.6 for the AChE from both tissues for both the soluble and particulate enzyme.\n",
      "The metabolic activation of the carcinogen 1'-hydroxysafrole in vivo and in vitro and the electrophilic reactivities of possible ultimate carcinogens. Administration of [2',3'-3H]-1'-hydroxysafrole to rats or mice resulted in the formation of hepatic DNA-, ribosomal RNA-, and protein-bound 3H derivatives. Alkaline digestion of the 3H-protein released 0.1 to 0.3% of the 3H as a derivative that was identified as 3'-methylmercaptoisosafrole by its cochromatography in five solvent systems with the synthetic compound. 1'-Hydroxysafrole was metabolized at a low rate by rat and mouse liver cytosols in a 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate-dependent reaction to a derivative (presumably the sulfuric acid ester) that was captured by its reaction with RNA. Likewise, 1'-hydroxysafrole was oxidized at a low rate by rat and mouse liver microsomes to 1'-hydroxysafrole-2',3'-oxide in a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent reaction. Both of these electrophilic metabolites are candidate ultimate carcinogenic derivatives of 1'-hydroxysafrole. The electrophilic reactivities of various safrole derivatives with nucleosides were determined to be in the order of 1'-oxosafrole greater than 1'-acetoxysafrole greater than 1'-acetoxysafrole-2',3'-oxide greater than 1'-hydroxysafrole-2',3'-oxide greater than safrole-2',3'-oxide greater than or equal to 1'-oxosafrole-2',3'-oxide. The major reactions were generally observed with guanosine. A major reaction product of 1'-acetoxysafrole and guanosine 5'-monophosphate yielded 3'-hydroxyisosafrole under very mild acidic conditions. These data further substantiate the previous characterization of this reaction product as O-6-(isosafrol-3'-yl)guanylic acid. The syntheses of 1'-oxosafrole, 2',3'-dehydrosafrole, [2',3'-3H]-1'-hydroxysafrole, and the 2',3'-oxed.\n",
      "Intrinsic resistance to methotrexate of cultured mammalian cells in relation to the inhibition kinetics of their dihydrololate reductases. Four cultured mammalian cell lines, differing in intrinsic resistance to methotrexate over a 70-fold range, have been compared with respect to several biochemical factors that might influence response to the drug. Cellular activity of the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase and the total levels of folate cofactors did not vary by more than a factor of 2 among the cell lines. All the cell types were able to transport extracellular methotrexate efficiently across the cell membrane, and at comparable rates. A kinetic study of highly purified dihydrofolate reductases from the four sources revealed small differences in the Km values for dihydrofolate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. A study was made of the inhibition of the four dihydrofolate reductases by methotrexate, and Ki values were obtained by fitting the Zone B equation of Goldstein (Goldstein, A., J. Gen. Physiol., 27: 529-580, 1944) to the resulting data. Values Ki determined by this method correlated with intrinsic resistance of the cell lines and showed a 25-fold range from the most sensitive to the most resistant line. It is concluded that the response of a cell to methotrexate is significantly influenced by the dissociation constant of its dihydrofolate reductase-methotrexate complex.\n",
      "Aflatoxin B1 metabolism to aflatoxicol and derivatives lethal to Bacillus subtilis GSY 1057 by rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) liver. Aflatoxicol, R0, was isolated from Mt. Shasta strain rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), and liver homogenates were incubated with aflatoxin B1. Its identity was confirmed by mass, infrared, and ultraviolet spectrometry. The structure was identical to one of the diastereomers prepared by chemical reduction of aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxicol was apparently formed by a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent soluble enzyme of the 105,000 x g supernatant from rainbow trout. Aflatoxicol was not lethal in phosphate buffer to Bacillus subtilis GSY 1057 (metB4, hisA1, uvr-1) nor were aflatoxins B1, Q1, and B2. In the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and trout liver microsomes, aflatoxicol reduced the viability of B. subtilis. Aflatoxin B2, which lacks the vinyl ether present in the other compounds, could not be activated. The product of aflatoxin B1 activation by trout liver microsomes was sought after incubation of 14C-labeled aflatoxin B1. The radioactivity was found in unaltered aflatoxin B1 and in three extremely polar metabolites. The quantity of the new metabolites and the level of microbial lethality was reduced by addition of cytosine and cysteine to the incubation medium. The vinyl ether configuration was a structural requirement for activation, and this finding and the nature of the enzymatic reaction were consistent with the hypothesis that the compounds were metabolized to highly reactive and unstable electrophilic products which bound to nucleophiles such as cytosine and were lethal to B. subtilis. The formation of aflatoxicol as the major product of trout liver metabolism is of great significance considering that it could be activated to a lethal compound and that rainbow trout are one of the most sensitive species to aflatoxin B1-induced carcinoma.\n",
      "Xylanase (hemicellulase) activity in cell-free rumen fluid. It has been shown that there is hemicellulase (xylanase) activity in cell-free filtrates of rumen liquor. This activity changes during the feeding cycle. The optimal pH and temperature for this activity have been found, as have the substrate-to-enzyme ratios. Many reagents, particularly heavy metal ions and phenols, inhibit the activity, but the activity is enhanced by reducing agents. No activity towards monosaccharides, disaccharides, or glycosides was found. The xylanase component was not stable, due to proteolytic enzymes in the rumen liquor, but could be purified by a variety of methods to give more-stable enzymes.\n",
      "Antitumor activity of equinatoxin. Equinatoxin, a highly basic protein extracted from Actinia equina, causes an increase in the survival time of mice bearing the ascitic form of Ehrlich carcinoma, whereas it has no effect on L1210 leukaemia. When tested for in vitro cytotoxicity by the dye exclusion test, it shows a potent activity on both tumour cell lines, with ED50 of a few ng/ml. Higher concentrations produce an extensive lysis of the cells. The cytotoxic effects of Equinatoxin are inhibited by phospholipids, thus suggesting that its mechanism of action may be related to interactions with lipids or other charged components of cell membrane. The observed lack of in vivo activity against L1210 leukaemia presumably is due to poor systemic absorption of the protein and/or neutralization by serum factors.\n",
      "[Effect of ionic strength on the protection of DNA by histone F1 against the enzymatic activity of DNase I]. Studying the effect of ionic strength on DNA protection by histone F1 against DNase I has shown a maximum protection near 0,1 M NaCl. At this ionic strength, different results have been obtained by measuring the initial velocity or the amount of DNA hydrolysed at the end of the reaction.\n",
      "[Disadvantages of acid precipitation of proteins during the assay of blood glucose by the enzymatic glucose oxidase-peroxidase system]. In the enzymatic procedure for blood sugar by means of glucose oxidase, acid protein precipitation of blood by perchloric acid or trichloracetic acid liberated oxidizing substances, which enhanced the coloration density in oxidizing the reduced chromogen of the reaction mixture, independently of the hydrogen peroxide generated from glucose, and would give false high values of glycemia, if additional precautions had not been taken. These substances, increasing considerably with times and temperature of blood conservation, would be of peroxide nature, and would accumulate in red blood cells during their exposure to air.\n",
      "Evidence for a renal alpha-adrenergic receptor inhibiting renin release. The mechanism by which clonidine suppresses renin release was investigated in conscious rats. This suppression was studied by means of selected autonomic interventions in conjunction with changes in sodium balance. Serum renin activity and direct arterial pressure were monitored. Clonidine administration suppressed basal (by 68-85%), diuretic-induced (by 89%), and sympathetic nervous system-mediated (by 75-100%) renin release. Cholinergic, ganglionic, and peripheral sympathetic neuronal blockade did not prevent this inhibitory effect of clonidine. These results indicate a peripheral site of action for suppression of renin release by clonidine. The alpha-adrenergic blocking drug phentolamine prevented clonidine suppression of renin release in sodium-depleted rats and was partially effective in normal rats. Phentolamine blocked the decrease in renin caused by clonidine in ganglion-blocked rats. Clozapine, a new neuroleptic agent with alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, or phenoxybenzamine blocked the effect of clonidine on renin release in both sodium-depleted and normal rats. After ganglionic blockade in sodium-depleted rats, clonidine caused a significantly greater suppression of renin release than did an equipressor dose of methoxamine. These data, combined with hemodynamic correlates, suggest that clonidine inhibits renin release by activation of an intrarenal alpha-adrenergic receptor.\n",
      "Effects of regional ischemia on metabolism of glucose and fatty acids. Relative rates of aerobic and anaerobic energy production during myocardial infarction and comparison with effects of anoxia. The rate of coronary flow reaching the oxygen-linited heart appears to be crucial in determining the myocardial tissue metabolic response. The tissue metabolic response to anoxia, well studied in hearts perfused with anoxic media, differs in many important ways from the response to ischemia. In regional ischemia (developing infarction) there is still a residual oxygen uptake which is reduced approximately to the same extent as the delivery of O2; there is also decreased delivery of substrates and decreased removal of CO2, H+, and lactate, with increased concentrations of these metabolites. Contents of hexose monophosphates rise rather than fall in anoxia. Measurements of glycolytic intermediates show an initial burst of accelerated glycolytic flux lasting less than 1 minute after coronary artery ligation; thereafter rates of flux decrease to control values or even less at 120 minutes. Relative inhibition of phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity may be explained by a slow rate of fall of ATP and a developing intracellular acidosis. In this model, glucose accounts for a greater part of the residual oxidative metabolism than does free fatty acid (FFA).\n",
      "Control of ionic permeabilities in normal and ischemic heart. The major ionic conductances underlying electrical activity in cardiac tissues are described. The participation of electrogenic active transport in electrical phenomenon and the influence of metabolic inhibition on cardiac action potentials are briefly summarized. Some electrophysiological effects of lactate and acidosis, such as might be induced by ischemia, are described. In dog Purkinje fibers, lactate (20 mM pH 7.0) may induce transient periods of arrhythmias. Acidosis decreases rapid sodium conductance, slow calcium-sodium conductance, and anomalous and delayed rectifications in frog atrial fibers. CO2-induced acidosis (20% CO2, pH 6.6) may alter the repolarization phase of the action potential in dog Purkinje fibers, presumably because it decreases potassium conductance. Alterations consist of partial depolarizations (humps) that result in reexcitation of the fibers and lead to a maintained depolarization. It is proposed that acidosis induces a decrease in potassium conductance that can be responsible for ectopic foci causing arrhythmias during ischemia.\n",
      "Cutaneous and muscular rasodilation in the canine hindlimb evoked by central stimulation. Using stereotaxic procedures, we electrically stimulated specific sites in the hypothalamus and midbrain of anesthetized dogs pretreated with guanethidine and atropine methonitrate. A tract in which stimulation caused noncholinergic dilator responses in the hindlimbs was identified. The course of this trace was different from that subserving cholinergic vasodilation in the hindlimb musculature. In a number of experiments we studied the proportional distribution of blood flow to leg and paw. Responses restricted to the paw were regarded as occurring mainly in cutaneous vessels; those restricted to the leg were regarded as occurring mainly in the skeletal muscle vessels. Some dilator responses in both beds were abolished by intra-arterial administration of antihistamines: other dilator responses were abolished by intra-arterial injections of dopamine antagonists. Centrally evoked dilation of leg and paw vessels by noncholinergic pathways suggests physiological roles for these fibers in the regulation of cardiovascular function.\n",
      "Spinal adrenergic mechanisms regulating sympathetic outflow to blood vessels. The role of descending spinal catecholamine (CA)-containing fibers in cardiovascular regulation was examined. Monoamine-containing fibers were visualized by fluorescence histochemical methods at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal segments. Two major groups of descending CA-containing axons were located in the lateral funiculus at the midcervical spinal level. At the thoracolumbar spinal segments CA-containing terminals were concentrated mostly around cells of the intermediolateral nucleus. In addition a distinct CA-containing fasciculus was observed at the level of the sympathetic nucleus which appeared to course toward the opposite site of the cord. To evaluate the role of the efferent CA-containing fibers, changes in heart rate, arterial pressure, femoral blood flow, and calculated peak vascular resistance were elicited by electrical stimulation of selected sites in the midcervical spinal cord. Although changes in femoral flow and arterial pressure were evoked from many midcervical sites, there was a distinct correlation between the magnitude of peak femoral resistance elevation and density of CA-containing axons activated. Furthermore, efferent spinal vasoconstrictor outflow to the hindlimbs crosses below the cervical level. This observation is in good agreement with fluorescence microscopy studies revealing CA-containing fibers which appear to decussate. Pharmacological studies also were undertaken to evaluate transmission in spinal vasopressor pathways. In these studies alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists and agonists were perfused into the spinal subarachnoid space. Heart rate, arterial pressure, femoral flow, and femoral resistance responses elicited from efferent spinal pathways were significantly attenuated following superfusion of the spinal cord with the alpha-antagonists BE-2254 (HEAT) and phentolamine. It was shown that inhibition of the centrally evoked responses was due to actions of the alpha-antagonists at a spinal locus and not due to peripheral vascular alpha-receptor blockade. Spinal perfusion with the alpha-receptor agonist norepinephrine potentiated cardiovascular responses. Likewise, loading with the norepinephrine precursor 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-dopa) enhanced vasoconstrictor responses evoked in the cross-perfused hindlimb of p-chlorophenylalanine-pretreated cats. These observations support the idea that bulbospinal CA-containing fibers relay excitatory impulses to preganglionic vasoconstrictor neurons and that spinal alpha-adrenergic receptor activation is necessary for transmission of this information.\n",
      "Cellular basis for increased sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle in spontaneously hypertensive rats. There is evidence that hypersensitivity of vascular muscle to neurotransmitters contributes to the development of hypertension. Comparison of the caudal arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their genetically related Kyoto-Wistar normotensive control rats (KNR) showed that although there is no difference in membrane potential under unstimulated conditions, greater depolarization of the SHR vascular muscle cells by norepinephrine occurs at concentrations which cause greater contraction. The mechanism for the increased depolarization and resulting increase in contraction appears to be a lower intracellular potassium ion activity in SHR vascular muscle cells, which results in a lower contribution of potassium gradient to membrane potential. Experiments to determine the sensitivity of isolated, dispersed chick omphalomesenteric vascular muscle cells to neurotransmitters showed remarkably low thresholds to the neutransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine, but not potassium chloride. The high sensitivity of isolated cells to neurotransmitters suggests that factors in the intact vessel may cause thresholds to be high, possibly implying that alterations in a neurotrophic mechanism might be responsible for changes in vascular muscle sensitivity in situ.\n",
      "Partial purification of a high molecular weight renin from hog kidney. Previous investigators have reported finding a high molecular weight (HMW) renin in various species which is activated by acidification. Two laboratories have reported that a decrease in molecular weight of the renin accompanies the acidification step. This report describes the partial purification of an HMW renin from hog kidney extracts which had previously been acidified to pH 2.5. The HMW renin, with a molecular weight of 57,000-59,000, constitutes only a small, relatively constant fraction of the total renin isolated. Omission of the acidification step or initial acidification to pH 1.6 does not change the amount of HMW renin significantly. The HMW renin attacks the protein substrate to produce angiotensin at about one-fourth the rate expected, based upon the rate at which it cleaves the tetradecapeptide substrate or a model nonapeptide substrate. It is inactivated by antiserum to hog kidney renin prepared in dogs. It is less stable than hog renin when stored at 0 degrees C. The HMW renin has a pH optimum between 6.5 and 7.0. It is not activated by acidification to pH 3, nor by tryptic or peptic digestion. We have been unable to activate HMW renin or to change its molecular weight by procedures reported by other investigators and therefore conclude that the HMW renin differs from material previously reported and may be an isoenzyme of renin.\n",
      "Vasodilator administration in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade. To explore the possibility that the presence of propranolol-induced beta-adrenergic blockade might have an adverse effect upon homeostatic circulatory reflexes activated by the administration of a potent vasodilator agent, arterial blood pressure and pulse rate response to rapid intravenous diazoxide injection was monitored before and after pretreatment with propranolol in ten hypertensive patients. It appeared that beta-adrenergic blockade had no clinically significant effect on the magnitude of hypotension or the degree of heart rate acceleration induced by the administration of the potent vasodilator diazoxide. This reflex vasodilator-induced cardio-acceleration after propranolol adminstration could be the result of incomplete blockade of endogenously released neurotransmitter, inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system, or a direct pharmacologic action of diazoxide. Diazoxide administration to hypertensive patients in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade was not associated with any clinically significant hemodynamic consequences.\n",
      "A modified inactivation-inhibition method for determining the serum activity of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes. A procedure using heat inactivation and L-phenylalanine inhibition to quantitate the activities of bone, liver and intestinal alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes in human serum was confirmed by alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme analysis using an electrophoretic procedure. The results of this assay were compared with the radionuclear 85Sr test, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in a group of patients with hepatobiliary and bone diseases.\n",
      "A sensitive automated colorimetric method for the determination of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. A highly sensitive and accurate automated method using a Technicon Autoanalyzer AAII was developed for the determination of human serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. gamma-L-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide added as substrate was split to p-nitroaniline and the gamma-glutamyl group was trapped by glycylglycine in Ammediol/HC1 buffer solution. Liberated p-nitroaniline was diazotized and converted by Tsuda Reagent (N,N-(diethyl)-N'-(1-naphthyl) ethylendiamine) to an azo-dye possessing an absorbance maximum at 550 nm. This new method of determination, using the conversion of p-nitroaniline to azo-dye, was found to be 7 times more sensitive as compared to the conventional direct p-nitroaniline determination method [1]. This method requires only 0.1 ml lerum and permits 60 determinations per hour.\n",
      "Suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in guinea-pigs with poly-L-lysine. Poly-L-lysin (PLL) given subcutaneously in a dose of 3 mg/day suppresses experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in guinea-pigs. The suppressive effect of PLL can still be demonstrated when administration is begun 8 days post-immunization. The effect is disease- and species-specific since PLL (3 mg/day) does not suppress experimental allergic orchitis in guinea-pigs, nor does it suppress EAE in rats (1-5 mg/day). PLL (0-2 mg/day) does not decrease the severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVH) in mice as judged by the spleen/body weight assay.\n",
      "Reactions to cigarettes as a function of nicotine and \"tar\". Experiments carried out to examine the effects of nicotine and \"tar\" on the extent of and subjective reactions to cigarette smoking. It was confirmed that smokers rate commercial, low-nicotine cigarettes as less \"strong\" and less \"satisfying\" than their usual brands. Since such cigarettes deliver reduced amounts of tar as well as of nicotine, an experiment to distinguish between the two was carried out with special cigarettes. Ratings of \"strength\" were directly related to nicotine but were not affected by tar. The numbers of cigarettes smoked fell slightly as their estimated delivery of nicotine increased, but tar had no effect on this index. The urinary excretion of nicotine was correlated with the rated yields of nicotine for the different cigarettes, but there was also evidence that subjects tended to adjust their manner of smoking so as to titrate their doses of nicotine. The results are interpreted as indicating a role for nicotine, but not for tar, in the maintenance of cigarette smoking behavior, and as support for the view that less harmful cigarettes should have a high yield of nicotine relative to tar.\n",
      "Effect of beta-adrenergic agonists aerosolized by freon propellant on tracheal mucous velocity and cardiac output. The present study was designed to assess the effects of two beta-adrenergic agonists, isoproterenol sulfate and carbuterol hydrochloride, and aerosolized Freon propellant (a mixture of Freon II, Freon 12, and Freon 114) on tracheal mucous velocity and cardiac output in anesthetized dogs. Five groups of ten animals each received the following dosages of aerosols: Freon, 20 puffs; isoproterenol, four puffs; carbuterol, four puffs; isoproterenol, 20 puffs; and carbuterol, 20 puffs. The puff was delivered by a standard metered aerosol; each puff of isoproterenol spray contained 75 mug of isoproterenol sulfate, and each puff of carbuterol spray contained 100 mug of carbuterol hydrochloride. Tracheal mucous velocity was not changed by receiving Freon, but administration of both isoproterenol and carbuterol caused a significant increase in this measurement, with peak increases ranging from 74 to 111 percent above control values. The duration of action for four and 20 puffs of isoproterenol and for four puffs of carbuterol was two hours. Twenty puffs of carbuterol increased tracheal mucous velocity for three hours. Administration of carbuterol effected a slightly larger increase in cardiac output than isoproterenol. The duration of action for the increased cardiac output was shorter than the duration of action for the increased tracheal mucous velocity. These studies indicate that beta-adrenergic agonists may have an important role in improving mucous transport in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in whom mucociliary clearance is depressed.\n",
      "Effect of nafenopin (SU-13437) on liver function. Influence on the hepatic transport of phenolphthalein glucuronide and chlorothiazide. In rats treated with the hypolipidemic drug, nafenopin (NP), for 2 days the biliary excretion of phenolphthalein glucuronide (PPG) was markedly decreased, while in contrast that of chlorothiazide (CTZ) was enhanced. This suggests the existence of independent hepatic transport mechanisms for these two anions. For both PPG and CTZ blood disappearance curves showed an initial, rapid phase followed by a second, slow phase. The rapid phase for both compounds is affected only slightly by pretreatment with NP. Therefore, it is inferred that suppression of biliary excretion was attributable mainly to impairment of the liver-to-bile transport process. The increased bile flow induced by NP treatment was previously shown to be related to the biliary excretion of NP and its metabolites. Inhibition of NP choleresis by PPG may involve competition for biliary transport of these compounds. The marked hepatomegaly and choleresis seen after NP pretreatment was more evident in male rats than in females.\n",
      "Distribution and biliary excretion products of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate in rainbow trout. After 24-hr exposures of rainbow trout to 0.5 ppm of di-2-ethylhexyl [14C]phthalate, one-half of the radioactivity present in the fish was localized in the bile. The bile was pooled and fractionated by selective solvent extraction before and after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis. Individual radioactive compounds were further separated and characterized by thin-layer chromatography. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to confirm the results of thin-layer chromatographic analysis. These procedures demonstrated that bile contained a number of DEHP metabolites, but only about 1% of unchanged DEHP. The major metabolite, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate glucuronide accounted for 72% of the total bile radioactivity. The remaining bile radioactivity was found to be present as phthalic acid glucuronide, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and two partially characterized polar metabolites.\n",
      "Binding of radioactivity from (14C)thiourea to rat lung protein. Binding of radioactivity from [14C]thiourea (TU) to rat lung protein was found to occur in vitro. Two binding sites are present. One possesses low affinity/high capacity while the other is characterized by high affinity/low capacity. In vitro binding of [14C]TU to lung protein can be antagonized by the presence of either unlabeled congeners (alpha-napthylthiourea or phenylthiourea) or thiol-containing compounds (cysteine, reduced glutathione). Conversely, depletion of lung-reduced glutathione by means of diethyl maleate administration results in elevated protein binding. Prior administration (24 hr) of a sublethal dose of TU (which renders tolerance to a subsequent lethal dose in vivo) results in a decrease in in vitro binding of radioactivity from [14C)TU to lung protein. In addition, immature rats, which are less sensitive to the edematogenic effect of TU, bind less radioactivity from [14C]TU to lung protein when the drug is administered in vivo. These results suggest a correlation between [14C]TU binding to lung protein and the pathophysiological effect of the drug in the lung.\n",
      "Uptake and disposition of chlorinated biphenyls by isolated perfused rat liver. The hepatic disposition of four chlorinated biphenyls was studied in isolated perfused rat liver preparations perfused with 30% rat blood. Biliary excretion of 14C-labeled 4-chlorobiphenyl (1-CB): 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl (2-CB): 2,4,5,2',5'-pentachlorobiphenyl (5-CB) and 2,4,5,2',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (6-CB) appeared to be inversely related to increased chlorination. Each of the compounds was rapidly taken up by the liver from the circulating perfusate. After 4 hr of perfusion, biliary excretion of 14C from 1-CB, 2-CB, 5-CB, and 6-CB was 48.2, 29.6, 20.5, and 1.3% of total dose, respectively. For 1-CB, this rate of biliary elimination represents a maximum perfusate/bile ratio of 107. About 97% of the label in the bile from 1-CB experiments was in the form of metabolites. Biliary excretion of 1-CB was biphasic: an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 = 13 min) was followed by a slower second phase (t 1/2 = 122 min). When the metabolites of 1-CB were added to the perfusate, biliary excretion of these metabolites was monophasic; t 1/2 = 120 min, which corresponded to the slower phase observed when the parent compound was presented to the liver. 1-CB disappeared from the perfusate via a biphasic process. Metabolites of 1-CB effused into the perfusate immediately after the initial rapid uptake of 1-CB by the liver, and the recirculating pool of metabolites was eliminated in the bile by the slow postsynthetic phase of biliary elimination. Less than 2% of 1-CB was present as the parent compound in the perfusion system after 4 hr of perfusion. These findings indicate that the metabolism of 1-CB is not the limiting factor in the hepatic disposition of 1-CB and that the circulating metabolites of 1-CB effusing from the liver might be the major source for urinary excretion.\n",
      "(14C)Methylphenidate hydrochloride. Studies on disposition in rat brain. Studies with [14C]methylphenidate-HCl were carried out in rats administered the drug intravenously or intraperitoneally. Levels of total radioactivity and parent drug were measured in plasma, brain, and certain brain regions up to 6 hr after dosing. The intravenous route of administration was characterized by rapid entry into brain; during the first half hour, brain levels were 3- to 6-fold higher than those obtained by the intraperitoneal route. At later time periods, brain and plasma concentration for both routes were comparable, and the decline of drug concentrations in brain paralleled that in plasma. No significant variance was found in regional distribution of drug in brain. Whereas the major fraction of circulating drug consisted of metabolites, predominantly unchanged drug was found in brain. After intravenous injection of [14C]ritalinic acid (the major metabolite of methylphenidate), no substantial concentrations were found in brain.\n",
      "The absorption, distribution, and excretion in mice of a quinolinemethanol antimalarial, 2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4-(1-hydroxy-3-(N-t-butylamino)propyl)quinoline phosphate (WR 184,806). Approximately 75% of the radioactivity derived from WR 184806-14C was excreted in the feces with the remainder in the urine after po administration. At least 77-85% of the dose was absorbed by 2-8 hr; lungs, liver, skeletal muscle, kidneys, small intestine (less contents) and residual carcass were major sites of deposition of total radioactivity. Within these tissues the radioactivity present was predominantly as WR 184,806 rather than its metabolites. Peak blood plasma levels of WR 184,806 occurred at 2-4 and 7-10 hr. The peak erythrocyte level of WR 184,806 occurred at 6 hr. The presence in the urine and feces of unchanged WR 184,806 was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and inverse isotope dilution.\n",
      "Oxisuran metabolism in pigs. The fate of oxisuran in the pig was studied with 14C-labeled drug to quantify its biotransformation and disposition. Despite interanimal differences, it was clear that the compound absorbed rapidly and biotransformed extensively to metabolites which were excreted principally in urine rather than in feces. Direct attacks upon oxisuran involved reduction to diastereo-isomeric oxisuran alcohol sulfoxides and oxidation to oxisuran sulfone. Subsequently, the oxisuran alcohol sulfoxides were reduced to a sulfide and oxidized to a sulfone. Phase II reactions appeared to be limited to sulfation of oxisuran alcohol sulfoxides and oxisuran alcohol sulfone. Pharmacokinetics were investigated for oxisuran and its metabolites.\n",
      "Qualitative metabolic fate of phenoxybenzamine in rat, dog, and man. Use of 15N-labeling. Administration of an equimolar mixture of unlabeled and 15N-labeled phenoxybenzamine to rats and dogs facilitated identification of urinary metabolites by gas chromatography/chemical-ionization mass spectrometry by virtue of the the conspicuous equal-intensity ion pairs produced. By use of this technique N-benzyl-N-phenoxyisopropylamine (III), N-benzyl-N-(p-hydroxy-phenoxyisopropyl)amine (IV), and 2-benzylamino-1-propanol (VI) were identified as metabolites in rats. Phenoxyisopropylamine (V) as well as III and IV were identified in dogs. Compound IV was identified in humans under clinical treatment with phenoxybenzamine. The metabolites were screened for cardiovascular activity in rats. Compound III had weak alpha-adrenergic blocking activity and V elicited a hypertensive response.\n",
      "Metabolism of trans-stilbene in rabbits and rats. The biotransformation of intramuscularly administered 14C-labeled trans-stilbene was investigated in both rabbits and rats. In rabbits radioactivity was excreted (78.8% in 17 days) almost exclusively in the urine. In rats, feces accounted for more than half of the total excretion (80.3% in 19 days). Hydroxylated metabolites in urine and feces were identified by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. They were 4-hydroxy and 4,4'-dihydroxystilbene, and the two monomethyl ethers of 3,4-dihydroxystilbene and 4,4'-dihydroxybibenzyl. In addition, four polyhydroxylated metabolites of stilbene and bibenzyl were identified in rat urine by comparison of gas-liquid chromatography retention times of their silyl derivatives with synthetic reference compounds. They were 3,4,4'-trihydroxystilbene, and 3,4-dihydroxy-, 3,4,4'=trihydroxy-, and 3,4,3',4'-tetrahydroxybibenzyl. Oxidative cleavage of trans-stilbene to benzoic acid and 4-hydroxy- and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was established by the presence of both the free acids and conjugates of these compounds in both rabbit and rat urine. Their glycine conjugates were identified by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by reverse isotope dilution procedures from unhydrolyzed rabbit and rat urine. Percentages obtained indicate that cleavage of trans-stilbene is more extensive in rabbits (9.5%) than in rats (2.7%).\n",
      "Differential dependence on NADPH concentrations of two microsomal corticosteroid 21-hydroxylation reactions. The dependency on NADPH concentrations of the bovine adrenal cortex microsomal 21-hydroxylation of progesterone and of 17-hydroxyprogesterone was investigated. The average Km for NADPH in the 21-hydroxylation of progesterone is 10.4 muM while that for the 21-hydroxylation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone is 0.6 muM. The optimal NADPH concentrations for these two hydroxylations are, in average, one order of magnitude apart. The different affinities of the two 21-hydroxylating activities with respect to NADPH may indicate the presence of independent 21-hydroxylation reactions for these two steroid substrates. This evidence is consistent with the observed genetic data in human congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n",
      "Identification of the urinary metabolites of 14C-bumetanide in the rat and their excretion by rats and dogs. Unchanged bumetanide, 3-(n-butylamino)-4-phenoxy-5-sulfamoylbenzoic acid, and five metabolites were excreted in the urine of rats given 50 mg of 14C-labeled drug per kg intravenously. The metabolites, which were identified by mass spectrometry and/or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, arose by metabolic alteration of the n-butyl sidechain. In metabolites I-V, the butylamino group was converted to -NHCH2CH2CH2COOH, -NHCH2CH2CH2CH2OH,, -NHCH2CH2CHOHCH3, -NHCH2CH2CHOHCH2OH and -NH2, respectively. The total urinary and fecal excretion of labeled drug and metabolites after iv and oral administration of 14C-bumetanide was estimated in dogs given 0.5 mg/kg and in rats given 5 mg/kg. In the dog, the primary excretion product was unchanged drug, although evidence was obtained that the acyl glucuronide of bumetanide was secreted in dog bile. The major metabolite excreted by the rat was I, and negligible quantities of intact drug were excreted in the urine after oral or iv administration. Optical activity was found for the two metabolites that contained a chiral center (III and IV), indicating that they were formed by a stereoselective hydroxylation.\n",
      "Studies of the metabolism of parathion with an apparently homogeneous preparation of rabbit liver cytochrome P-450. The metabolism of parathion has been examined by use of a reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system isolated from the livers of phenobarbital-pretreated rabbits. The cytochrome P-450 used in these studies was apparently homogeneous as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by assay of the preparation for contaminating microsomal enzymes and enzyme activity. These studies revealed that the apparently homogeneous preparation of cytochrome P-450, in the presence of the appropriate cofactors, can catalyze the conversions of parathion to both paraoxon and diethyl phosphorothioic acid. The present studies have also shown that parathion is metabolized by the reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system to diethyl phosphoric acid, a product which, in previous studies with intact liver microsomes, had been thought to arise exclusively from the hydrolysis of paraoxon by a microsomal esterase(s). The available data suggest that all three of the products of the metabolism of parathion by the reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system, namely, paraoxon, diethyl phosphorothioic acid, and diethyl phosphoric acid, are formed nonenzymatically by breakdown by different pathways of a common enzymatically formed intermediate. This common intermediate is thought to be the sulfine derivative of parathion formed in the mixed-function oxidase-catalyzed addition of an oxygen atom to one of the unshared electron pairs of the thiono-sulfur atom.\n",
      "Reconstituted liver microsomal enzyme system that hydroxylates drugs, other foreign compounds, and endogenous substrates. IX. The formation of a 455-nm metabolite-cytochrome P-450 complex. The reconstituted liver microsomal hydroxylation system was used to study the formation of a metabolite-cytochrome P-450 complex absorbing maximally at 455 nm, with benzphetamine and N-hydroxyamphetamine as substrates. Complex formation required the presence of NADPH, substrate, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, lipid, and cytochrome P-450, indicating that metabolism of the substrate is essential. In the presence of fixed amounts of lipid and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, the rate of complex formation with cytochrome P-450 isolated from phenobarbital-treated rats was much greater than that observed with cytochrome P-48 from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats or rabbits. These results are consistent with recent studies indicating that different forms of cytochrome P-450 with distinct spectral, catalytic, and immunological properties exist in liver microsomes.\n",
      "The response of Ca-mediated action potentials and contractile activity in mammalian ventricular myocardium towards alkalosis. Alkalosis (pH 7.8) produced by reduction of CO2 concentration augmented both upstroke velocity of Ca action potentials and isometric contractile force of mammalian heart muscle. If the increase of pH to 7.8 was achieved by a raise of HCO3 concentration (with simultaneous reduction of CO2 concentration), the positive inotropic response was not accompanied by an augmented Ca current. Obviously, the well-known positive inotropic effect of alkalosis does not only depend upon the enhancement of transmembrane Ca influx during excitation, but can be mediated alone by affecting intracellular Ca movements as well.\n",

      "Some chemical aspects of histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Certain chemical properties, which may determine the biological actions of the recently discovered histamine H2-receptor antagonists burimamide and metiamide, are identified, partly by considering the derivation of these antagonists. Examples are given of attempts to design antagonists using histamine as starting point. A partial agonist was eventually obtained through modifying the side chain of histamine but retaining the imidazole ring. Further developments led to the synthesis of uncharged thioureido analogues and to the discovery of the antagonist, burimamide. Consideration of the relative concentration of imidazole tautomers led to the replacement of a methylene group (-CH2-) with an isosteric thioether (-S-) link in the side chain, and incorporation of a methyl group in the imidazole ring; these changes afforded metiamide, an orally active antagonist. These developments emphasize that the imidazole ring appears to have a special importance at H2 receptors. Burimamide and metiamide are hydrophilic molecules that resemble histamine in having an imidazole ring but differ in the side chain which, though polar, is uncharged. By contrast, the H1-receptor antihistaminic drugs are lipophilic molecules; their resemblance to histamine is in having a positively charged ammonium side chain. These substantial chemical differences between the respective antagonists probably determine their selectivity in distinguishing between the two types of histamine receptor. Furthermore, the very low lipophilicities of these H2-receptor antagonists probably account for the lack of central nervous system and local anesthetic effects normally associated with the use of antihistaminic drugs.\n",
      "The pharmacology of burimamide and metiamide, two histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Burimamide and metiamide are two histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Evidence is presented that indicates the competitive nature and the specificity of the antagonism. Metiamide is about ten times more potent than burimamide and is also more effective than burimamide when given orally. Both compounds inhibit gastric secretion and the evidence is consistent with this inhibition being due to competitive antagonism of H2 receptors in the gastric mucosa. Burimamide, unlike metiamide, causes release of catecholamines even at dose levels that are just sufficient to produce H2-receptor antagonism. Burimamide, but not metiamide, has alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity. In certain models for inflammation, particularly rat paw edema induced by compound 48/80, burimamide in combination with the H1-receptor antagonist mepyramine shows anti-inflammatory activity. This may, in part, be associated with the catecholamine-releasing properties of the compound. Metiamide is less active in this respect.\n",
      "Identification and blockade of vascular H2 receptors. Experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs to determine the nature of receptors mediating vascular actions of histamine. In the perfused gracilis muscle histamine caused vasodilatation that was attenuated in part by mepyramine, an H1-receptor blocker. Metiamide, an H2 blocker, given alone had no effect on dilatation. However, the combination of mepyramine and metiamide resulted in a large attenuation of dilatation. Histamine caused constriction of the perfused saphenous vein that was totally blocked by mepyramine suggesting that venoconstriction by histamine involves only H1 receptors. Histamine infusion caused a fall in arterial pressure and a large reduction in peripheral resistance. Mepyramine attenuated the fall in pressure but not the reduction in resistance. Combined H1- and H2-receptor blockade largely eliminated the effects of histamine infusion further documenting the existence of H1 and H2 receptors. The effects of H1 and H2 antihistamines on a variety of physiological vasodilator responses were examined. Evidence was obtained to indicate that H1- and H2-histamine receptors are involved in the active component of baroreceptor-mediated reflex vasodilatation, poststimulation vasodilatation, sympathetic vasodilatation in the guanethidine-treated dog, and vasodilator responses following compound 48/80. No evidence for the participation of either H1- or H2-histamine receptors in reactive hyperemia or the dilatation accompanying exercise was found. It is concluded that in the dog both endogenously-released and exogenous histamine exert vascular effects by activation of both H1 and H2 receptors.\n",
      "Cardiac histamine receptors. Current evidence pertinent to the identification of cardiac histamine receptors in the guinea pig is reviewed. Pharmacological characterization has been aided by the use of selective agonists and antagonists for both types of histamine receptors. It appears that both H1 and H2 receptors mediate the cardiac effects of histamine. Histamine H2 receptors mediate the positive chronotropic and ventricular inotropic effects. H1 receptors mediate the negative dromotropic effect of histamine and possibly the atrial inotropic effect. Histamine-induced arrhythmias involve H1 receptors (arrhythmias of conduction) or H2 receptors (arrhythmias of automaticity), or both. The receptors mediating the histamine-induced increase in coronary flow are not as clearly defined: both H1 and H2 receptors might be implicated.\n",
      "Lack of relationship between cyclic nucleotide levels and spermatozoal function in human semen. Cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels were determined in 103 samples of human semen and grouped according to the number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. No correlation was found between cyclic AMP concentrations and the number, motility, and morphology of the spermatozoa or the fructose content, pH, and volume of the ejaculate. Similar findings were obtained with cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels in 24 samples of human semen. Therefore, cyclic nucleotide levels in human semen appear to be derived from sources other than spermatozoal adenylyl or guanylyl cyclase.\n",
      "Quality, efficiency, and cost of a physician-assistant-protocol system for managment of diabetes and hypertension. Briefly trained physicians assistants using protocols (clinical algorithms) for diabetes, hypertension, and related chronic arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease abstrated information from the medical record and obtained history and physical examination data on every patient-visit to a city hospital chronic disease clinic over a 18-month period. The  care rendered by the protocol system was compared with care rendered by a \"traditional\" system in the same clinic in  which physicians delegated few clinical tasks. Increased thoroughness in collecting clinical data in the protocol system led to an increase in the recognition of new pathology. Outcome criteria reflected equivalent quality of care in both groups. Efficiency time-motion studies demonstrated a 20 per cent saving in physician time with the protocol system. Coct estimates, based on the time spent with patients by various providers and on the laboratory-test-ordering patterns, demonstrated equivalent costs of the two systems, given optimal staffing patterns. Laboratory tests were a major element of the cost of patient care,and the clinical yield per unit cost of different tests varied widely.\n",
      "Suppression and stimulation mechanisms controlling glucagon secretion in a case of islet-cell tumor producing glucagon, insulin, and gastrin. The mechanisms controlling secretion of glucagon and other pancreatic hormones were studied in a patient affected with multihormone-secreting islet-cell tumor. Fasting glucagon levels (3,000 pg./ml.) rose to 10 ng./ml. following arginine stimulation. While oral glucose load and intravenous glucose infusion did not suppress glucagon secretion, insulin administration induced a prompt depression in glucagon levels. Glucagon, insulin, and gastrin levels were suppressed by somatostatin while calcium infusion caused a paradoxical increase. It is suggested that only some of the stimulation-inhibition mechanisms were conserved in this case of glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor.\n",
      "Histamine effects on H+ permeability by isolated gastric mucosa. This study examines the effects of histamine on mucosal permeability to acid by isolated stomach of rabbits. Histamine (9 X 10(-5) M) decreased antral luminal acid loss which could not be accounted for by active H+ secretion or appearance of organic acid. Histamine also increased antral electrical resistance and decreased the unidirectional luminal to serosal flux (Jls) of (14)c-erythritol. Histamine, theophylline, and N(6),O(2)-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate did not significantly alter secretion by fundus in the presence of salicylate (5 X 10(-3)M). However, after removal of salicylate, these agents stimulated acid secretion. Histamine decreased luminal acid loss by both antrum and fundus treated with salicylate, increased the electrical resistance of these tissues, and decreased Jls erythritol of fundic mucosa. Burimamide (1 X 10(-3) M) inhibited the permeability effects of histamine on antrum and fundus. The data indicate that histamine decreases spontaneous antral mucosal permeability as well as salicylate-induced increase in mucosal permeability of both antrum and fundus. The effects of burimamide suggest that antrum contains H2 receptor sites urelated to acid secretion and that fundus contains H2 receptor sites which also govern permeability but are independent of those related to acid secretion.\n",
      "Genetics of murine liver and kidney arysulfatase b. Mice from 12 inbred strains were surveyed for variation of kidney and liver arylsulfatase levels. Kidney variation was due to differences in the activity of arylsulfatase B. Twofold higher activities of arylsulfatase B in SWR/J kidney compared to A/HeJ kidney were determined by an autosomal gene which may be identical to the structural gene for arylsulfatase B since the SWR/J enzyme was more heat-stable than the A/HeJ enzyme. C57BL/6J mice possessed two-fold higher liver arylsulfatase levels than did A/HeJ mice. The major portion of this variation could be attributed to differences in arylsulfatase B, and appeared to be inherited in autosomal fashion. Although some evidence supports the existence of a major locus influencing liver arylsulfatase activity, this must be substantiated by further studies. Whatever the nature of the genetic factors involved, they do not appear to involve structural genes since no differences were discernible between the enzymes of the two strains relevant to Km, heat stability, electrophoretic mobility, pH optimum, activation energy, or response to several inhibitors. Furthermore, the rank ordering of strains on the basis of kidney arylsulfatase activity differed markedly from that which pertained to liver activity. Kidney arylsulfatase levels, but not brain or liver arylsulfatase activities, appear subject to androgenic influences.\n",

The higher inhibitory activity of milk with the BB type beta-lactoglobulin was found which retained in dilution 1 : 32. The total flora of teat, cyst and parenchyma milk of animals with the BB type beta-lactoglobulin as well as Enterococcus bacteria were much lower than in milk of cows with the AA type homogenous form. The animals with the first type of milk protein had mastitis more rarely as compared to those with the second type.

Adult mice of C57BL/6, CBA (CBA X C57BL/6) F1, (CBA X C57BL/6) F2, F1 X CBA and F1 X C57BL/6 strains were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with a constant dose of 3-10(5) C57BL/6 bone marrow cells. At the 9th day after the bone marrow transplantation the colony count was performed in spleen of irradiated recipients. In the spleen of F1, CBA and C57BL/6 mice were registered low (0--8, intermediate (6--18) and high (22-40) numbers of colonies respectively. The segregation ratios in F2 progeny were close to 2 (low): 1(intermediate): 1(high). The segregation ratios in backcross (F1 X CBA) were close to 1(low): 1(intermediate)numbers of colonies. Backcrosses (F1 X C57BL/6) were distributed to low and high numbers of colonies with the ratio 1:1. The number of spleen colonies of males and females was the same in all segregating progeny. The results of hybrid analysis suggest that a single pair of allelic genes is involved in genetic control of allogenic inhibition, and that the resistance (manifestation of inhibition) to C57BL/6 stem cells is conferred by the dominant allele.\n",
      "Inhibition of food-stimulated gastric acid secretion by cimetidine. The effect of cimetidine, a new histamine H2-receptor antagonist, on gastric acid secretion stimulated by a homogenised meal was studied in six normal volunteers using an in vivo intragastric titration technique. The subjects were studied twice, no more than 48 h apart, receiving either cimetidine 200 mg or placebo in random order. Cimetidine administered either 32 men before (three subjects) or with the meal (three subjects) significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion in all the subjects throughout the period of study; 96 min after food, total acid secretion decreased by 67 and 57% respectively. When the drug was taken with the meal absorption was slower (mean peak blood level 2-34 mumol/l, 80-128 min after dosing) than when administered on an empty stomach (mean peak blood level 5-08 mumol/l, 48-64 min after dosing). Blood cimetidine concentration correlated significantly (P less than 0-01) with percentage inhibition of acid output and the calculated concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of gastric acid secretion (IC50) was 1-6 mumol/l. Secretion of gastrin in response to food was unaffected by cimetidine. The results suggest that 200 mg cimetidine effectively inhibits food-stimulated acid secretion and that the bioavailability of the drug may be affected by the timing of dosage in relation to meals. No unwanted effect were observed.\n",

      "Adherence of bacterial to vaginal epithelial cells. Vaginal epithelial cells from healthy women were washed and incubated in tissue culture medium with freshly isolated bacteria of the indigenous vaginal flora and with bacteria of species that have been discussed in conjunction with genital infections. After incubation and washing, the number of bacteria that adhered per cell was determined. The influence on the attachment rate of such factors as variations in the washing procedure, bacterial density, and incubation time was assessed. Lactobacillus acidophilus and other bacterial species that occur in the lower genital tract of healthy women, e.g., some strictly anaerobic species, adhered by significantly lower numbers per cell than Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group B streptococci, and Corynebacterium vaginale. Significantly more freshly isolated gonococci adhered per cell than gonococci that had been passaged on artificial medium.

      "Biological properties of an immunogenic pneumococcal subcellular preparation. A subcellular fraction, designated PSP-3R, prepared from rough, type 3R Streptococcus pneumoniae is described, which affords excellent protection to mice against challenge with smooth organisms of the homologous serotype 3S and significant protection against heterologous challenge with serotypes 1S and 2S. Adjuvant enhances the protective capacity of the vaccine but is not necessary for immunogenicity. Protection induced by PSP-3R can be passively transferred tp normal mice with serum from actively immunized animals. The protective capacity can be completely absorbed out with rough or smooth type 3 organisms but not with rough type 1R or 2R cells. PSP-3R immune serum was tested in a passive hemagglutination assay against type 3 capsular polysaccharide-coated erythrocytes and found to have no detectable anticapsular antibody.

      "Nonspecific bactericidal activity of the lactoperoxidases-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system of milk against Escherichia coli and some gram-negative pathogens. Two strains of Escherichia coli and one strain each of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed by the bactericidal activity of the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system in milk and in a synthetic medium. H2O2 was supplied exogenously by glucose oxidase, and glucose was produced at a level which was itself noninhibitory. Two phases were distinguished: the first phase was dependent on the oxidation of SCN(-) by lactoperoxidase and H2O2, which was reversed by reducing agent, and the second phase was dependent on the presence of accumulated H2O2, which was reversed by catalase. The latter enzyme could also reverse the first phase, but only when present in excessive and unphysiological levels. The bactericidal activity was greatest at pH 5 and below, and it depended on the SCN(-)concentration and on the number of organisms. Since raw or heated milk neutralizes the acid barrier against infection in the stomach, the bactericidal system discussed may contribute to the prevention of enteric infections in neonates.\n",

      "Partial purification and properties of Enterobacter cloacae heat-stable enterotoxin. Cell free preparations of the whole-cell lysate and ultrafiltration (UF) fractions of broth cultures of a strain of Enterobacter cloacae, isolated from a Puerto Rican with tropical sprue, were assayed for their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum. The whole-cell lysate and UM-10 retentate of broth cultures were inactive. The UM-2 retentate and filtrate were active at a concentration of 100 mug/ml or more; the toxigenic activity was entirely retained, and increased to 1 mug/ml, by a UM-05 membrane; washing this retentate yielded a fraction with an activity of 10 ng/ml. Stationary aerobic culture conditions yielded the most active UF fractions when ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitating agent, whereas anaerobic culture conditions produced the most active fractions in broth cultures precipitated by acetone. Passage of the active acetone-precipitated UF fractions through a Sephadex G-25 column yielded eluate pools with enhanced toxigenic activity in, or adjacent to, the void volume, but maximum activity of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated UM-05 retentate eluated at a Kav of 0.38 to 0.52. Neither of the most active gel filtration elution fractions of the UM-05 retentates contained detectable carbohydrate, suggesting that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin. Toxigenic activity was unaltered by exposure to a temperature of 100C for 30 min, lowering the pH to 1, or incubation with either Pronase or trypsin. These observations indicate that the strain of E. cloacae under study elaborates a heat-stable enterotoxin htat has approximately the same molecular weight and shares many of the characteristics of the heat-stable enterotoxin produced by some strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n",

      "Interaction of cholera toxin and toxin derivatives with lymphocytes. II. Modulating effects of cholera toxin on in vivo humoral and cellular immune responses. The in vivo effects of cholera toxin on lymphoid organ structure and function in mice were investigated. It was found that within a day following intravenous injection of 1 mug of toxin, thymus as well as spleen weight decreased but the animals remained healthy. Histological studies suggested that the involution of lymphoid organs was due to cell death. Injection of cholera toxin into adrenalectomized mice was lethal within 36 h. In these animals no decrease in lymphoid organ weight was noted. Thymus cells from toxin-treated mice were found to be much inferior to thymocytes of untreated animals in their in vitro response to Concanavalin A, whereas the response of spleen cells from toxin-treated animals to mitogens was slightly increased. 1 mug of cholera toxin increased primary antibody formation when given to mice together with antigen (sheep erythrocytes) and decreased primary antibody formation when given before or after the antigen. The toxin also increased secondary antibody formation when injected simultaneously with or after the booster antigen dose, and decreased the antibody formation when given a few days before the booster injection. Treatment of mice with toxin was found to increase the capacity of spleen cells from these animals to induce the parental effect on antibody formation and to induce graft-versus-host reactions. The mechanisms behind the observed effects are discussed. It is suggested that cholera toxin affects different types of cells involved in immune responses primarily by a direct inhibitory action on cellular proliferation but also indirectly by causing release of adrenal gland hormones.\n",
      "Electron paramagnetic resonance studies on spin-labelling of pepsin: effects of temperature, pH and urea on its conformation. Pepsin was spin-labelled with N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) bromoacetamide, possibly at the active site, at a beta-catboxyl group of a reactive aspartic acid. The spectrum of the spin-labelled pepsin showed that the spin probe was strongly immobilized (correlation time is greater than or equal to 10(-8) sec). Spin-labelled pepsin was thermally denatured at various temperatures and electron paramagnetic resonance (e.p.r.) spectra were taken at various times. Rates of denaturation estimated from the e.p.r. spectra at various temperatures showed that the enthalpy and entropy of thermal denaturation of spin-labelled pepsin at pH 3.5 were 48.0+/-4.9 kcal/mole and 214.7+/-14.5 e.u. respectively. Addition of conc. NaOH or 1 M acetate buffer at pH 6.0 sharpened e.p.r. spectra of the spin-labelled pepsin, indicating that the spin probe became mobilized by alkaline denaturation. Addition of urea caused unfolding of the protein which increased with the urea concentration, although only slight transition of conformational changes was observed in the e.p.r. spectra.\n",
      "Characterization of an alkaline subtilopeptidase type Pfizer. The physiochemical properties, amino acid composition and profile of the the tryptic peptides for an alkaline subtilopeptidase type Pfizer have been determined. The enzyme is stable in the pH range from 5 to 10, has a pH optimum of 9.5 to 10, and is relatively stable for a period of 2 h up to a temperature of 50C. Homogeneity was demonstrated by electrophoretic techniques and the mobilities indicated on isoelectric point of 8.7. The molecular weight was found to be 25,000 by gel filtration. The amino acid composition was found to be Ala32, Arg4, Aspgamma8, Glu15, Gly29, His4, Ile9, Leu13, Lys11, Met5, Phe4, Pro14, Ser31, Thr17, Tyr9, Val22, a total of 247 amino acid residues. The enzyme does not contain either disulfide bonds or cysteine, and lacks tryptophan as well. The N-terminal end-group residue is alanine: the C-terminal amino acid is arginine. Tryptic hydrolysis of the enzyme produced 15 peptides which were separated by gradient elution on Dowex 50-X2. The amino acid composition of each appropriately purified tryptic peptide was established.\n",

      "Psychophysiology of pain. The recent literature on pain states shows: pain thresholds are relatively constant for an individual, but pain tolerance is influenced by psychological state; the expression of pain is a function partly of ethnic membership and degree of extroversion; pain complaints are determined as well by cultural and extroversive factors, and also degree of neuroticism. Studies of pain patients reveals that those with acute pain tend to show normal personality profiles, but the degree of pain experienced is related to the degree of anxiety present. Most chronic pain patients, like those with psychogenic pain, show somatic preoccupations and reactive depression. The treatment and/or rehabilitation of pain patients has developed in three areas. In cases of peripheral neuropathy and some spinal cord lesions, electrical stimulation with \"neural pacemakers\" can often \"close the gate\" to pain signals and provide significant reduction or abolition of pain. Psychotropic medications, particularly the tricyclic antidepressants, sometimes in combination with phenothiazines and antihistamines, are effective in many instances of central pain, and help increase the pain tolerance and decrease the need for narcotics in other pain states. Operant conditioning, including the use of biofeedback, extinguishes pain behavior and increases pain-incompatible behaviors, with good long-term results.\n",

The mosquito cells were more sensitive than suckling mice and marginally better than Vero cells for primary isolation. This is the first time that mosquito cells have been successfully used for primary isolation of YF virus from field material.\n",
      "The effect of sorbose on pH of mixed saliva and interproximal plaque. Stimulated mixed saliva and interproximal plaque were exposed to the ketohexose sorbose. The average pH of an in vitro 1%-sorbose/saliva mixture increased with time when compared with a highly significant pH-decrease of a sucrose/saliva mixture. In contrast to sucrose rinses, the telemetrically recorded pH of interproximal plaque did not drop below pH 5.5 during and subsequent to rinsing with sorbose solutions.\n",
      "Comparison of antibiotic-amended potato dextrose agar and acidified potato dextrose agar as growth substrates for fungi. Fifteen fungal species, all isolated from food, were compared for their growth abilities on potato dextrose agar acidified to pH 3.5, and on nonacidified potato dextrose agar amended with 40 ppm chlortetracycline hydrochloride. Comparisons were made at 16, 21, 26, 32, and 37 degrees C. Of the 15 species, only Penicillium expansum exhibited better growth on the acidified medium than on the nonacidified antibiotic medium, while 9 species grew better on the nonacidified antibiotic medium. Five species grew equally well on either medium.\n",
      "Luminescence and respiratory activities of Photobacterium phosphoreum. Competition for cellular reducing power. Changes in the in vivo luminescence, respiratory activities, contents of cytochromes, extractable luciferase and NAD(P)H-FMN reductase during growth of the wild (bright) strain of Photobacterium phosphoreum and its dim mutant were determined. The intensity of the in vivo luminescence per cell increased 10 times in the wild strain and 750 times in the dim strain during logarithmic growth, while the contents of luciferase and NAD(P)H-FMN reductase remained almost constant. It is suggested that a characteristic change in the mode of competition of the luminescence reaction system with another electron transfer chain involving cytochromes for NAD(P)H take place during the growth of this bacterium.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of inorganic pyrophosphatase from Bacillus stearothermophilus. Inorganic pyrophosphatase [EC 3.6.1.1] was purified from Bacillus stearothermophilus to a homogeneous state both ultracentrifugally and electrophoretically. Ultracentrifugal analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the enzyme is 122,000 and the sedimentation coefficient (S0.34%/20, W) is 5.2S. The enzyme molecule in 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate solution containing 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol had an estimated molecular weight of 70,000 on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results, which indicates that the enzyme may consist of two subunits. Divalent cations such as Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ are required for the enzymatic activity. Pyrophosphate is the only substrate for the enzyme. ATP and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibit the enzyme reaction markedly.\n",
      "Studies on peroxisomes. V. Effect of ethyl p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate on the centrifugal behavior of rat liver peroxisomes. After Wistar male rats had been fed on a diet containing 0.25% of ethyl p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB) for 28 days, changes in the enzyme activities and centrifugal behavior of rat liver peroxisomes were investigated. (1) Compared with control rats fed on the basal diet, the catalase [EC 1.11.1.6] activity of rat livers after the administration of CPIB increased about 2.5-fold, while urate oxidase [EC 1.7.3.3] activity did not change significantly. Though D-amino acid oxidase [EC 1.4.3.3] activity markedly decreased to approximately one-sixth of the control, the activity of L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase [EC 1.1.3.15], a flavin enzyme like D-amino acid oxidase, was not affected significnatly after the administration of CPIB. (2) When the hepatic cells of CPIB-treated rats were fractionated by differential centrifugation, most of the increase of catalase activity appeared in the supernatant fraction. A decrease in the hepatic D-amino acid oxidase activity of CPIB-treated rats was observed in all the fractions. As for the subcellular distribution of the particle-bound enzymes, the specific activities of both catalase and urate oxidase of CPIB-treated rat livers were higher in the light mitochondrial fraction than in other fractions. (3) Sedimentation patterns in a sucrose density gradient did not show any difference between normal peroxisomers, and CPIB-treated ones. (4) In the case of CPIB-treated rats, studies of their sedimentation patterns by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation showed two main particulate peaks containing both catalase and urate oxidase, although only a single peak was observed in the case of control rats.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of pyruvate decarboxylase from sweet potato roots. Pyruvate decarboxylase [2-oxo acid carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.1] was isolated from sweet potato roots and was partially purified from healthy and diseased tissues. There was no appreciable difference in properties between the enzymes from healthy and diseased tissues. The molecular weight of the enzyme was found to be 240,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a molecular weight of 60,000 for the monomeric form of the enzyme, it is likely that sweet potato pyruvate decarboxylase contains 4 single polypeptide chains. The optimal pH of the decarboxylation reaction was 6.1--6.6. The Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot curved upward, and the Hill coefficient was more than 1, with low concentrations of pyruvate. The enzyme was localized in the cytosol fraction. The activity of the enzyme increased in response to black-rot fungus infection, but decreased in response to cutting.\n",
      "Quantitative determination of anomeric forms of sugar produced by amylases. V. Anomeric forms of maltose produced in the hydrolytic reaction of substituted phenyl alpha-maltosides catalyzed by saccharifying alpha-amylase from B. subtilis. 1. Hydrolyses of phenyl alpha-maltoside and its derivatives with various substituents (p-NO2, p-C1, p-CH3, p-C2H5, and p-C(CH3)3) catalyzed by saccharifying alpha-amylase from B. subtilis3 [EC 3.2.1.1] were studied under conditions such that the products were only maltose and the corresponding phenols (1), in order to determine quantitatively the anomeric form of the sugar produced from each substrate. 2. At the optimum pH of this enzyme (pH-5.4), maltose released from all the substituted substrates studied was entirely in the beta-form. These results are in remarkable contrast to the previous finding that alpha-maltose is exclusively produced from unsubstituted phenyl alpha-maltoside by this enzyme (2). 3. At pH 6.18 and 6.73, maltose produced from unsubstituted phenyl alpha-maltoside (øM) or p-tert-butylphenyl alpha-maltoside (PTBøM) was a mixture of alpha- and beta-anomers, the ratio being dependent on pH as follows: For øM, the percentage of alpha-anomer was 100% (pH 5.4), 80 (pH 6.18), and 55% (pH 6.73), whereas for PTBøM, the percentage of beta-anomer was 100% (pH 5.4), 75% (pH 6.18), and 60% (pH 6.73).\n",
      "Studies on a phospholipase B from Penicillium notatum. Purification, properties, and mode of action. 1. Phospholipase B which hydrolyzes both the acyl ester bonds of diacylphospholipids (diacyl-hydrolase) and the acyl ester bond of monoacylphospholipids or lysophospholipids, [monoacyl-hydrolase or lysophospholipase, EC 3.1.1.5] was purified from Penicillium notatum about 2000-fold over the crude extract. The final preparation was homogeneous on disc electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight, determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, was about 116,000. The isoelectric point was pH 4.0. 2. The purified enzyme was a glycoprotein. The carbohydrate content was approximately 30%, consisting of mannose, glucose, and glucosamine. The amino acid composition was also determined. 3. The ratio of monoacyl-hydrolase to diacyl-hydrolase activities was influenced by the physical state of the substrate in the assay system. It was about 1 : 1 or 100 : 1 in the presence of absence of Triton X-100, respectively, and the latter value remained constant throughout the purification procedures. 4. Both enzyme activities had the same pH optimum, 4.0, and were heat-labile. None of the metals tested had any effect on either activity except for Fe2+ and Fe3+. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate at relatively high concentrations completely inhibited both enzyme activities. 5. The Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) of the enzyme for egg lecithin were about 1.5 and 25 mM in the absence and presence of Triton X-100, respectively. The Km value for dicaproyllecithin was 9.8 mM in the absence of Triton X-100. 6. Using a mixture of 1-[14C]stearoyl-lecithin and 2-[14C]oleoyl-lecithin in the presence of Triton X-100 as a substrate, it was found that the P. notatum phospholipase B attacked the acyl ester bonds sequentially, first the 2-acyl and then 1-acyl groups.\n",
      "Substrate specificity of carboxypeptidase from Watermelon. The substrate specificity of carboxypeptidase (F-II) purified from watermelon for various synthetic peptides and esters was examined kinetically. The enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity against various carbobenzoxy- and benzyl-dipeptides. Peptides containing glycine or proline were hydrolyzed slowly by the enzyme. Peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids were hydrolyzed rapidly. The presence of hydrophobic amino acid residues, not only at the C-terminal position but also at the second position and probably the third position from the C-terminal resulted in an increase in the rate of hydrolysis. Inhibition studies with diisopropyl flurophosphate and diastereomers of carbobenzoxy-Phe-Ala demonstrated that the peptidase and esterase activities of the enzyme are both catalyzed by the same site of the enzyme molecule, but the binding sites for peptides and esters seem not to be the same. The enzyme also had amidase activity, which was optimal at pH 7.0.\n",
      "Further confirmation of carboxypeptidase Y as a metal-free enzyme having a reactive serine residue. The metal content of carboxypeptidase Y was analyzed by the atomic absorption method. After exhaustive dialysis against an EDTA solution, the enzyme showed no loss of activity nor any significant content of metals (Zh,Mg,Ca,Cu,Mn,Ni,Fe, and Co). The activity was, however, rather sensitive to preincubation with various metals. The reactivity of a serine residue of the enzyme was also reevaluated. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) stoichiometrically and irreversively inhibited the enzyme. The rate of inactivation with DFP was much faster than that for typsin [EC 3.4.21.4] and chymotrypsin [EC 3.4.21.1.], while the rate with PMSF was one-fifteenth of that for chymotrypsin. The pH-dependence of the inactivation by DFP was similar to that of the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylphenylalanine ethyl ester. The present results indicate that carboxypeptidase Y is free of metals and has a serine residue with a vital role in the catalytic process, though the functional role of this SH group remains to be clarified.\n",
      "Inhibition of polypeptide synthesis by tRNA fractions in rat liver cell-free systems. The mechanism of inhibition of polypeptide synthesis by the addition of a tRNA fraction in a rat liver cell-free system was studied. The inhibition was found to occur at the step of aminoacyl-tRNA binding to ribosomes, in which aminoacyl-tRNA's were mainly responsible for the inhibition. The addition of EF-1 decreased the inhibition by the tRNA fraction. The tRNA fraction inhibited polypeptide synthesis in a polysome-S100 system under conditions in which poly U- and poly A-dependent polypeptide syntheses were not inhibited. The possibility that the aminoacyl-tRNA inhibitory activity functions through improper binding to the ribosomes in the polysome-S100 system is discussed.\n",
      "alpha-Chymotryptic hydrolysis of derivatives of the specific substrates with substituents in the nucleus. Steady state kinetic studies of alpha-chymotrypsin [EC 3.4.21.1]-catalyzed hydrolysis of nucleus-substituted derivatives of the specific substrates were made at pH 6.5 and 7.8. Ac-Trp(NCps)-OMe was hydrolyzed more readily than Ac-Trp-OMe owing to its smaller Km value. The kcat values of Ac-Trp(CHO)-OMe and Ac-Tyr(3-no2)-ome were higher than those of the corresponding unmodified substrates, suggesting that derivatives with a substituent as large as a formyl or nitro group at the epsilon-position are stereochemically favorable to the catalytic process. Derivatives of Ac-Phe-OMe with a chain of four atoms at the 3 or 4-position of the phenyl nucleus and 2,3-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indoles derived from Ac-Trp-OMe were not hydrolyzed at all.\n",
      "Intracellular pH (pHi) of red cells stored in acid citrate dextrose medium. Effects of temperature and citrate anions. The intracellular pH (pHi) of red cells stored in acid citrate dextrose (ACD) medium was estimated by the 5,5'-dimethyloxazoldine,-2,4-dione (DMO) method. The initial pHi at 4degrees was about 7.6 and was higher than the extracellular pH (pHe) at 4degrees. During storage, both pHi and pHe decreased, but the former was always higher than the latter and the former decreased more slowly than the latter. The high pHi of ACD blood was a results of the temperature at which the pHe and the pHi were measured (4degrees) and the presence of citrate anions in the medium, and could be explained by application of the Donnan-Gibbs equilibrium. ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) were well-maintained in heparinized blood when it was acidified and pHe and pHi at 4degrees were both about 7.4, which suggests that improvement of blood preservation may be attained by suitable adjustment of the pHi and pHe of the blood.\n",
      "Purification and properties of two ribonucleases in different intracellular compartments in pea root tissue. Two RNases in bound forms associated with the microsomal membrane and with the ribosomes or unknown particles in pea root tissue were solubilized by subjecting the membrane to sonic oscillation in the presence of EDTA and KC1 and by treating the particles with EDTA, respectively. The RNases were than purified by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-75 column chromatographies. The elution profiles of RNases from the columns were very similar. No significant differences were observed in their electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels, in molecular weight, in activation by inorganic ions, urea or phospholipid micelles or in the dependence of their activities upon pH. The purified RNASES were not different from the bound enzymes as regards activation by inorganic ions and urea and the dependence of the activity upon pH. Triton X-100 stimulated the activity only if RNase was in a bound form associated with the microsomal membrane. We propose that the two RNases may be the same molecular species and differ only in the form of association with intracellular structures.\n",
      "Purification and properties of an exo-cellulase component of novel type from Trichoderma miride. An enzyme extract from Cellulase-Onozuka, a commercial product of Trichoderma viride, was fractionated by Amberlite CG-50 column chromatography into three cellulase [EC 3.2.1.4] groups, peaks I to III. A noval enzyme, which has both beta-glucosidase [EC 3.2.1.21] and exo-carboxymethyl-cellulase (exo-CMCase) properties was obtained from peak III by extensive purification throuh consecutive column chromatography. The enzyme was homogeneous on ultracentrifugation, SDS-gel and cellulose acetate film electrophoreses and molecular sieve chromatography on Bio-Gel P-150. The molecular weight of this enzyme was estimated to be 53,000. The enzyme appeared to release cellobiose residues one by one from the nonreducing end of higher cellooligosaccharides and CM-cellulose (CMC), but to release glucosyl residues from reduced cellotriose and beta-cellobioside, resembling a beta-glucosidase in this respect. Furthermore, this exo-CMCase also attacked xylan exo-wise to produce xylobiose moleculaes one by one, but it scarcely attacked insoluble cellulose, except for a cellodextrin apparently rich in amorphous structure.\n",
      "Studies on D-tetrose metabolism. VI. Crystallization and some properties of D-erythrulose reducatase from beef liver. D-Erythrulose reductase of beef liver was crystallized from ammonium sulfate solution at pH 8.17. The crystals are needle-shaped. The enzyme protein contains 851 amino acid residues per mole of the enzyme: Lys28, His11, Arg52, Asp79, Thr58, Ser56, Glu68, Pro20, Gly80, Ala107, Val112, Met24, Ile31, Leu88, Tyr7, Phe22, Trp4, and Cys4. The enzyme is inactivated by exposure to temperatures below 12degrees. The inactivation is accelerated by increasing the salt concentration and decreasing the enzyme concentration. The pH of the medium also has a pronounced effect, the maximum stability of the enzyme is obtained at pH 8.5. NADP+ protected the enzyme from cold inactivation at all stages of the process and also afforded protection against inactivation by heat and pH. The cold inactivation of the enzyme is accompanied by dissociation of the enzyme protein to subunits.\n",
      "Studies on phospholipases from Streptomyces. III. Purification and properties of Streptomyces hachijoensis phospholipase C. 1. Phospholipase C [EC 3.1.4.3] found in the growth medium of Streptomyces hachijoensis was purified about sixty-fold by dialysis and column chromatography on Sephadex G-50. 2. The active fraction was separated by isoelectric focusing into two fractions, phospholipase C-I (pI 6.0) and phospholipase C-II (pI 5.6). 3. Both purified phospholipases C were homogeneous by immunodiffusion and were not differentiated as regards antigencity. 4. Phospholipase C-I had maximal activity at pH 8.0 and the optimal temperature was 50degree. Phospholipase C-I was stable at 50degrees for 30 min and was stable at neutral pH. 5. The activity of phospholipase C-I was inhibited by high concentrations of various detergents such as Triton X-100, sodium, cholate, SDS and was also inhibited by Ca2+, Ba2+, Al3+, and EDTA, but was stimulated by Mg2+, and ethyl ether. 6. The Km value of phospholipase C-I was 0.9 mM, using phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. 7. By the gel filtration procedure, the molecular weights of phospholipase C-I and -II were both determined to be 18,000. 8. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, cardiolipin, sphingomyelin, and lysophosphatidylcholine were hydrolyzed by phospholipase C-I, but phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine were hydrolyzed with difficulty under the same conditions, Phospholipase C-I also hydrolyzed phosphatidic acid.\n",
      "Thermal denaturation and regeneration of japanese-radish peroxidase. Thermal denaturation of Japanese-radish peroxidase [EC 1.11.1.7] was investigated with respect to its spectrophotometric properties and effect on the enzymatic activity. Inactivation of the peroxidase occurred at temperatures higher than 60degrees and involved three processes, i.e., dissociation of protohemin from the holoperoxidase, a conformation change in the apperoxidase, and the modification or degradation of protohemin. The splitting process of protohemin from holoperoxidase as followed by the change in the absorption spectrum at high temperatures coincided with the degrease in the activity, and it was found to be at least biphasic. The regeneration of peroxidase on cooling to room temperature was essentially reversible at neutral pH, while at pH 5 and pH 9 these processes were irreversible. The irreversibility at acidic pH was mainly due to an irreversible change in the conformation of the apoenzyme. The difference spectrum of heat-treated apoperoxidase exhibited a denaturation blueshift with negative maxima at 287 and 294 nm, and the total protein fluorescence quantum yield. qprotein, increased by 20% compared to that of the untreated apoenzyme. On the other hand, the irreversibility at alkaline pH was largely attributable to the modification of protohemin. Apoperoxidase was more resistnat to heat denaturation but the modification or degradation of protohemin in heated enzyme was greater at alkaline pH than at acidic pH. The pyridine-ferrohemochrome spectrum of peroxidase exhibited slight shifts of the maxima of the alpha-band to shorter wavelength on heat treatment, and the paper chromatogram showed the presence of a new derivative other than protohemin. The modified product is probably (2(4)-vinyl-4(2)-hydroxyethyldeuterohemin.\n",
      "pH dependence of the binding constants of N-acetylglucosamine monomers to hen and turkey egg-white lysozymes. The binding constants of N-acetylglucosamine (G1cNAc) and its methyl alpha- and beta- glycosides to hen and turkey egg-white lysozymes [EC 3.2.1.17], in the latter of which Asp 101 is replaced by Gly, were determined at various pH values by measuring changes in the circular dichroic (DC) band at 295 nm. The binding of beta-methyl-G1cNAc to turkey and hen lysozymes perturbed the pK value of Glu 35 from 6.0 to 6.5, the pK value of Asp 52 from 3.5 to 3.9, and the pK value of Asp 66 from 1.3 to 0.7. In addition, perturbation of the pK value of Asp 101 from 4.4 to 4.0 was observed in the binding of this saccharide to hen lysozyme. The binding of alpha-methyl-GlcNAc to hen and turkey lysozymes perturbed the pK value of Glu 35 to the alkaline side by about 0.5 pH unit, the pK value of Asp 66 to the acidic side by about 0.5 pH unit, and the pK value (4.4) of an ionizable group to the acidic side by about 0.6 pH unit. The last ionizable group was tentatively assigned to Asp 48. The pK value of Asp 52 was not perturbed by the binding of this saccharide. The pH dependence curves for the binding of GlcNAc to hen and turkey lysozymes were very similar and it was suggested that Asp 48, in addition to Asp 66, Asp 52, and Glu 35, is perturbed by the binding of GlcNAc.\n",
      "Elementary processes in the interaction of serine protease with a possible transition state analog. Subtillisin-benzeneboronic acid system. The interaction of benzeneboronic acid(BBA), a possible transition state analog, with subtilisin BPN' [EC 3.4.21.14] was studied by the temperature-jump method at various pH's, temperatures and in D2O as well as H2O. From analysis of the concentration dependence of the relaxation times, it was suggested that the subtillsin-BBA interactions consist of at least two elementary steps, a fast bimolecular association followed by a slow unimolecular process. Similar concentration dependence was observed at pH 6.1-6.7 at 25degrees. However, in D2O the reciprocal relaxation times generally decreased compared to those in H2O and became concentration-independent below pD 6.5. The relaxation times were influenced considerably by the temperature. From these results, the slow unimolecular process was assigned to the trigonal-tetrahedral interconversion of BBA at the active site of the enzyme.\n",
      "Kinetic studies of carboxypeptidase Y. III. Action on ester, amide, and anilide substrates and the effects of some environmental factors. Kinetic parameters of carboxypeptidase Y are given for the hydrolyses of ester, amide, and anilide substrates. The kcat/Km values were compatible with those of chymotrypsin [EC 3.4.21.1] with a few exceptions. One ionizable group with a pK of around 5.8 was suggested to be involved in the free enzyme in hydrolyzing all the substrates, including peptide substrates. In addition, hydroxylaminolysis and the kinetic isotope effects of deuterium oxide indicated, with some reservations, a reaction mechanism which proceeds via the formation of an acyl intermediate.\n",
      "Developmental changes in the structure and kinetic properties of myosin adenosinetriphosphatase of rabbit skeletal fast muscle. Structural and functional changes in myosin of fast muscles during early post-natal development were studied to seek correlations with well-known physiological changes in the contraction rate. The findings were as follows: 1. It is known that fetal fast muscle myosin contains three kinds of light chains. It was confirmed that their molecular weights were the same as those of adult fast muscle myosin, but different from those of adult slow muscle myosin. The amount of the smallest light chain, g3, was confirmed to increase markedly during the postnatal period. 2. The ATPase [EC3.6.1.3] activity of fetal fast muscle myosin (-1 day) was found to be about 50% of that of adult myosin. The pH-activity curve of fetal myosin ATPase was confirmed to be similar to that of adult myosin. 3. The rate of formation of the reactive myosin-phosphate-ADP complex, MADPP, was found not to change during post-natal development. 4. It was found that the rate of decomposition of MADPP in the presence of F-actin increased markedly during the post-natal period, and that the rate of decomposition of the complex of fetal mysoin was only 1/6 to 1/4 of that of adult myosin. The change in the actomyosin ATPase activity was found to be closely correlated with the increase in the g3 content during development.\n",
      "Control of rabbit liver fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase activity by magnesium ions. EDTA at a concentration of 1 muM produced a threshold effect in the activation of purified rabbit liver fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase [EC 3.1.3.11] in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+ at pH 7.2. Without EDTA, biphasic activation curves were produced by Mg2+. A double-reciprocal plot of the data gave the Km values corresponding to the two linear regions. They were 0.19 and 0.83 mM at pH 7.5, and 0.055 and 0.83 mM at pH 9.1. In the presence of 5muM EDTA a sigmoidal curve was obtained for Mg2+ activation in the range of noninhibitory Mg2+ concentrations at pH 7.2. The apparent Km value for Mg2+ was 0.15 mM, and the Hill coefficient was 2.0. At pH 9.1 cooperativity among the Mg2+ sites disappeared, and the apparent Km value for Mg2+ was 0.055 mM. These Km values at pH 7.2 or 9.1 corresponded to the smaller of the biphasic Km values obtained without EDTA. In the absence of EDTA, no inhibition by Mg2+ was observed in the Mg2+ concentration range below 10 mM. In the presence of EDTA, the enzyme was inhibited markedly by Mg2+ at concentrations above 0.5 mM at pH 7.2, and was more sensitive to inhibition at pH 9.1. The effects of pH on the Km value for Mg2+ activation and on the Mg2+ inhibition contributed to an apparent shift of the pH optimum for activity induced by EDTA. Cooperative interaction among fructose-1, 6-diphosphate sites was observed for the enzyme in the presence of EDTA. The Hill coefficient was approximatley 1.8, and the apparent Km value for the substrate was 0.74 muM. EDTA appears to make liver fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase very sensitive to various effectors. It is suggested that Mg2+ serves as a regulator for the enzyme activity.\n",
      "Two molecular forms of thymidine kinase in the cytosol of regenerating rat liver. Two forms (Peak A and Peak B) of thymidine kinase [EC 2.7.1.75] from regenerating rat liver cytosol were resolved and partially purified by Deae-cellulose chromatography. Both fractions were identical with respect to their substrate requirement, pH optima, metal requirements, and molecular weight, as judged by their sedimentation in sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Peak B differed from Peak A in heat sensitivity, inhibition by dCTP and Km for thymidine and ATP. Peak B enzyme was the only enzyme found in normal adult liver and Peak A enzyme was the form increasing predominantly in regenerating liver.\n",
      "The modification of sulfhydryl groups of glutamine synthetase from Bacillus stearothermophilus with 5, 5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The SH groups of glutamine synthetase [EC 6.3.1.2] from Bacillus stearothermophilus were modified with 5, 5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in order to determine the number of SH groups in the molecule  as well as the effect of the modification on the enzyme activity. Three SH groups per subunit were detected after complete denaturation of the enzyme with 6 M urea, one of which was essential for the enzyme activity in view of its reactivity with 5, 5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) on addition of MgCl2 with loss of the activity. The CD spectra of the modified enzyme in the near ultraviolet region changed from that of the native enzyme, indicating that aromatic amino acid residues were affected by modification of the SH group. The fluorescence derived from tryptophanyl residue(s) was quenched depending on the extent of modification of the SH group, suggesting that the tryptophanyl residue(s) was located in the proximity of the SH group. The thermostability of the enzyme was remarkably decreased by modification of the SH group.\n",
      "Titration study of acetylated lysozyme. To study the interaction between carboxyl groups and amino groups in native lysozyme [EC 3.2.1.17], and to identify the positions and the pK values of the abnormal carboxyl groups, N-acetylated lysozyme was prepared. The acetylation did not affect the molecular shape of the enzyme, but changed six amino groups to a non-ionizable form, leaving one amino group free; this was determined to be Lys 33. In addition, pH titration of the acetylated lysozyme in 0.2 or 0.02 M KCl aqueous solution indicated fewer titratable groups with pK(int) of 7.8 or 10.4 compared with the native protein, though the number of titratable carboxyl groups was not affected by the acetylation. From the pH titration results and structural considerations, the unititratable carboxyl groups were suggested to be Asp 48, Asp 66, and Asp 87. On the other hand, spectrophotometric titration in 0.2 M KCl showed that all three tyrosine residues are titratable in the acetylated protein, although an abnormal tyrosine residue exists in the native state. Tyr 20 was suggested to be untitratable in the pH range of 8-12.6.\n",
      "Isolation of a low molecular weight active fragment of potato proteinase inhibitor IIb. A low molecular weight active fragment of potato proteinase inhibitor IIPB was obtained by incubating the inhibitor with an equimolar amount of trypsin [EC 3.4.21.4] at pH 8 and 30 degrees for 16 hr, followed by gel filtration through Sephadex G-50, treatment with trichloroacetic acid, and CM-cellulose chromatography. The purified active fragment consisted of a single peptide chain with a molecular weight of 4,300, comprising 39 amino acid residues. It retained very strong inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin [EC 3.4.21.1] and subtilisin [EC 3.4.21.14]. However, the yield of this active fragment was rather low and was variable. On further incubation with trypsin, it was converted into smaller inactive peptides.\n",
      "Isolation and characterization of a proteinase from the sarcocarp of melon fruit. A proteinase from the sarcocarp of melon (Cucumis Melo L. var. Prince) was purified by a three-step procedure involving batch-wise treatment with CM-cellulose fibers, column chromatography on CM-cellulose powder and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The final enzyme preparation was homogeneous on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its molecular weight was estimated by two different methods to be about 50,000. Anlayses indicated tha presence of 475 amino acid residues and at least 7 moles of hexose. The maximum activity was found in the alkaline pH region against casein as a substrate. The optimum temperature against casein was 70 degrees at pH 7.1. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, partly inhibited by HgCl2 and not inhibited by EDTA, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, N-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. The reduced and carboxymethylated insulin B-chain was cleaved at the peptide bonds of Asn3-Gln4, Cm-Cys7-Gly8, Glu13-Ala14, Leu15-Tyr16, Cm-Cys19-Gly20, Phe25-Tyr26, Pro28-Lys29, and Lys29-Ala30 by the enzyme.\n",
      "D-alpha-Hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase of Rhodospirillum rubrum. D-alpha-Hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase of R. rubrum grown anaerobically in the light was partially purified and some properties were investigated. 1. The enzyme catalyze stoichiometrically the dehydrogenation reaction of D-alpha-hydroxyglutarate into alpha-oxoglutarate, coupled with the reduction of 2, 6-dichlorophenolindophenol. 2. Cytochrome c2, cytochrome c, and ferricyanide are effective as electron acceptors with the crude enzyme but not with the purified one, whereas NAD+ and NADP+ are completely ineffective. The enzyme is thought to play a role in the electron transport system of the organism. 3. D-alpha-Hydroxyglutarate is virtually the sole substrate for the enzyme. The apparent activity against L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate is presumed to be due to contamination of the L-isomer sample with the D-isomer. The enzyme shows barely detectable activity against both isomers of malate and virtually no activity against DL-lactate and glycolate. 4. Both isomers of malate and oxalate, which are presumably substrate analogues, inhibit the enzyme activity. 5. The enzyme is not an inducible enzyme but rather is a constitutive one for R. rubrum, unlike from the enzyme of Pseudomonas putida which is an inducible enzyme for the catabolism of lysine.\n",
      "Effects of pH indicators on various activities of chromatophroes of Rhodospirillum rubrum. 1. The effects of pH indicators on activities for ATP hydrolysis in the dark and ATP-Pi exchange in the dark were examined with chromatophores from Rhodospirillum rubrum. Of thirty-one pH indicators tested, eleven (metanil yellow, 2, 4-dinitrophenol, ethyl orange, bromocresol green, resazurin, neutral red, bromthymol blue, alpha-naphtholphthalein, o-cresolphthalein, phenolphthalein, and alizarin yellow G) almost completely inhibited the activities for ATP formation and ATP-Pi exchange at concentrations of 1 mM, and were studied in detail. 2. Of the eleven pH indicators, those other than alpha-naptholphthalein, o-cresolphthalein and phenolphthalein, when assayed at appropriate concentrations, inhibited ATP-Pi exchange, but not ATP hydrolysis. In ATP-Pi exchange, these eight pH indicators at the concentrations described above were competitive against Pi, and non-competitive against ATP. The remaining three kinds of pH indicators were non-competitive against either Pi or ATP, when assayed at concentrations of the dyes that inhibited both activities. 3. The amounts of pH indicators bound with chromatophores were measured. No correlation was found between the amounts of the bound dyes and the extents of their inhibition of either ATP formation or ATP-Pi exchange. 4. Ethyl orange (pKa=4.1) and 2, 4-dinitrophenol (pKa=3.9) stimulated ATP hydrolysis to the greatest extent. The latter dye was hardly bound with chromatophores. 5. The stimulatory effects of pH indicators on ATP hydrolysis were hardly affected by extraction of quinones from chromatophores. 6. Most of the pH indicators stimulated both succinate-cytochrome c2 and NADH-cytochrome c2 reductions in the dark. 7. The mechanism of uncoupling of the electron transfer system and the phosphorylation system by pH indicators and the mechanism of the coupling are discussed.\n",
      "Binding of substrate analogues to subsites D, E, and F of hen egg-white lysozyme. The pH dependence of the binding of dye, Beibrich Scarlet, to hen egg-white lysozyme[EC 3.2.1.17] was studied at ionic strength 0.3 and 25 degrees by following circular dichroic (CD)bands originating from the bound dye. This binding involved one of the catalytic groups, Glu 35. The effect of the binding of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), its dimer or trimer on the binding of this dye was also studied at pH 7.5 by measuring changes in the CD bands of the dye bound to lysozyme. It was shown that there are two sites for simultaneous binding of these saccharides in the lysozyme molecule. The stronger binding of the saccharide was noncompetitive and the weaker binding was competitive with dye binding. The binding constants for the stronger binding site (the upper portion of lysozyme cleft) were in good agreement with those previously determined by following changes in the tryptophyl CD bands of lysozyme. The binding constants to the weaker site were about 1.1 x 10(-4), 5 x 10(2), and 5M(-1) for the trimer, dimer, and monomer of GlcNAc, respectively. Assuming that the trimer, dimer, and monomer occupy subsites D, E, and F; E and F; and E, respectively, the unitary free energies of saccharide binding were estimated to be about --1.9, --3.3, and --2.7 kcal/mole for D, E, and F, respectively.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of alkaline phosphatase from rat kidney. Alkaline phosphatase [EC 3.1.3.1.] was purified about 250-fold from rat kidney, and its enzymological properties were studied. Kidney homogenate was extracted with n-butanol, passed through Sephadex G-200 and chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose column. The peak from the DEAE-cellulose column was subjected to isoelectric focusing, and the alkaline phosphatase activity was separated into two peaks. The molecular weights of alkaline phosphatase in these peaks were 4.8.X10(4) and 1.0X10(5), as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anti-serum against alkaline phosphatase from rat kidney was prepared, and was shown to neutralize the activity from kidney, liver or bone, but not that from intestine.\n",
      "Studies on a microchemical method for the determination of the degree of polymerization of neutral oligo- and polysaccharides. I. Quantitative separation of trace amounts of alditols from mixtures with a large excess of monosaccharides. A method has been devised for the quantitative separation of trace amounts of alditols from mixtures with large amounts of monosaccharides, using a strongly basic ion-exchange resin. Ten kinds of common reducing monosaccharides used were strongly retained by a very basic anion-exchange resin in the hydroxyl form, whereas the corresponding alditols showed no significant affinity for the basic resin. Model studies showed excellent recoveries of alditol from known mixtures of alditol and the corresponding aldose at ratios in the range from 1 : 1X10(3) TO 1 : 1X10(4) (by weight). Application of this procedure to dextrans after reduction and hydrolysis resulted in quantitative separation of the terminal alditol.\n",

      "Interaction of cyclodextrins with fluorescent probes and its application to kinetic studies of amylase. It was found that 6-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-2-sulfonate (TNS) showed pronounced fluorescence enhancement when it was added to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin solutions. 2. The following results were obtained by quantitative study of the interactions of three kinds of cyclodextrins with TNS by following TNS fluorescence at pH5.3. and 25 degrees. i) alpha-Cyclodextrin forms a l : l complex with TNS. ii) beta- and gamma-Cyclodextrins form 1 : 1 and also 2 : 1 complexes; in the latter two cyclodextrin molecules bind to one TNS molecule. iii) The dissociation constants of cyclodextrin-TNS complexes were determined to be 54.9 mM for alpha-cyclodextrin, 0.65 mM for beta-cyclodextrin and 0.66 mM for gamma-cyclodextrin in the 1 : 1 complex, and the secondary dissociation constants in the 2 : 1 complex were 71.4 mM for beta-cyclodextrin in the 1 : 1 complex, and the secondary dissociation constants in the 2 : 1 complex were 71.4 mM for beta-cyclodextrin and 32.6 mM for gamma-cyclodextrin. iv)...\n",
      "Fluorine-19 as a covalent active site-directed magnetic resonance probe in aspartate transaminase. Phosphypyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine has been synthesized as an active site-directed 19F NMR probe for aspartate transaminase. This coenzyme derivative adds stoichiometrically to the apotransaminase as observed by both fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. The fluorinated phosphypyridoxamine derivative, when bound to the apotransaminase, will not dissociate upon extensive dialysis or passage through Sephadex G-25. The compound behaves as a pyridoxamine phosphate derivative and not as a coenzyme-substrate complex, since both competing anions and dicarboxylic acid inhibitors still bind to the phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine enzyme. The 19F NMR spectra of the enzyme-bound phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine were measured as a function of pH, ionic strength, and temperature. The 19F MNR of the enzyme-bound coenzyme derivative revealed no predetermined asymmetry in the subunits of aspartate transaminase insolution in terms of differences in chemical shift or resonance line shape between the two environments. A pH-dependent chemical shift change of the single 19F resonance was observed, which is consistent with the influence of a single ionization with an apparent pKa of 8.4 in 0.10 M KCl at 30 degrees. Increasing the ionic strength resulted in increasing values for the observed pKa, the highest recorded value was 9.1 in 3.0 M KCl. The temperature dependence of the pH titration of the chemical shift gives deltaH' of ionization of 10.5 kcal/mol. The evidence suggests a possible epsilon-amino group, electrostatically affected by positive charges, being responsible for the titration effect of the active site-bound fluorine derivative of pyridoxamine phosphate.\n",
      "Spot hemoglobin. Studies on the Root effect hemoglobin of a marine teleost. The Spot, Leiostomus xanthrus, has a single tetrameric hemoglobin. Structural studies indicate the presence of alpha- and beta-like chains with COOH-terminal sequences of --Arg and --TYR-His, respectively, the same as is found in human hemoglobin. Spot hemoglobin possesses a Root effect: a heterotropic control mechanism like the Bohr effect but with more extreme pH dependence in the equilibria and kinetics of O2 and CO binding. The Root effect seems to be a molecular adaptation, in that pH- and anion-sensitive hemoglobins may help fish achieve neutral buoyancy by facilitating O2 delivery to the swim bladder. Changes in the kinetics of both \"on\" and \"off\" processes contribute to the greatly decreased ligand affinity of Spot hemoglobin at low pH. The time course ofligand combination at low pH is biphasic and wavelength dependent, suggesting a differential effect of pH on the alpha- and beta-like chains. The change in the shape of the ligand-binding curve with pH may be interpreted in terms of a proton-dependent transition between low (T) and high (R) affinity conformations. However, this may not be the only mechanism, since differential pH effects on the two types of chains may also contribute to the observed pH dependence.\n",
      "Site-site interactions among insulin receptors. Characterization of the negative cooperativity. By studying the dissociation of 125I-instulin from its receptors in the absence and phe negatively cooperative type for the insulin receptors. In the present study we extend oy purified mouse and rat liver membranes as well as in human circulating monocytes and human cultured lymphocytes demonstrated negative cooperativity that was extraordinarily simn membranes more slowly than it does from its receptors on whole cells. The dissociaty a small percentage of the receptor sites (1 to 5%), are sufficient to accelerate dissociation of hormone from receptor. At these insulin concentrations insulin is entirely monomeric, and in fact at higher concentrations of insulin (greater than 10(-7) M) where insulin dimers predominate, the cooperativity effect is progressively lost. The dissociation rate of 125I-insulin alone (that is at very low fractional saturation of receptors) was markedly accelerated by dripping the pH from 8.0 to 5.0, whereas the dissociation of 125I-insulin at high receptor occupancy was only slightly accelerated by the fall in pH. The dissociation rate was directly related to temperature, but the dissociation rate of 125I-insulin at low receptor occupancy was much more affected by reduction in temperature and showed a sharp transition at 21 degrees. Urea at concentrations as low as 1 M produced a marked acceleration of 125I-insulin dissociation. Divalent cations (calcium and magnesium) appear to stabilize the insulin-receptor interaction, since higher degrees of receptor occupancy were required to achieve a given rate of dissociation of 125I-insulin. These data make it likely that the insulin receptors exist as oligomeric structures or clusters in the plasma membrane. Insulin receptor sites appear to switch from a \"slow dissociating\" state to a \"fast dissociating\" state when their occupancy increases; the proportion of sites in each state is a function of occupancy of the receptor sites by the insulin monomer as well as of the physiochemical environment. Other models which could explain apparent negative cooperativity besides site-site interactions, i.e. polymerization of the hormone, steric or electrostatic hindrance due to ligand-ligand interactions, or unstirred (Noyes-Whitney) layers are considered unlikely in the case of insulin receptors on both experimental and theoretical grounds.\n",
      "Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase. II. Enzyme phosphorylation state and effector concentrations as interacting control parameters. The effects of several inhibitors (ATP, ADP, AMP, UDP, and P1) and activators (Mg2+, glucose-6-P) of rabbit muscle glycogen synthase (UDP-glucose:glycogen 4-alpha-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.11) were studied in relation to the phosphorylation state of the purified enzyme. All the modifiers had increasing effects with enzyme of increasing alkali-labile phosphate content. In experiments where combinations of effectors were present, it was apparent that (a) concentrations of modifiers in the physiological range could be significant in determining enzymic activity and (b) the sensitivity of the reaction rate to changes in phosphorylation state was critically dependent on the concentration of the small molecules. Changes in the phosphorylation of the enzyme corresponding to changes in the %I activity reported in the literature for studies in vivo were capable of producing large alterations in glycogen synthase activity. Because the magnitudes of such changes were dependent on the effector concentrations, there may be an integration of local cellular control, through small molecule effects, with hormonal control, through the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase.\n",
      "Kinetic study of the action of snake venom phospholipase A2 on human serum high density lipoprotein 3. The hydrolysis of the phospholipids of intact human serum high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) by pure alpha-phospholipase A2 from Crotalus adamanteus was studied by pH-stat titration. The enzyme quantitatively hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and left sphinogomyelin intact, yielding a stable and water-soluble modified HDL. Lysophospholipids and free fatty acids, the products of hydrolysis, remained in the lipoprotein. When 1 mol of defatted bovine serum albumin/mol of substrate phospholipids was added to the reaction mixture, up to 60% of the fatty acids and 85% of the lysophospholipids were removed from the modified lipoprotein. The immunological reactivity of the hydrolyzed HDL remained unaltered in both the presence and absence of albumin. The changes in the physical properties of the lipoprotein during hydrolysis were rather small, the most notable being an increase in the hydrated density and in the electrophoretic mobility in alkaline buffers. The hydrolysis followed an apparent first order time course with product inhibition (KI) and yielded values of kcat/Km = 7 X 10(5 M(-1)s(-1) and KI congruent to 1 X 10(-4) M. Addition of albumin to the reaction mixture relieved the product inhibition without any alteration of the kinetic parameters. High concentrations of albumin protected some of the substrate phospholipids from hydrolysis, presumably through complexation to the lipoprotein. The Arrhenius plot for the experimental first order rate constant in the absence of albumin (kexp = kcat (KI/Km)) was linear between 15 degrees and 47 degrees, indicating the absence of any phospholipid phase transitions and yielding an activation energy of 15.2 kcal/mol. From the accessibility of the HDL phospholipids to phospholipase A2 one concludes that the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are located at, or are in rapid equilibrium with, the surface of this lipoprotein. It also appears that these phospholipids are not essential for maintaining the supramolecular properties of the lipoprotein in vitro. Thsu the study of the modified Hdl should provide valuable information concenring the structure and function of this lipoprotein particularly with regard to the role played by shiingomyelin.\n",
      "Regulation of steady state level of phosphoenzyme and ATP synthesis in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles during reversal of the Ca2+ pump. The role of the Ca2+ concentration gradient in ATP synthesis and membrane phosphorylation by Pi was investigated in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. The Pi concentration required to attain 50% of the maximal membrane phosphorylation varies significantly in the pH range of 5.5 to 4.5, the optimal being at pH 6.0. In the pH range of 6.0 to 7.0, this concentration of Pi was 4- to 10-fold higher in empty vesicles than in vesicles loaded with calcium phosphate, i.e. having transmembrane Ca2+ concentration gradient. ATP, ADP, and Ca2+ inhibit the membrane phosphorylation by Pi, the inhibition being greater at pH 7.0 than at pH 6.0. The pH profile for ATP synthesis shows a higher optimum than for membrane phosphorylation. The optimum pH for synthesis, but not for phosphorylation depends on whether the vesicles were previously loaded with calcium phosphate or with calcium oxalate. Addition of Ca2+ to the assay medium inhibits the extent of membrane phosphorylation and the rate of ATP synthesis to different extents. Evidence is presented that the rate of membrane phosphorylation by Pi is higher than the rate by which the phosphoprotein transfers its pohsphate to ADP for the ATP synthesis.\n",
      "Acetyl coenzyme A carbosylase. Circular dichroism studies of Escherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein. The biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) component of Escherichia coli acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and three peptides derived from BCCP by proteolytic digestion have been examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. BCCP, which has a peptide molecular weight of 22,500, has a spectrum typical of globular proteins with negative extrema at 222 nm and 208 nm. The two smallest peptides, BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100), with molecular weights of 8,900 and 9,100, respectively, exhibit unusual positive CD bands centered at 237 nm and 220 nm. BCCP(10,400), with a molecular weight of 10,400, has a CD spectrum intermediate between BCCP and that of the smallest peptides. Since d-biotin exhibits a positive CD band at 233 nm, it was suspected that the biotin prosthetic group might be the chromophore responsible for the 237 nm CD band seen in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100). Enzymatic carboxylation of BCCP(SC) to form CO2-BCCP(SC) caused the CD spectrum to change with a shift of the 237 nm band to 232 nm. The positive CD band at 220 nm was unaffected by carboxylation of the biotin prosthetic group. These date suggest that the 237 nm signal may be due either to the biotin which acts as a chromophore directly or to a chromophore that is perturbed by the carboxylation of biotin. A spectropolarimetric titration was carried out to investigate the possible contribution of the single tyrosine residue of BCCP(SC) to the CD spectrum of this peptide. At pH values over 9 the CD spetrum changed with the disappearance of the 237 nm band, suggesting that tyrosine might contribute to this CD band. Denaturation of BCCP(SC) or BCCP(9,100) with 8 M urea of 6 M guanidine HCl abolished the positive CD bands and resulted in spectra typical of a random coil, whereas treatment of BCCP(SC) with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate abolished the positive bands and left a spectrum exhibiting a shoulder at 222 nm and a negative band at 205 nm, suggestive of a high degree of ordered structure. It is concluded that the CD band at 237 nm in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100) is prabably due to a noncovalent interaction of biotin with an amino acid residue(s) of the protein. It is suggested that the biotin prosthetic group is partially buried in the surface of the protein, rather than swinging free at the end of the lysine side chain through which it is covalently linked to the protein, to permit this interaction to occur.\n",
      "Pulse radiolytic investigation of single heme group reduction in hum an methemoglobin. Reduction of one of the four heme groups of human aquomethemoglobin A has been investigated by the pulse radiolysis method. The reactivity of e-a-q, the hydrated electron, with methemoglobin was determined by observing this species directly.

      "Enzymatic attack on side chains of synthetic polymers. Chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of specific substrate groups attached to acrylamide or acrylic acid co-polymers. Three vinyl monomers, M-1, M-3, and M-5, in which L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide was acylated with CH2==CHCONH(CH2)nCO--(n = 1, 3, 5) were synthesized. They were co-polymerized with a large excess of acrylamide (co-polymers PAm-1, PAm-3, and PAm-5) and with a large excess of acrylic acid (co-polymers PAc=1, PAc-3, and PCc-5). In addition, M-5 was co-polymerized with acrylamide containing 2.8 mol % of the hydrophobic monomer N-acrylyl-1-naphthylamine (co-polymer PAm-5N). The rates of the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitroanilide groups of M-5 and the various co-polymers were determined over a range of pH. For some of the systems data were also obtained over a range of substrate concentrations to derive values for Vmax and Km. Results obtained with PAm-5 were found to be independent of the chain length of the co-polymer. At pH 7, 25 degrees and with 2.7 X 10(-6) M enzyme, Vmax values for M-5, PAm-k, PAm-5N, and PAc-5 were 5.5, 5.5, 10, and 3.6 X 10(-8) M/S, while Km values were 8.5, 16.5, 10, and 2.2 X 10(-5),respectively, With PAc-5, the pH activity profile was shifted to higher acidities as compared to the profiles obtained with M-5 and PAm-5. The susceptibility of the co-polymers to chymotrypsin attack decreases sharply with a decreasing spacing of the L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide residue from the backbone of the polymer chains.\n",
      "Purification and properties of a highly potent antitumor glutaminase-asparaginase from Pseudomonas 7Z. Crystalline glutaminase-asparaginase which is effective against solid as well as ascites tumors was prepared from soil isolate organism Pseudomonas 7A. This enzyme has a ration of Vmax for L-glutamine and L-asparagine of 2.0. The presence of glutamic acid in the growth medium is essential for optimal enzyme production and glucose inhibits the production of glutaminase-asparaginase. The purification procedure provides an overall yield of 40 to 45% from crude cell extract to homogeneous glutaminase-asparaginase and is adaptable to large scale production of the enzyme. The specific activity of homogeneous enzyme is 160 +/- 15 i.u./mg of protein and the E1% 280 is 9.8. No disulfide or sulfhydryl groups appear to be present on the enzyme. The isoelectric point of glutaminase-asparaginase by isoelectric focusing on ampholine polyacrylamide gel plates is 5.8. The Km values for L-glutamine and L-asparagine are 4.6 and 4.4 X 10(-6) M, respectively. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the D isomers of glutamine and asparagine at 87 and 69% the rate of the respective L isomers. L-Glutamic acid gamma-monohydroxamate is hydrolyzed at approximately the same rate as L-glutamine. The enzyme is not inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate (0.1 mM), L-glutamate (30 mM), or L-aspartate (30 mM). Ammonium sulfate (10 mM) inhibits the enzymatic activity.

      "Regulation of secretion from the adrenal medulla. Evidence for adenylate cyclase activity in secretory vesicle membranes. Adenylate cyclase activity has been found in purified secretory vesicle membranes from the adrenal medulla. Activity was detected both by formation of radioactive cAMP from [alpha-32P]ATP and by the competitive protein binding assay for cAMP. Activity was highest at pH 8.0 to 8.5, and was stimulated by sodium fluoride and GppNHp, a GTP analogue known to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in plasma membrane preparations. The reaction rate was strongly dependent on the molar ratio of Mg2+:ATP in the system. This is the first demonstration of adenylate cyclase in a secretory vesicle membrane.\n",
      "In vivo inhibition of superoxide dismutase in mice by diethyldithiocarbamate. Superoxide dismutase was assayed by a method which takes advantage of the inhibitory action of superoxide dismutase (or tissues which contain superoxide dismutase) on the rate of autooxidation of 6-hydroxydopamine. Incubation of pure superoxide dismutase of homogenates of brain or liver with 10(-3) M diethyldithiocarbamate for 1.5 hours resulted in total loss of superoxide dismutase activity. Inhibition of superoxide dismutase was not reversed by dialysis, but after dialysis, enzymatic activity was restored with CuSO4. When 1.5 g of diethyldithiocarbamate/kg were injected into mice, the superoxide dismutase activity at 3 hours was decreased by 86%, 71%, and 48%, respectively, in whole blood, liver, and brain. A dose of 0.5 g of diethyldithiocarbamate/kg lowered the superoxide dismutase activity by 42% in liver at 3 hours. A study of the time course for inhibiton of superoxide dismutase in liver after 1.5 g of diethyldithiocarbamate/kg, showed a maximum decrease (81%) within 1 hour, with a slow return to 64% of normal by 24 hours. Inhibition of superoxide dismutase in vivo and in vitro was confirmed with other assay systems based on the autooxidation of pyrogallol or epinephrine or on reduction of cytochrome c or intro blue tetrazolium. Treatment of animals with diethyldithiocarbamate may provide a useful experimental model to study the role of superoxide dismutase in various tissues.\n",
      "Internal pH of isolated chromaffin vesicles. The passive permeability of isolated chromaffin vesicles to H+ and the internal pH of the vesicles under various conditions were measured. Potentiometric measurements of K+ and H+ fluxes in the presence of selected ionophores and uncouplers indicated that the membrane is highly impermeable to both protons and potassium. deltapH across the chromaffin granule membrane was measured by [14C]methylamine distribution. At pH 6.85, The deltapH WAS 1.16 WITH THE INTRAVESICULAR SPACE BEING FOUND ACIDIC. Varying the external pH produced an equivalent change in the deltapH, WITH EXTRAPOLATION TO ZERO DEltapH yielding a value of pH  5.5, WHICH IS TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE PH of the intravesicular space. The pH gradient could be enhanced or collapsed by the addition of ionophores and uncouplers under varying ionic conditions. deltapH was constant for granules suspended in various ionic media, suggesting that the deltapH did not arise secondarily due to the establishment of a Donnan equilibrium. The significance of the proton impermeability and deltapH is discussed in terms of regulation of the uptake and storage of catecholamines in bovine chromaffin granules.\n",
      "Triglyceride, diglyceride, monoglyceride, and cholesterol ester hydrolases in chicken adipose tissue activated by adenosine 3':5'-Monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. Chromatographic resolution and immunochemical differentiation from lipoprotein lipase. Hormone-sensitive lipase and cholesterol ester hydrolase of chicken adipose tissue were markedly activated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (on the average, 235 to 275%; occasionally as much as 1000%). Diglyceride and monoglyceride hydrolases were also activated, but to a lesser extent (60 to 87%). The activation of all four hydrolases was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor and reversed by the addition of exogenous protein kinase. Following activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, all four hydrolases were deactivated in a Mg2+-dependent reaction and then reactivated to or near initial levels on incubation with cAMP and Mg2+-ATP. The reversible deactivation is assumed to reflect activity of one or more protein phosphatases. The maximum activation obtainable for the four hydrolases decreased when the tissue had been previously exposed to glucagon, indicating that the glucagon-induced activation was probably similar to or identical with the activation demonstrated in cell-free preparations. The pH optima for the four hydrolase activities were similar (7.13 to 7.38). Although the absolute activities and relative degrees of kinase activation differed according to the particular emulsified substrates used, the results do not rule out the possibility that all four hydrolase activities are referable to a single hormone-sensitive hydrolase. Hormone-sensitive acyl hydrolases were separated from lipoprotein lipase by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Lipoprotein lipase was active against triolein, diolein, and monoolein, but not cholesterol oleate. Incubation of lipoprotein lipase with exogenous protein kinase, cAMP, and Mg2+ATP had no effect on any of the three hydrolase activities. Lipoprotein lipase was further purified to homogeneity and used to prepare antiserum in rabbits. The immunoglobin G fraction from these antisera completely inhibited lipoprotein lipase eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns. However, the hormone-sensitive hydrolase activities (not retained on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography) were not inhibited by anti-lipoprotein lipase immunoglobin G, and anti-lopoprotein lipase immunoglobin G did not affect the activation process in crude fractions. Thus, hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase, functionally distinct enzymes, have been physically resolved and immunochemically distinguished. Apparently lipoprotein lipase activity is not regulated, at least directly, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.\n",

For purposes of comparison, binding isotherms for [4-glycine-1-(14)C]oxytocin to neurophysin II and I in aqueous buffer, and [9-glycinamide-1-(14)C]oxytocin to neurophysin II in dimethylsulfoxide under selected conditions are also reported. A brief discussion of the interpretation of binding isotherms is entered into and apparent binding constants are derived. The results indicate that the interpretations presented in the literature up to now are much too simple. There are, in contrast, multiple binding sites of oxytocin and vasopressin to the neurophysins and large temperature dependences of the number of sites and their binding constants. We find, in fact, that at 37 degrees the binding of neurohypophysial hormones to the supposed storage proteins is rather weak even at the pH of maximum binding.\n",
      "Inhibition of bovine hepatic fructose-1,6-diphosphatase by substrate analogs. Purified bovine hepatic fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, which exhibits maximal activity at neutral pH, is competitively inhibited by several analogs of its substrate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate. These include glucose 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 9.4 X 10(-5) M), hexitol 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 2.3 X 10(-4) M), and 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 3.3 X 10(-8) M), and 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol 1,6-diphosphate (Ki = 5.5 X 10(-7) M). The Ki values for both 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate and 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol 1,6-diphosphate are lower than the Km of 1.4 X 10(-6) M for fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Since 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate is an analog of the beta anomer of fructose 1,6-diphosphate and 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol 1,6-diphosphate is an analog of the alpha anomer, the lower Ki for the mannitol analog may indicate that the beta anomer of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which predominates in solution, is the true substrate. The substrate analog 1,5-pentanediol diphosphate inhibits slightly (K0.5 = 5 X 10(-3) M), but 1,4-cyclohexyldiol diphosphate does not. The Ki for product inhibition by sodium phosphate is 9.4 X 10(-3) M. 2,5-Anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate and alpha-D-glucose 1,6-diphosphate are substrates at pH 9.0, but not at pH 6.5.\n",
      "Genetic variants of human erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of variants A, B, and A- in relation to quaternary structure. The values of Vmax and Km for the three genetic variants A, B, and A- of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase have been determined at 10 different pH values in the range from 5.5 to 9.5, and at four different temperatures in the range from 18.5-40.0 degrees. The log Vmax versus pH curve for each of the enzymes shows a monotonic increase between pH 5.5 and 7, and a plateau from pH 7.5 upwards. These curves, and their temperature dependence, are compatible with the presence of a single ionizable group which, in its conjugate acid form, renders the enzyme-substrate complex inactive. The pK of this group is 6.94 at 18.5 degrees, and its enthalpy of ionization is 7.0 kcal mol-1. The log Km versus pH curves show a broad plateau between pH 6.2 and 8.2, interrupted by a sharp minimum at pH 7.2 for variant B, while variants A and A- show sharp maxima at pH 7.2 and 7.45, respectively. It is proposed that this unusual behavior depends on the dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme to dimers in this pH region. Specifically, it is shown that  a sharp maximum or minimum of Km can arise if cooperative uptake or release of protons is linked to dimer formation, and if the degree of cooperativity is different for the free enzyme compared to the enzyme-substrate complex. The pH dependence of the equilibrium between the tetrameric and the dimeric form of the enzyme has been determined by gel filtration for the same three genetic variants B, A, and A-. In agreement with previous ultracentrifugal data, the enzyme is a tetramer in acid solution and a dimer in alkaline solution. The pH at which half of the enzyme is in dimeric form, under our experimental conditions, is 7.15 +/- 0.05 for variants A and B, and 7.35 +/- 0.05 for variant A-. These pH values correspond closely, for all three variants, to the sharp extrema in the pH dependence of their Km values for glucose 6-phosphate. From the measured dissociation equilibria, it can be inferred that the tetramer-dimer transition entails cooperative release of protons. The degree of cooperativity estimated from these data agrees closely with the independent estimate based on the pH dependence of Km.\n",
      "Studies on tyrosine residues in porcine muscle adenylate kinase. Circular dichroism spectra and chemical modification with tetranitromethane. Substrate-induced conformational change of porcine muscle adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) is evidenced by a change in circular dichroism spectra in the near ultraviolet. In the absence of tryptophan in porcine muscle adenylate kinase, the spectral change may be assigned to a perturbation of tyrosine chromophore(s). The spectral change was specific for adenine nucleotide binding and was greater with ATP than with AMP. In the x-ray model, Tyr153 and Tyr154 are located at a hinge region of two domains which form a deep active site cleft and are therefore susceptible to conformational change on substrate binding. Adenylate kinase was treated with equimolar tetranitromethane. The yellow-colored product, separated from unmodified enzyme by substrate gradient elution on a phosphocellulose column, had about 1 mol of nitrotyrosine per mol of the enzyme by amino acid analysis and showed a slightly higher Km value than native enzyme for ADP (Km = 0.50 mM compared with 0.25 mM for native adenylate kinase). Spectrophotometric titration of nitroadenylate kinase gave pKa 8.4 for the dissociation constant of the nitrotyrosyl hydroxyl group. On binding ATP the pKa value increased to 9.0 while AMP binding caused very little change. By peptide mapping of the carboxypeptidase digestion product, 0.70 mol of nitro group per mol of adenylate kinase was detected on Tyr153 and a small amount of nitro group was also found on Tyr95. From these results it is proposed that Tyr153 is directly or indirectly involved in the binding of ATP.\n",
      "Antifreeze glycoproteins from Antarctic fish. Inactivation by borate. Antifreeze glycoprotein, which has previously been shown to be inactive in the presence of borate, migrates electrophoretically as the borate complex, presumably through formation of borate complexes with hydroxyl groups on the sugar side chains. Antifreeze glycoprotein (5 mg/ml) has been found to be completely active in the presence of 0.1 M borate at pH 7, but inactive at pH 9. A titration curve of pH versus the antifreeze activity of glycoprotein (5 mg/ml) in 0.1 M borate showed a progressive decrease in antifreeze activity as the pH was increased. Concomitant with decreases in activity were increases in binding of borate. At pH 9.0, nearly 2 mol of borate were complexed per glycotripeptide. Ultracentrifuge analyses showed similar molecular weights and laser quasi-elastic light scattering showed similar diffusions at pH 7.0 and 9.0 in borate and in the absence of borate. The binding of borate, rather than a change in conformation, is thus directly related to the loss of antifreeze activity. Alkaline borate also decreased hemagglutinating activity of Osage orange lectin and decreased the inhibition of the activity by the antifreeze glycoproteins.\n",
      "Binding of (3H)prostaglandin E1 to putative receptors linked to adenylate cyclase of cultured cell clones. A method for assessing the binding of 3H-labeled prostaglandin E1 ([3H]PGE1) to cell membranes has been developed and used to study the interaction of [3H]PGE1 with membranes from cultured mammalian cells. Receptor sites were identified by correlation of the potency of a series of compounds to compete for [3H]PGE1 binding sites and to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, by correlation of rates of binding and change in enzyme activity, and by the correspondence of [3H]PGE1-binding activity with the presence or absence of PGE1-sensitive adenylate cyclase in several clones. In clone B82, a murine L-cell, [3H]PGE1 binds with an activation energy of 14 kcal/mol to a class of sites with an affinity of 0.5 X 10(8) M-1 and a capacity of 150 fmol/mg of protein. Concentration dependence of adenylate cyclase activation by PGE1 (KD =30 nM) and kinetic analysis of [3H]PGE1 binding (k1 = 4 X 10(6) liters/mol/min, k-1 0.15/min) verify this affinity. Concentration dependence and specificity of binding and activation of adenylate cyclases in neuroblastoma clone N4TG1 and N18TG2 substantiate the method. In several clones that lack PGE1-responsive adenylate cyclase, no specific [3H]PGE1 binding is detectable.\n",
      "The mechanism of superoxide anion generation by the interaction of phenylhydrazine with hemoglobin. The mechanism by which superoxide anion is generated by the interaction of phenylhydrazine with either oxy- or methemoglobin was investigated. Rather than superoxide anion generation resulting from an accelerated autooxidation of oxyhemoglobin, it was found that both oxy- and methemoglobin function as peroxidases toward phenylhydrazine with the resultant oxidation of this compound to phenyldiazine. Generation of phenyldiazine from the oxidation of phenylhydrazine by hemoglobin or by the hydrolysis and subsequent decarboxylation of methyl phenylazoformate (C6H5N=NCOOCH3) resulted in the production of superoxide anion. It is suggested that under certain conditions hemoglobin may function as a drug-metabolizing peroxidase.\n",
      "Affinity labeling of a previously undetected essential lysyl residue in class I fructose bisphosphate aldolase. The affinity label N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate (BrAcNHEtOP) has been used previously at pH 6.5 to identify His-359 of rabbit muscle aldolase as an active site residue. We now find that the specificity of the reagent is pH-dependent. At pH 8.5, alkylation with 14C-labeled BrAcNHEtOP abolishes both fructose-1,6-P2 cleavage activity and transaldolase activity. The stoichiometry of incorporation, the kinetics of inactivation, and the protection against inactivation afforded by a competitive inhibitor or dihydroxyacetone phosphate are consistent with the involvement of an active site residue. A comparison of 14C profiles obtained from chromatography on the amino acid analyzer of acid hydrolysates of inactivated and protected samples reveals that inactivation results from the alkylation of lysyl residues. The major peptide in tryptic digests of the inactivated enzyme has been isolated. Based on its amino acid composition and the known sequence of aldolase, Lys-146 is the residue preferentially alkylated by the reagent. Aldolase modified at His-359 is still subject to alkylation of lysine; thus Lys-146 and His-359 are not mutually exclusive sites. However, aldolase modified at Lys-146 is not subject to alkylation of histidine. One explanation of these observations is that modification of Lys-146 abolishes the binding capacity of aldolase for substrates and substrate analogs (BrAcNHEtOP), whereas modification of his-359 does not. Consistent with this explanation is the ability of aldolase modified at His-359 to form a Schiff base with substrate and the inability of aldolase modified at Lys-146 to do so. Therefore, Lys-146 could be one of the cationic groups that functions in electrostatic binding of the substrate's phosphate groups.\n",
      "Purification and characterization of a repressible alkaline phosphatase from Thermus aquaticus. A repressible alkaline phosphatase has been isolated from the extreme bacterial thermophile, Thermus aquaticus. The enzyme can be derepressed more than 1,000-fold by starving the cells for phosphate. In derepressed cells, nearly 6% of the total protein in a cell-free enzyme preparation is alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity as judged by disc acrylamide electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. By sucrose gradient centrifugation it was established that the enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 143,000 and consists of three subunits, each with a molecular weight of 51,000. Tris buffer stimulates the activity of the enzyme, which has a pH optimum of 9.2. The enzyme has a broad temperature range with an optimum of 75-80 degrees. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide variety of phosphorylated compounds as do many of the mesophilic alkaline phosphatases. The Michaelis constant(Km) for the enzyme is 8.0 X 10(-4) M. Amino acid analysis of the protein revealed little in the amino acid composition to separate it from other mesophilic enzymes which have been previously studied.\n",
      "Association of gylcogenolysis with cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments isolated from dog cardiac muscle possess a calcium-accumulating system associated with a series of enzymes linked to glycogenolysis. These enzymes include: adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase b kinase, phosphorylase (b/a, 30/1),\"debrancher\" enzyme, and glycogen (0.3 to 0.7 mg/mg of protein). The sarcoplasmic reticulum preparation produced glucose 1-phosphate and glucose from either endogenous or exogenous glycogen. Both the calcium-accumulating and glycogenolytic enzymes sediment in a single peak at 33% sucrose on a linear continous sucrose density gradient, and the complex remains intact throughout repeated washing. Glycogen particles appear to be associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum in situ as well as in the isolated microsomal fraction. The sarcoplasmic reticulum-glycogenolytic complex, monitored by a linked enzyme spectrophotometric assay, shows several features: (a) activation of phosphorylase activity to peak rate occurs over a very rapid time course which cannot be duplicated using combinations of purified enzymes; (b) activation is inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor; (c) phosphorylase b functions as in the purified form with respect to AMP (Km, 0.3 mM); (d) in the presence of limiting amounts of glycogen, optimal phosphorylase b activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum requires the presence of debrancher, and the activity is sensitive to inhibitors of that enzyme such as Tris, which suggests the possiblity that the enzymes bear a specific structual relationship to the glycogen present. Phosphorylase b leads to a activation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was completely resistant to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl either)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Inhibition of calcium accumulation by or release of bound calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum by X537A (RO 2-2985) did not alter the EGTA resistance. These results suggest that cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is a complex organelle containing functions that may be related to excitation-contraction coupling and intermediary metabolism.\n",
      "Purification and properties of a virion protein kinase. The protein kinase associated with virions of frog virus 3 was purified to apparent homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The enzyme protein appeared as a single polypeptide of molecular weight 50,000 to 55,000 as determined by gel filtration, glycerol gradient sedimentation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and comprised approximately 0.4% of the total virion protein. The activity was classified as a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase as it was not effected by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate, or inhibited by a cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor protein, and utilized GTP as well as ATP as a phosphate donor. The greatest rates of phosphorylation were obtained with acidic phosphoprotein substrates such as casein or phosvitin, although potential physiological substrates for this activity included specific virion polypeptides of frog virus.\n",
      "The interaction of macromolecular solutions with macromolecular monolayers adsorbed on a hydrophobic surface. In order to elucidate the general patterns of intermacromolecular surface interactions that may be involved in hemocompatibility phenomena, monolayers of representative macromolecules on an octadecylsilylated glass surface were exposed to solutions of other macromolecules, and the changes in interfacial composition were characterized by zeta potential-pH titration curves, as measured by alternating flow streaming current analysis and, in some cases, by radiotracer labeling. Experiments with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), a blood-compatible linear polymer; bovine serum albumin (BSA), a representative serum protein; whole human serum (HS), a complex mixture of proteins; and erythrocyte surface glycoprotein (GP), an extended-chain macromolecular amphiphile, showed the following: 1) Penetration of the original monolayer occurred within 24 hr in 9 of the 12 possible cases; it did not occur for BSA or HS monolayers exposed to PVP, and probably not for PVP exposed to GP. 2) In all cases, penetration was accompanied by no more than partial displacement of the original monolayer, thereby generating a mixed monolayer. Each of the six possible binary mixed monolayers could be obtained by at least one of the two possible mixing sequences. 3) In the three binary systems containing BSA, the formation of the mixed monolayer could be related to increased adsorption in the two-component system. 4) The two components of the mixed monolayers were not equally distributed across their thicknesses: thus, the outer surfaces of the PVP-BSA and (at neutral pH) the PVP-HS mixed monolayers contained only PVP; that of the BSA-HS mixtures only HS. In the PVP-HS, and probably the GP-BSA and GP-HS mixed monolayers, the composition of the outer surface appeared pH-dependent. The resultant zeta potential versus pH profiles in the latter two cases resembled those of intact blood cells. The results suggest that neither the compact monolayers of globular proteins nor the diffuse monolayers of randomly coiled water-soluble polymers can, by their prior adsorption on a synthetic surface, prevent the subsequent adsorption of other globular macromolecules. It is possible that the randomly coiled polymers may impede the adhesion of platelets to the substrate since the results indicate that the adsorption of such polymers causes a displacement of the shear plane.\n",
      "Stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity in chick fibroblasts by non-suppressible insulin-like activity (NSILA), insulin and serum. A factor isolated from human serum (nonsuppressible insulin-like activity, NSILA) stimulates multiplication of serum-starved chick embryo fibroblasts and stimulates activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Physiological doses of NSILA (200 muU/ml) and pharmacological doses of insulin (200 mU/ml) stimulate ODC 4-5-fold, 10% fetal calf serum about 18-fold. Combined addition of NSILA and insulin does not result in higher activities, suggesting a common mechanism of action. The increase in cell number obtained with NSILA, insulin or serum parallels the degree of ODC stimulation. Treatment of cells with pronase also stimulates ODC activity. A sharp increase in ODC activity occurs between 2, 5 and 5.0 hours after addition of the growth factors with a peak at 4.0-4.5 hours (\"activation period\"). As cells leave G1 phase, ODC activity decreases rapidly. To achieve maximal activity of ODC, the growth factors have to be present during the entire \"activation period.\" The potential to reactivate ODC decreases as cells pass through S phase. Results obtained using cycloheximide suggest that ODC is translated only in the second half of the \"activation period.\" Data on effects of dbcAMP and dbcGMP on ODC activation by serum are discussed.\n",

      "A reversed-phase thin-layer chromotographic method for the determination of relative partition coefficients of very lipophilic compounds. A reversed-phase thin-layer chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of partition coefficients. A support phase has been chosen, following investigation of the lack of adsorptive properties, which has a minimal effect on the pH of the buffer system. A stationary phase has been chosen to give deltaRm values of the same magnitude as Hansch pi values for a series of phenothiazines. The method can be applied to molecules of a wide range of lipophilicity following preliminary investigations of suitable phase-volume ratios and of the pH and composition of the binary mobile phase, providing adsorption on the support phase is excluded.\n",
      "High-pressure liquid chromatography of drugs. II. An evaluation of a microparticulate cation-exchange column. A microparticulate cation-exchange column has been evaluated for the chromatography of thirty compounds selected as representative of a wide variety of drug substances. Although the column exhibited a strong partition effect besides the expected ion-exchange mechanism, the retention of drugs could be predictably influenced by variation of the eluent ionic strength and organic solvent content. For acidic drugs the column showed little selectivity (although a salting-out effect increased retention at high eluent ionic strengths), but for basic substances Partisil SCX may afford a useful separative medium offering reasonable chromatographic efficiency (HETP is approximately 0.1 mm). The column longevity, however, is at present questionable.\n",
      "Resolution in affinity chromatography. The effect of the heterogeneity of immobilized soybean trypsin inhibitor on the separation of pancreatic proteases. By affinity chromatography, trypsins and chymotrypsins from mouse pancreas homogenates have been separated using soybean trypsin inhibitor immobilized on Sepharose. The effects of the functional heterogeneity of the adsorbent have been investigated in terms of the resolution obtained. Heterogeneity of the adsorbent have been investigated in terms of the resolution obtained. Heterogeneity has been found to originate from the following sources: heterogeneity of the ligand before immobilization; alteration of the ligand by immobilization; and modification of the ligand after immobilization by molecules to be fractionated. Only when the heterogeneity of the adsorbent was minimized could the resolution of closely related enzyme species be achieved. The elution conditions for different enzymes depended on the amount of enzyme applied, as no complete homogeneity could be obtained. In addition, it was found that the adsorbent was partly degraded by the pancreas extract, reducing its fractionating capacity.\n",
      "A thin-layer chromatographic method for the determination of acebutolol and its major metabolite in serum. A sensitive and specific thin-layer chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of acebutolol [DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-n-butyramidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane] and its major metabolite [DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-acetamidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane] is described. A 2-ml volume of serum with 350 ng of quinidine as internal standard was extracted at pH 10, the solvent was evaporated off and the residue was dissolved in 50 mul of methanol. A 10-mul volume of the solution was spotted on a thin-layer plate and after elution (ethyl acetate-methanol-ammonia, 75:20:5) the plate was dried at 90 for 15 min and, after cooling, dipped in a 10% paraffin wax solution. The fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorimeter with a thin-layer scanning attachment. The peak-height ratios of acebutolol to internal standard and metabolite to internal standard were used to quantitate acebutolol and the metabolite, respectively.\n",
      "Influence of L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycine amide on growth hormone secretion in normal and acromegalic subjects. Melanocyte Release-Inhibiting Peptide (MRIP-I) did not affect circulating levels of ACTH, LH, FSH, TSH,ORL, betaMSH and insulin when iv infused (5.0 mg in 5 min plus 0.4 mg/min for 70-115 min), while it significantly reduced serum GH response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and lowered serum GH levels in acromegalics. There was no correlation between the fall in serum GH after MRIP and after dopaminergic drugs in acromegaly. These data are compatible with either a direct suppressive action exerted by MRIP-I at pituitary level or an extra-pituitary effect not involving dopaminergic pathways. It can be spec-lated that since labelled MRIP-I accumualtes in the pineal and melatonin blunts GH response to hypoglycemia, the pineal gland might be involved in the MRIP-I-induced suppression of GH secretion.\n",
      "Use of Counter and rocket immunoelectrophoresis in acute respiratory infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. The use of Counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for the detection of pneumococcal capsular antigen in the sputum and serum of patients suffering from acute respiratory infections is described. The CIE of sputum gave positive results in 224 (99%) out of 225 samples in which Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated by cultural techniques, and in 23 (9%) out of 262 samples in which no or other potential pathogens had been isolated. In the detection of capsular antigen in serum, CIE was positive in 32 (35%) out of 92 pneumonia cases and was associated with an increase in mortality.\n",
      "Requirement for a macromolecular factor for sodium azide activation of guanulate cyclase. Sodium azide, a highly nucleophilic agent and a potent metabolic inhibitor, markedly increased guanylate cyclase activity from supernatant fractions of rat liver homogenates. The effect of sodium azide was not observed with partially purified guanulate cyclase from liver or crude soluble guanylate cyclase from cerebral cortex. However, the effect of sodium azide could be restored by the readdition of a fraction isolated from rat liver homogenates. The macromolecular factor required for the sodium azide effect was separated from soluble guanylate cyclase of rat liver with DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, and some of its properties were examined. The factor was nondialyzable and heat labile.\n",
      "A rapid method for the assay of guanylate cyclase. An extremely rapid and sensitive assay for guanylate cyclase utilizing [alpha-32P]-GTP has been developed. It involves incubation of 5-100 mug of enzyme protein with 1 mM [alpha-32P]-GTP in 40 mM Tris HC1 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3-3 mM MnSO2, 10 mM theophylline and 1 mM cyclic GMP. The reaction is terminated by addition of EDTA, and [32P]-cyclic GMP formed is isolated by sequential chromatography on Dowex-50-H+ and alumina. Recovery of 75-85% of [3H]-cyclic GMP and a blank of 0.001-0.003% of added [32P]-GTP was routinely obtained. The [32P] radioactivity isolated was shown to be cyclic GMP by a variety of techniques. The assay has also been shown to be applicable for a variety of tissues.\n",
      "Lysosomal enzyme secretion from human neutrophils mediated by cyclic CMP: inhibition of cyclic GMP accumulation and neutrophil function by glucocorticosteroids. The effects of several glucocorticosteroids on cyclic GMP accumulation, guanylate cyclase activity, calcium influx, lysosomal enzyme secretion, and phagocytosis were studied in human neutrophils. Contact between neutrophils and serum-treated zymosan particles, in the presence of calcium at pH 7.4, triggered these cellular events within five minutes. Each of these neutrophil functions was markedly inhibited by methylprednisolone sodium succinate, triamcinolone acetonide hemisuccinate and paramethasone acetate but was unaffected by two mineralo-corticosteroids. Human neutrophil soluble guanylate cyclase activity was not changed by the glucocorticoids. Inhibition of phagocytosis by, and lysosomal enzyme secretion from, neutrophils by glucocorticosteroids may be the result of a reduction in cyclic GMP accumulation within these cells. The data suggest that glucocorticosteroids inhibit cyclic GMP accumulation in neutrophils by reducing the influx of extracellular calcium into the cells, thereby limiting the availability of intracellular calcium for metabolic processes associated with the accumulation of cyclic GMP.\n",
      "Cyclic AMP content and regulation of tyrosine-3-mono-oxygenase in rat striatum. The unilateral transection of nigro striatal dopaminergic axons produced a short lasting (15-30 min) increase in the affinity of striatal tyrosine 3-mono-oxygenase (TH), for a synthetic pteridine cofactor (DMPH4). The kinetic changes of striatal TH were paralleled by an increase of striatal cAMP content. Apomorphine (10 mg/kg i.p.) failed to block the activation of TH by cerebral hemisection. Haloperidol (5 mg/kg i.p.) and reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.) also elicited a sudden and similar change in striatal TH activity but this response occurred without an increase in the cAMP content and lasted for longer than 2 hrs. If the hemisection of nigrostriatal pathway was performed after haloperidol or reserpine injection the activation of TH produced by these two drugs was reversed rapidly (about 30 minutes). Pretreatment with haloperidol or reserpine prevented the increase of striatal cAMP following cerebral hemisection. Moreover, haloperidol injected 30 min after cerebral hemisection failed to change the TH kinetic properties in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion but it changed striatal TH in the side contralateral to the lesion. These results suggest that the increase in the affinity of striatal TH for the pteridine cofactor elicited by cerebral hemisection is not related to a lack of stimulation  of DA autoreceptors. Moreover these experiments provide an  evidence that postsynaptic dopamine receptors play a role in the activation of striatal TH elicited by haloperidol.\n",
      "Properties of guanylate cyclase from rat kidney cortex and transplantable kidney tumors. The subcellular distribution and properties of guanylate cyclase was examined in preparations of normal rat renal cortex and Morris renal tumors MK2 and MK3. In normal kidney cortex about two-thirds of guanylate cyclase activity of homogenates was found in soluble fractions. With renal tumors the homogenate activity was less and the enzyme was equally divided between particulate and soluble fractions. The particulate enzyme in kidney cortex and tumors was associated with all particulate fractions. Triton X-100 increased the activity of all preparations. All preparations preferred Mn2+ as the sole cation. The stimulatory effects of Ca2+ on soluble enzyme and inhibitory effects on particulate activity were similar with preparations of renal cortex and tumors. ATP inhibited all preparations. Soluble and particulate guanylate cyclases from renal cortex were activated several-fold with 1 mM NaN3. Preparations of tumor enzymes did not respond to NaN3. Thus, compared to normal renal cortex the subcellular distribution of guanylate cyclase and some of its properties are altered in preparations of renal tumors.\n",
      "Reduction of enamel solubility by sodium monophosphate. The preponderance of evidence indicates that sodium monofluorophosphate exerts a highly beneficial effect on dental caries incidence and enamel solubility. Optimal effects are obtained with a concentration of 4 X 10(3) ppm fluoride, by a four-minute application and by adjusting the pH to 4.0. The reaction of sodium monofluorophosphate with enamel is not temperature dependent. Sodium monofluorophosphate is significantly more protective than sodium fluoride in aqueous solutions at all equivalent fluoride concentrations and in pastes at concentrations exceeding 8 X 10(3) ppm fluoride.\n",
      "Proxemics, locus of control, anxiety, and type of movement in emotionally disturbed and normal boys. In order to determine the interpersonal distancing requirements for emotionally disturbed and normal children and in order to investigate the relationship of locus of control and anxiety to interpersonal space, 20 emotionally disturbed and 20 normal boys were randomly required to approach an object person and to let the object person approach them until they felt uncomfortable. Results indicated that emotionally disturbed boys required more space than normals; that subjects would approach closer than they would allow the object person to approach them; and that externals required more space than internals. There were no significant differences between high and low anxious subjects, nor between emotionally disturbed children diagnostically classified as overanxious reaction and those with other diagnosis. Finally, neither anxiety nor locus of control explained the significant normal-emotionally disturbed differences in space requirements. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed as well as the relationship between the present and previous research.\n",
      "Pharmacotherapy in older depressed patients. Treatment of depression in elderly patients is not generically different from treatment of depression in younger age cohorts. Because of certain age-related physical, physiological, and biochemical factors, however, drug prescription for geriatric patients must be modified in several respects. Tricyclic antidepressants are the principal agents in treatment, but their side effects tend to be magnified in the elderly. Dosage should initially be lower than with younger patients and increased in gradual increments. Lithium, MAO inhibitors, and neuroleptics are appropriate in some cases, but additional precautions are necessary. Because the elderly are liable to multiple system decompensation, they are likely to be prescribed multiple pharmacological agents. Drug-drug interactions involving antidepressant medication present a variety of therapeutic problems and can threaten life. Depression in late life can be treated pharmacologically, but both the therapeutic and deleterious activities of the drugs can be altered by compromised organ systems.\n",
      "The binding of complement by complexes formed between a rabbit antibody and oligosaccharides of increasing size. Immune complexes formed between a homogeneous rabbit antibody to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide and a series of oligosaccharides of varying size derived from it were prepared and tested for their ability to fix guinea pig hemolytic complement. Antibody and either tetra-, hexa-, or octasaccharide formed only monomeric antibody-hapten complexes and did not show any complement binding. A dodecasaccharide and a 16-sugar residues oligomer formed dimer and trimer immune complexes. These complexes were also unable to fix complement. However, as the size of the sugar oligomers was increased to about 21 sugar residues per oligosaccharide molecule or more, the resulting complexes exhibited substantial complement binding, concomitant with the formation of antigen-antibody aggregates higher than trimers. On the other hand, an independent study carried out with the same material suggested changes in the conformation of the Fc moiety in the antibody molecule upon addition of oligosaccharide ligands as small as a 16-residue unit. Since the resulting complexes hardly ehibited any complement binding, ligand-induced conformational changes in the Fc part of the antibody molecule appears to be an insufficient condition per se for triggering complement fixation.\n",
      "Neonatal infection with mouse thymic virus: effects on cells regulating the antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide. Mice infected neonatally with mouse thymic virus (TA) were evaluated at different ages with respect to their ability to give a plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III), as well as the degree of amplifier and suppressor thymus-derived (T) cell activity present. B cell activity matured rapidly from 2 to 4 weeks of age and was not affected by TA infection. Amplifier T cell activity matured progressively over the first 8 weeks of life and was transiently suppressed in TA-infected mice at 4 weeks of age. Suppressor T cell activity measured at 2,4, and 6 weeks of age was unaffected by TA. The findings suggest that TA is highly tropic for T cells and has selective effects on subpopulations of T cells.\n",
      "The chromosomes of four species of the nasuta complex of Drosophila. I. Chromosome maps and inversion polymorphism. The salivary chromosomes of four species of the nasuta complex of Drosophila, D. sulfurigaster albostrigata, D, kohkoa, D. albomicans, and D. kepulauana were studied and chromosome maps of each species are presented; the maps of the latter three species are based on the map of D. sulfurigaster albostrigata. Three of the species D. sulfurigaster albostrigata, D. albomicans, and D. kohkoa were shown to be highly polymorphic for chromosomal inversions while the available evidence indicated that D. kepulauana is much less polymorphic. These facts are correlated with the geographic distribution of the species. Transitional homoselection has not been complete in the evolution of three of the species since D. sulfurigaster albostrigata, D. kohkoa, and D. albomicans have a number of naturally occurring polymorphisms in common.\n",
      "Graft-vs-host reactions in F1 mice induced by parental lymphoid cells: nature of recruited F1 cells. Graft versus host (GVH) reactivity of parental lymph node (LN) cells was assayed by measurements of 3H-thymidine incorporation in vivo. Mitomycin (Mit.) treatment of parental cells abolished their proliferative activity but the combination of such Mit.-treated parental cells with F1 LN cells resulted in much higher proliferation than either one population alone. This recruitment into proliferation of F1 cells was prominent on days 3 and 4 after cell injection and amounted to 35 to 51% of the total activity seen after injection of untreated parental cells alone. The F1 cell sensitive to recruitment was resistant to anti-Thy 1.2 treatment, was not removed by carbonyl iron-magnet separation; and was not present in thymus. The parental cell inducing recruitment was, however, sensitive to anti-Thy 1.2. When spleen cells from hapten immune F1 donors were injected together with Mit.-treated parental LN cells and boosted with hapten on another carrier, a typical \"allogeneic effect\" was observed in the anti-hapten immune response. It was concluded that Mit.-treated parental T cells exerted a mitogenic effect on F1 B cells resulting in extensive recruitment similar to that seen in murine mixed lymphocyte reactions.\n",
      "Determinants of red cell sickling. Effects of varying pH and of increasing intracellular hemoglobin concentration by osmotic shrinkage. The effects of varying pH and of increasing intracellular hemoglobin (Hb) concentration on red cell sickling and oxygen affinity were studied in whole blood from persons with sickle cell anemia (SS) and sickle cell trait (SA). Small increases in SS blood pH inhibited sickling, and small reductions in both SS and SA blood pH promoted sickling far more than accounted for by the Bohr effect. Sickling behavior correlated with minimum gelling concentrations (MGC) of deoxygenated hemolysates without 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. MGC values fell sharply when pH was lowered from 7.25 to 7.15 for HbS and from 7.15 to 6.90 for SA hemolysates, suggesting effects on specific ionic interactions involved in Hb gelation. Possible clinical counterparts are acute metabolic acidosis and alkalosis (prior to change in red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate), where the Bohr effect and oxygen affinity-independent effects of pH alterations on sickling would be additive. Osmotic shrinkage of HbS-containing red cells produced a large fall in oxygen affinity and a marked increase in sickling independent of that fall. The oxygen affinity and sickling properties of SA cells whose MCHC was raised to 40 per cent resembled those of unaltered SS cells, supporting a relationship between molecular aggregation of Hb and low oxygen affinity. Sickling of aerated SS cells in hypertonic saline depended upon partial Hb desaturation due to lowered oxygen affinity. Thus osmotic shrinkage of HbS-containing cells acts synergistically with partial deoxygenation to promote sickling. These conditions are present in the renal medulla, but may occur elsewhere in severe hyperosmolar states.\n",
      "Bacterial interference as a factor in renal infection. These experiments have investigated the role of bacterial interference as a determinant in the epidemiology of renal infection. Two unrelated strains of Escherichia coli, E. coli 08 and 075, isolated from cases of clinical pyelonephritis were used. Although both strains had identical morphology on conventional media they could be differentiated using genetically stable markers for streptomycin resistance and arabinose utilization. When the 2 strains of E. coli were introduced into the kidney simultaneously by direct inoculation mixed infections were readily established. On the other hand, although both strains of E. coli were equally invasive as individual pathogens, pyelonephritis, when induced using a retrograde challenge with a mixed culture of the same organisms was almost invariably caused by the 08 strain alone. Further experiments showed that bacterial interference occurred within the kidney and determined the pattern of infection. When unilateral renal infections were established with E. coli 08 and the animals subsequently challenged with E. coli 075, it was found that E. coli 075 infection never occurred in kidneys infected with E. coli 08 but infection was established in the contralateral kidney. The experiments have shown that mixed renal infection with E. coli are uncommon even when both pathogens are equally nephropathogenic and are introduced simultaneously into the bladder.\n",
      "The effect of the plasma bicarbonate level on proximal tubule sodium reabsorption in NH4Cl-loaded dogs. In an attempt to examine the effects of mild and severe chronic metabolic acidosis on proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, 6 dogs were given 10 mEq. per kilogram per day and 5 dogs were given 20mEq. per kilogram per day of ammonium chloride for 3 days and compared to 12 normal dogs during a steady-state water diuresis and following the administration of ethacrynic acid (EA) intravenously (2 mg. per kilogram) utilizing standard clearance methodology, In the severely acidotic group (pH decrease is greater tthan 0.2) plasma pH was 7.08 +/- 0.06 and plasma bicarbonate was 6.3 +/- 1.0 Eq. per liter compared to a pH of 7.33 +/-0.02 and bicarbonate of 13.4 +/- 0.7 in mild acidosis (pH decrease is less than 0.2). During a steady-state water diuresis urine flow was 14.2 +/- 0.9 in severely acidotic compared to 10.5 +/-0.7 ml. per minute per 100 ml. glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in normal dogs (p is less than 0.01). Following EA sodium clearance increased 38.4 +/- 3.5 in severely acidotic dogs and 27.6 +/- 2.0 ml. per minute per 100 ml. GFR in normal dogs (p is less than 0.02). In mild acidosis, steady-state fractional urine flow and the increase in fractional sodium clearance following EA were not significantly different than normal dogs. We conclude that chronic metabolic acidosis leads to an increase in distal solute load and enhanced natriuretic effect of EA secondary to a decrease in proximal tubule sodium reabsorption which may be dependent upon the degree of reduction in the plasma bicarbonate level.\n",

Lethal midline granuloma is a non-specific clinical term used for different pathological entities often exhibiting some semblance to each other as they lie along a histological spectrum. Nevertheless, each entity has a specific diagnostic pattern. The histological picture with distinguishing features of each specific type is pointed out. Stress is made on the use of repeated biopsy until the specific histological diagnosis can be made so that specific treatment as breifly outlined, can be carried out to insure the best prognosis.\n",
      "Ganglioside biosynthesis. Characterization of uridine diphosphate galactose: GM2 galactosyltransferase in golgi apparatus from rat liver. An enzyme that transfers galactose from UDP-Gal to ganglioside GM2 (Tay-Sachs ganglioside) was concentrated 50 times in Golgi apparatus from rat liver relative to total homogenates. This enzyme required detergents or phospholipids as dispersing agents. Of the numerous detergents tested, sodium taurocholate and Triton CF-54 were most effective in stimulating the reaction. Cardiolipin alone was more effective than any of the detergents tested in stimulating enzyme activity. The pH optimum for the reaction varied with the nature of the dispersing agent. With sodium taurocholate, Triton CF-54 and cardiolipin, the pH optima were 6.2, 5.9, and 5.6, respectively. The enzyme had a nearly absolute requirement for Mn2+, with maximum activity being attained at a concentration of 15 mM Mn2+. Other divalent or trivalent cations were either less effective than Mn2+ or inhibited the transferase reaction. The Km values calculated for UDP-Gal and GM2 were 1.1 X 10(-4) M and 9.9 X 10(-5) M, respectively. The enzyme could not be dissociated from Golgi apparatus fractions by treatment with ultrasound, indicating that it is tightly associated with the membrane and not part of the luminal contents. The newly synthesized GM2, the product of the reaction, was incorporated into or became tightly associated with the membranes of the Golgi apparatus.\n",
      "Effect on various putative neurotransmitters on the secretion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the rat hypothalamus in vitro-a model of the neurotransmitters involved. The effect of incubating the hypothalamus of adult male rats with various neurotransmitters upon the release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was studied. The CRH activity in the incubation medium was assayed in 48 h median eminence-lesioned rats and the corticosteroidogenesis of excised adrenals in vitro was used as the end-point. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (100 pg/ml-10ng/ml) caused a dose-dependent release of CRH which was antagonized by methysergide (30-100 ng/ml). The response to 5-hydroxytryptamine was also inhibited by hexamethonium and atropine which indicated that it was acting through a cholinergic interneurone. Melatonin (10 ng) did not alter the basal release of CRH but inhibited the action of both 5-hydroxytryptamine (10 ng) and acetylcholine (3 pg). Thus it appears that both 5-hydroxytryptamine and melatonin play a role in the control of CRH release. Noradrenaline blocked the release of CRH induced by both acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine and presumably this inhibition was caused by direct action on the CRH neurone. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) also inhibited the release of CRH and may also be involved in the regulation of CRH secretion. The inhibitory neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, GABA and melatonin, act via independent receptor mechanisms. A model based on the above data is presented.\n",
      "Purification of canine prolactin by preparative isotachophoresis. Preparative isotachophoresis in polyacrylamide gel using carrier ampholytes as 'spacers' has been used to purify prolactin from canine pituitary extracts. Using Ampholine pH 5-8 as spacers, a prolactin fraction was obtained which was essentially homogeneous as judged by the criteria of disc electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Amino acid analysis indicated a close similarity between canine and ovine prolactin. A growth hormone fraction, identified by its electrophoretic mobility, was also obtained although this was heterogeneous in disc electrophoresis at alkaline pH.\n",
      "Acid-base balance in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) subjected to acid stresses. 1. The respiratory properties of rainbow-trout blood were investigated in acid-stressed fish. In the first group acid was introduced into the bloodstream and in the second the carbon dioxide content of the ambient water was increased. 2. Initially the introduction of acid to the blood caused a decrease in blood pH and bicarbonate, and increases in oxygen uptake and ventilation volume. After 2-3 h these values had returned to the control levels. 3. Trout subjected to high ambient CO2 (about 10 mmHg) showed a decrease in blood pH while PCO2 and bicarbonate increased. After 8 h the trout began to show signs of compensation to the acidosis. 4. In each experiment the blood PO2 was little changed but blood O2 content was decreased and tended not to resume the control value even after several hours. 5. The results are discussed in terms of the various acid-base mechanisms thought to be available to the fish. These include branchial ion exchanges and the possible buffering roles of the extracellular and intracellular fluids.\n",
      "Connexions between hair-plate afferents and motoneurones in the cockroach leg. 1. The trochanteral hair-plate afferents in the metathoracic leg of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, were stimulated electrically and at the same time intracellular recordings were made from either motoneurones, interneurones or afferent terminals within the methathoracic ganglion. 2. Activity in the hair-plate afferents evoked short latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in femur flexor motoneurones. The latency of the IPSPs was on average 1-8 ms longer than the latency ofthe EPSPs. 3. Intracellular recordings from terminal branches of the hair-plate afferents showed that the delay between the peak of the afferent terminal spike and the beginning of the EPSPs is about 0.4 ms. This finding, together with the observations that the amplitude of the EPSPs is increased by the passage of hyperpolarizing current and decreased following high-frequency stimulation, indicates that the EPpSPs are evoked via-monosynaptic chemical synaptic junctions. 4. The observations of the long latency of the IPSPs, the need for a number of afferents to be simultaneously acive for them to be evoked and the occasional variability in latency, all indicate that the IPSPs are evoked via a disynaptic pathway...\n",
      "Physiological properties of eel haemoglobin: hypoxic acclimation, phosphate effects and multiplicity. Unlike the whole body oxygen affinity, which adapts readily to environmental oxygen tensions, haemoglobins, prepared from normoxic- and hypoxic-accimated eels (Anguilla anguilla) show no adaptive changes in oxygenation properties or in multiplicity. Hypoxic acclimation is, howeveer, accompanied by a strong decrease in red cell nucleoside triphosphates, particularly guanosine triphospphate (GTP), which depresses oxygen affinity of the composite and component haemoglobins more strongly than does the concurring ATP. The effects of pH, temperature and salts on the oxygenation properties of the (isolated) haemoglobins are reported, discussed in relation to the varying environmetal conditions encountered by eels, and compared with data on American and Japanese eels (A. rostrata and A. juponica, respectively.\n",
      "[LP-X in newborns: increased incidence of positive tests without cholestasis (author's transl)]. The investigation of 194 newborns has shown that during the first weeks of life the abnormal lipoprotein-X (LP-X) was present in the serum of nearly 50% of the infants, with no clinical chemical evidence of cholestasis. The percentage of LP-X positive tests was even higher in the group of immature newborns (65%). There was no correlation between the bilirubin concentration and the detection of LP-X. The activities of leucine arylamidase (EC 3.4.1.1) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2) as well as the concentrations of total and free cholesterol did not differ in the LP-X positive and negative infants. Except in one case, LP-X was never detectable on the first day of life. The earliest date of appearance was the second day. In the serum of some infants, who were LP-X positive shortly after birth, the lipoprotein could still be found at the age of 2--3 months. The incidence of LP-X was not higher in newborns with blood group incompatibility than in newborns with unspecific hyperbilirubinaemia. After exchange transfusions LP-X disappeared in most cases, but it could later often be detected again. In some newborns, who were LP-X negative a few days after birth LP-X was first detected at the age of 2-3 months. The LP-X test is of no use for th diagnosis of cholestasis in newborn infants. The test is specific for cholestasis only after the first year of life. The increased incidence of positive LP-X tests in newborns is discussed as a consequence of immature liver function.\n",
      "Neurotrophic activity of brain extracts in forelimb regeneration of the urodele, Triturus. The loss in protein synthesis which the regenerating forelimb of the newt suffers after denervation can be recovered by infusing into it an extract of newt soluble brain protein. Moreover, the synthesis of basic protein shows a greater response to the active brain principle than does that of acidic protein. The active agent of the nervous tissue is destroyed by heat and trypsin digestion. Extracts of liver and spleen, similarly prepared, do not evoke recovery of lost protein synthesis. Synaptosomal extracts of the frog brain also cause recovery of protein synthesis in the denervated regenerate, demonstrating the likelihood that the active agent is not species-specific within these amphibians, that it is a constituent of the neuronal fraction of nervous tissue, and that it is present in axonal terminals. Additional experiments showed that the nervous agent is likely a basic protein, and that the amount of protein infused is of the order of only 1.0% of the total regenerate protein. The significance of the findings is discussed in relation to the nature of the effect on protein synthesis and the nature of the active principle.\n",
      "Interaction between phloretin and the red blood cell membrane. Phloretin binding to red blood cell components has been characterized at pH6, where binding and inhibitory potency are maximal. Binding to intact red cells and to purified hemoglobin are nonsaturated processes approximately equal in magnitude, which strongly suggests that most of the red cell binding may be ascribed to hemoglobin. This conclusion is supported by the fact that homoglobin-free red cell ghosts can bind only 10% as much phloretin as an equivalent number of red cells. The permeability of the red cell membrane to phloretin has been determined by a direct measurement at the time-course of the phloretin uptake. At a 2% hematocrit, the half time for phloretin uptake is 8.7s, corresponding to a permeability coefficient of 2 x 10(-4) cm/s. The concentration dependence of the binding to ghosts reveals two saturable components. Phloretin binds with high affinity (K diss = 1.5 muM) to about 2.5 x 10(6) sites per cell; it also binds with lower affinity (Kdiss = 54 muM) to a second (5.5 x 10(7) per cell) set of sites. In sonicated total lipid extracts of red cell ghosts, phloretin binding consists of a single, saturable component. Its affinity and total number of sites are not significantly different from those of the low affinity binding process in ghosts. No high affinity binding of phloretin is exhibited by the red cell lipid extracts. Therefore, the high affinity phloretin binding sites are related to membrane proteins, and the low affinity sites result from phloretin binding to lipid. The identification of these two types of binding sites allows phloretin effects on protein-mediated transport processes to be distinguished from effects on the lipid region of the membrane.\n",
      "Effect of synthetic substance P on monoaminergic mechanisms in brain. Synthetic substance P has been discovered to stimulate significantly the formation of dopa in the limbic, striatum, hemisphere and diencephalon regions of the brain and the lower brain stem. There was no effect upon 5-hydroxytryptophan formation or on tryptophan or tyrosine levels. After inhibition of monoamine synthesis by N'-(DL-SERYL)-N2-(2, 3, 4-trihydroxybenzyl)hydrazine, substance P significantly accelerated the disappearance of dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Substance P appears to stimulate monoaminergic neurons in the brain and to serve as an excitatory transmitter in nerve terminals impinging upon dopaminergic cell bodies. A similar stimulation of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine indicate a similar transmitter role for noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. These data strengthen questions about the possible clinical influence of substance P in disease states involving monoaminergic mechanisms including Parkinsonism and schizophrenia.\n",

      "Occurrence of a trypsin inhibitor in eggplant exocarps. A trypsin inhibitor was extracted from eggplant exocarps with several buffers. The 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 5.5. extract had the highest specific activity. The crude inhibitor, obtained by heat treatment and salting-out from the acetate buffer extract, contained 4.5% nitrogen and 22.6% hexose. Isoelectrofocusing demonstrated that this crude inhibitor in the eggplant exocarps was composed of at least three  forms, one of which differed in its isoelectric point. The form at pH 4.7 had the strongest activity. The molecular weights of these inhibitors were estimated to be between 5,000-10,000 by gel filtration.\n",

This report describes a 4-mth-old infant with polyarteritis nodosa who had a rapidly fatal course with the diagnosis ultimately being made at necropsy. The pathological lesions consisted of diffuse arterial disease with severe coronary involvement, and additional unusual features included a ruptured coronary artery aneurysm and a valvulitis of the mitral and aortic valves similar to that seen in rheumatic fever. The aetiology of polyarteritis is briefly summarised and the possibility of an immune reaction to foreign antigens, such as drugs or viruses, is considered.\n",

      "Maternal and fetal plasma levels of free corticosteroids in pathological deliveries. Does intrauterine acidosis induce increased steroid secretion? The concentration of free steroids (CS) increases in both fetal and maternal plasma during labor and delivery. Fetal levels are higher after vaginal than after cesarean section. These differences may indicate an important role of the fetal adrenal gland in the induction of labor or they may reflect merely the fetal response to the stress of delivery. During incrased intrauterine stress steroid secretion is increased as shown here. We examined 41 mothers and their infants during pathological labor. Pathology was assessed from fetal acidosis and/or a clinically obstetric disease of the mother or fetus. The 41 cases included 9 cesarean sections, 8 forceps deliveries; 24 spontaneous deliveries of which 7 were premature. At the time of delivery the pH and CS level were determined in maternal and umbilical vessels in all cases. During spontaneous labor blood samples were also taken during the different stages of labour. A competetive protein binding assay with transcortin without fractionation of the steroids was used. Progesteron was determined by the same assay. The level of this hormone, however, remains unchanged and hence any changes reflect changes in CS. The levels of CS were correlated with the pH values and compared to previously obtained normal values. During pathological deliveries CS levels in both mother and fetus are normal as long as there is no acidosis (Fig. 1). If acidosis is present the CS level in the umbilical artery is usually higher than normal. In 13 out of 18 vaginal deliveries the CS level was above normal, in the other 5 at the upper limit of normal (Fig. 1 and 2). At the same time the a--v difference becomes smaller and sometimes even negative. No changes were noted in maternal and umbilical venous blood (Tab. I and II). Similar dependence on the pH was found for cesarean sections (Tab. III). In premature deliveries without acidosis in the umbilical artery the CS levels were lower in both mother and fetus (Tab. I). These results indicate that the fetal adrenal gland reacts to acidosis, i.e., intrauterine stress, with increased corticosteroid secretion. This rise depends on the pH of fetal blood and not on the type of delivery (Fig. 3).\n",
      "Gastric acid inactivation of erythromycin stearate in solid dosage forms. The effect of hydrochloric acid at pH 1.2-3.2 ON ERYTHROMYCIN STEARATE AND COMMERCIAL DOSAGE FORMS OF ERYTHROMYCIN STEARATE WAS STUDIED. Under all conditions examined, erythromycin was readily dissolved from the stearate as hydrochloride, and rapidly lost its biological activity in solution. The inclusion of pepsin in the test systems did not affect the results. Although formulation differences somewhat affected the rate of destruction, acid lability was exhibited by all products examined, except enteric-coated tablets. Amounts of acid considered to be normal in the fasting stomach contents of adults during the time likely for a dose to remain in the stomach caused 70-90% destruction within 15 min after the shells started to rupture. Amounts of hydrochloric acid appreciably less than 1 mEq, representing abnormally small quantities even in the fasting state, caused destruction ranging from 30 to 70% of the doses in 15 min. These results are not reconcilable with published statements that the sensitivity of erythromycin to gastric acid is overcome by providing the antibiotic in the form of stearate salt.\n",
      "Synthesis and alpha-adrenolytic activity of chiral beta-haloethylamines. Several series of N,N-diaralkyl- and N-aryloxyalkyl-N-aralkyl-beta-haloethylamines were synthesized containing centers of chirality in the aralkyl substituent and in the beta-haloethyl moiety to study the stereoselectivity of alpha-adrenolytic activity of the beta-haloethylamines. These compounds were synthesized from starting materials of known absolute configuration via synthetic schemes that did not alter the stereochemical integrity of the chiral centers. Evaluation of the alpha-adrenolytic activities of these beta-haloethylamines on rat vas deferens indicated a variable degree of stereoselectivity of adrenergic blockade, which is interpreted in terms of drug-receptor interactions.\n",

      "Use of 300-msec microwave irradiation for enzyme inactivation: a study of effects of sodium pentobarbital on acetylcholine concentration in mouse brain regions. Microwave irradiation of 6 kw at 2450 MHz for 300 msec was sufficient to completely inactivate mouse brain cholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase. After this method of sacrifice, the acetylcholine contents of mouse brain regions, given in nanomoles per gram, were found to be: striatum, 81; medulla-pons, 44; diencephalon-midbrain, 34; hippocampus, 31; cerebral cortex, 26; and cerebellum, 17. Sodium pentobarbital caused a dose-dependent increase in whole brain acetylcholine. A maximal increase of 81% in whole brain was seen at 15 minutes with 80 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital. The increase in acetylcholine after sodium pentobarbital treatment was not caused by anoxia from respiratory depression or by hypothermia. All brain regions except the cerebellum exhibited an increase in acetylcholine after pentobarbital treatment. Fifteen minutes after treatment, cerebellar acetylcholine was significantly decreased. However, at the time when half of the animals had regained the righting reflex, the unconscious mice showed an increase in cerebellar acetylcholine which was statistically significant  as compared to control. The relative accumulation rate of acetylcholine calculated for cerebral cortex and hippocampus was higher than that for striatum although the absolute rate of accumulation of ACh was higher in the striatum. Thus, after sodium pentobarbital treatment, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus exhibit a greater cholinergic response than the striatum.\n",
      "A test for antinociceptive activity of narcotic and narcotic antagonist analgesics in the guinea pig. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as a nociceptive stimulus intradermally in the guinea pig. The responses evoked by EDTA included vocalization, biting and scratching at the site of injection and escape behavior. Nociception by EDTA was shown to be the result of its cation chelating activity. The suppression of EDTA-induced responses proved to be a rapid and effective antinociceptive test. The narcotic analgesics morphine, codeine, meperidine and methadone and the narcotic antagonist analgesics cyclazocine, cyclorphan, nalorphine and pentazocine were active. The slopes of the dose-response curves of the narcotic antagonist analgesics were significantly shallower than those of the narcotic analgesics. The test was highly specific for these analgesics. Antipyretic analgesics and various nonanalgesic drugs were inactive.\n",
      "Pharmacological characterization of adrenergic receptors of a rabbit cerebral artery in vitro. In the light of controversy over the functional significance of the abundant sympathetic innervation of large cerebral blood vessels, an in vitro analysis of the adrenergic receptors mediating contractile effects in the rabbit basilar artery was undertaken. Beta adrenergic stimulation had no effect, and agents that block norepinephrine (NE) uptake did not alter contractile responses to l-NE. The l-NE dose-response curve could be resolved into two components S-shaped curves: the first had an ED50 OF 10(-5) M and reached a plateau at 10(-4) M; the second component continued above 10(-3) M without reaching a plateau. Phenylephrine and epinephrine dose-response curves were also biphasic; d-NE responses corresponded to the second phase of the l-NE curve. Relative potencies for the two components were different. For the first component, these were 1:0.23:0.18:0.03 for l-NE, epinephrine, phenylephrine and d-NE, respectively; relative potencies for the second component of the curve were 1:1:0.11:0.23. Phentolamine dissociation constants were analyzed separately for each component. The value for low l-NE concentrations was 5 X 10 (-8) M and, for higher concentrations, it was 3 X 10(-6) . The insensitivity of the alpha adrenergic receptor and the poor responsiveness of the muscle to its activation with agonist concentrations below 10(-4) M can probably account for the small contractile responses to nerve stimulation of large pial arteries in spite of their abundant innervation.\n",
      "Cation-binding property of choroid plexus peptide IIF. Preparations of the melanotropic-lipolytic peptide IIF from bovine choroid plexus contain 3% Ca, 1% Mg and less than 0.1% Na and K. Ca and Mg were removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-10 in 1 N acetic acid. Capacity of the resulting cation-free peptide to bind Ca++, Mg++, Na+ and K+ was examined with the method of Hummel and Dreyer (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 63: 530-532, 1962). Peptide IIF bound a maximum of 3.7 to 4.4 mEq of Ca++, Mg++, Na+ or K+ per g of peptide. For each cation, linear Scatchard plot indicated one class of binding site. Association constants (liters per mole) were Ca++, 4.3 X 10(4); Mg++, 3.6 X 10(4); Na+, 4.8 X 10(2), K+, 1.9 X 10(2). Competitive binding experiments showed that all four cations occupied the same class of binding site.\n",
      "A study of the mechanism of transport of diphenylhydantoin in the rat submaxillary gland in vitro. In vitro studies performed on rat submaxillary gland slices with diphenylhydantoin (6 X 10(-6) M) showed that variations of extracellular pH (pHe) had no significant effects on uptake and only slight effects on efflux (lowering the pHe slightly decreased efflux rates, whereas increasing pHe slightly increased efflux rates). Increasing diphenylhydantoin concentration significantly decreased uptake and slightly increased the rate of efflux. Uptake of 14C-diphenylhydantoin was significantly decreased when compared to control conditions (pH 7.40, 37 degrees C, 100% O2 aeration, 6 X 10(-6) M) by the following alterations: aeration of the incubation medium with N2 instead of O2, decrease of bath temperature from 37 degrees C to 5 degrees C and addition of the following metabolic inhibitors: iodoacetic acid (10(-3)M), 2,4-dinitrophenol (10(-3)M) and cyanide (10(-3)M). Probenecid (10(-3)M) had no significant effect on diphenylhydantoin uptake when compared to control values. No evidence of salivary biotransformation of diphenylhydantoin was seen in the in vitro system using thin-layer chromatography. These in vitro data suggest an active transport process that is concentration-dependent with a possible saturable binding site on the membrane or in the interior of the cell.\n",
      "Aminopyridines and sparteine as inhibitors of membrane potassium conductance: effects on Myxicola giant axons and the lobster neuromuscular junction. The effects of the compounds 2-, 3- and 4-aminopyridine and sparteine on membrane conductance changes were examined using both voltage-clamped Myxicola axons and the lobster neuromuscular junction. In Myxicola axons, the aminopyridines very specifically inhibited the potassium conductance when applied at concentrations of 0.1 mM to 5 mM without any apparent effect of resting membrane potential. Concentrations in excess of 5 mM were needed to inhibit noticeably the sodium conductance. Potassium conductance-voltage curves were shifted in the depolarized direction along the voltage axis with no significant change in shape. There were only minor changes in the kinetics of potassium activation. In high potassium solutions, both inward and outward potassium currents were equally sensitive to the aminopyridines. Sparteine was, in general, found to be a more potent, but somewhat less specific, inhibitor of the potassium conductance. In contrast to the aminopyridines, sparteine was more effective when applied at basic pH and in addition tended to produce a noticeable degree of potassium inactivation. When applied to the lobster neuromuscular junction, 2-aminopyridine and sparteine dramatically increased the amplitude of both excitatory and inhibitory postjunctional potentials, with little or no change in resting potential, resting input conductance, reversal potential, or miniature end plate potential amplitude or frequency. Quantal content per fiber was increased by approximately a factor of 3 for the excitatory responses.\n",
      "Effects of calcium on the local anesthetic suppression of ionic conductances in squid axon membranes. The effects of varying the external calcium concentration on the suppression of membrane ionic conductances by procaine and benzocaine have been examined under voltage-clamped conditions. The suppression of peak conductance and steady-state conductance by procaine or benzocaine applied externally or internally was not affected by changing the external calcium concentration between 10 and 100 mM. When the calcium concentration was lowered below 10 mM (5 or 2 mM), the procaine effect was slightly potentiated. This augmentation could not be ascribed to an acceleration in the rate of penetration of procaine into the axon in low calcium solutions. The resting membrane conductance was slightly decreased by procaine in a manner independent of the external calcium concentration. The maximum effect of procaine on resting conductances was obtained at a concentration much lower than that required for maximum suppression of peak and steady-state conductances. The present results are not compatible with the hypothesis that calcium competes with local anesthetics for a negatively charged site on the membrane. It is suggested that hydrophobic interactions of local anesthetic molecules with the membrane affect the resting membrane conductance whereas coulombic interactions are responsible for the conductance changes observed during nerve activity.\n",
      "Twitch potentiation of skeletal muscle by physostigmine at different pH. This report extends earlier research, done with external media at pH 7.2, to new studies at pH 6.4 and 8.4 as well as 7.2, to determine the roles of the protonated and neutral forms of physostigmine (a weak base with pKalpha = 8.2) in causing twitch potentiation of the frog sartorius muscle. Physostigmine, especially at relatively high pH (8.4) and concentration (1.5 mM), considerably blocks excitation. However, the results show in general that physostigmine potentiation increased peak contraction time and thereby indicate that potentiation is occurring in terms of prolongation of the active state. At pH 6.4 and 8.4, 1 mM physostigmine causes no change in the mechanical threshold of K depolarization contractures of toe muscles, as found previously at pH 7.2. Physostigmine increasingly prolongs the action potential as pH rises, i.e., in positive correlation with the twitch potentiation, thus indicating that this electrical change is the prime determinant of the potentiation.\n",
      "The renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate of anaesthetized dogs during acute changes in plasma sodium concentration. 1. The effects of acute changes in plasma Na concentration (P(Na)) on renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were studied in anaesthetized greyhounds. Saline was infused at a constant rate (0.1 ml. kg(-1) min(-1)) either into a renal artery or into a systemic vein. Plasma Na concentration was altered by varying the Na concentration of the infused saline from 0.154 to 0.077, 0.616 or 1.232 M.2. Blood pressure (B.P.), packed cell volume (PCV), concentration of plasma solids (PS) and the plasma concentration of H(+) and K (P(K)) ions were measured but no attempt was made to contain their fluctuation.3. An infusion of hypertonic saline into a renal artery usually led to an ipsilateral increase in RBF for 5-15 min, followed by a progressive fall. Over-all, mean values of RBF fell with P(Na) throughout the range studied (120-190 m-mole l.(-1)). Glomerular filtration rate rose with P(Na) to reach maximal values at P(Na) levels of 140-160 m-mole l.(-1), but fell thereafter. The combined fall in RBF and GFR, without change in filtration fraction, at P(Na) values above 160 m-mole l.(-1) is consistent with an alteration in afferent arteriolar resistance. The fall in GFR despite a rise in RBF noted when P(Na) was reduced below 140 m-mole l.(-1) requires an additional explanation.4. Renal blood flow was independent of P(K); it was inversely related to [H(+)] and directly related to PS. Glomerular filtration rate was independent of PCV and P(K). It was also inversely related to [H(+)] and directly related to PS up to a value of 6 g 100 g(-1) plasma, after which the relationship was reversed. These results suggest that the renal vascular responses to acute changes in P(Na) may be mediated in part, at least, by concurrent change in PS and [H(+)].\n",

Optimal assay conditions are described for 8 hydrolases of Euglena gracilis var. bacillaris, SM-L1 (streptomycin-bleached) strain, 7 of which have an acid pH-optimum. Acid-phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, b-fucosidase, cathepsin D, RNase, DNase, and an esterase are active in cell homogenates.

      "Adrenergic sulfonanilides. 4. Centrally active beta-adrenergic agonists. The central nervous system (CNS) activities of a number of soterenol analogs have been investigated, and several of these compounds possessed potent morphine antagonistic and anorexiant properties. The CNS activity of these compounds was enhanced by certain lipophilic [e.g., 1,1-dimethyl-2-phenethyl (43) or cyclopropyl (40 and 44)] nitrogen substituents; however, minor structural changes on either the aromatic or side-chain moieties drastically reduced central activity. Toxicity in this series was related to the inherent alpha-adrenergic stimulating component (direct or indirect).\n",

Ontogenetic development of NADH-dependent methemoglobin reductase was followed in humans and rats. The human kinetic profile differs from that in the rat. The low level of methemoglobin reductase in human infants at birth and for the first months of life may provide a partial explanation of the particular susceptibility to methemoglobinemic agents of this age group.\n",
      "Biotransformation, sex hormones, and toxicity of two volatile anesthetics in mice. Male and female DBA 11 mice recovered from 1 hr of anesthesia with chloroform of fluoroxene apparently unharmed. However, many of the animals died within 24-48 hr after anesthesia. Pretreatment with phenobarbital increased, while pretreatment with a small dose of carbon tetrachloride decreased, this toxicity. Relatively more males than females died. Pretreatment with estradiol in males and testosterone in females reversed this ratio. We conclude that the murine toxicity of chloroform and fluoxene is dependent on biotransformation by hepatic microsomal enzymes and that the testosterone enhances postanesthetic toxicity of these agents.\n",
      "Neuronal control of neurotransmitters biosynthesis during development. Studies on neuronal control mechanisms of neurotransmitters biosynthesis during the development of peripheral and central autonomic synapses are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on investigations of developing peripheral sympathetic ganglia and brain in chick embryo and chick. Studies on the development of autonomic neurons and synapses under different pharmacological conditions are reported. Principally the effect of a) the administration of drugs and precursors such as L-dopa, 3H-dopa, 6-OH dopa; b) the prenatal administration of reserpine; c) the blockade of cholinergic receptors; d) the nerve growth factor (NGF) is analyzed.

      "Isolation and properties of the replicase of encephalomyocarditis virus. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase) of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus was found to be closely associated with the smooth membranes of infected BHK-21 cells. An RNA-dependent EMC replicase was extracted from the membranes with 0.15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 1,1,2-trichlorotri-fluoroethane (Genetron 113) and further purified by high-salt dextran-polyethylene glycol phase separation, sievorptive chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The enzyme does not manifest strict specificity toward EMC RNA template. It can use also Qbeta RNA, rRNA of BHK cells, or poly(C). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified EMC replicase labeled with radioactive methionine revealed that, of all the stable EMC proteins, the enzyme contains predominantly the 56,000-dalton (E) polypeptide.\n",
      "Comparative properties of bacteriophage phi6 and phi6 nucleocapsid. Nonionic detergent treatments released a nucleocapsid from the enveloped bacteriphage phi6. The nucleocapsid sedimented at nearly the same rate as the whole phage in sucrose density gradients, but the buoyant density in Cs2S04 changed from 1.22 g/cm3 for the whole phage to 1.33 g/cm3 for the nucleocapsid. The detergent completely removed the lipid and 5 of the 10 proteins from the phage. Surface labeling of the phage and nucleocapsid with 125I revealed that protein P3 was on the outer surface of the whole phage and P8 was on the surface of the nucleocapsid. Both the phage and the nucleocapsid were stable between pH 6.0 and 9.5. Low concentrations of EDTA (10-4 M) dissociated the nucleocapsid but had no effect on the whole phage. The nucleocapsid contained all three double-stranded RNA segments, as well as RNA polymerase activity.\n",

      "[Effects of pH on the processes of excitation-contraction coupling of bullfrog atrium (author's transl)]. It has long been demonstrated that in cardiac muscle alterations in the extracellular pH exhibit a remarkable inotropic effect, whereas the precise mechanism is not fully clarified yet in spite of many associated thories. In recent years, however, abundant informations about the processes of excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling) of cardiac muscle have been obtained. Accordingly, the mechanisms of inotropic actions of pH on cardiac muscles must also be re-examined on the basis of these lately developed theories of E-C coupling. In the present experiment, therefore, we attempted to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of actions of pH upon several processes of E-C coupling using the bullfrog atrium whose processes of E-C coupling have been fairly well known...\n",
      "[Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials]. We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.\n",
      "Effects of changing levels of glucocorticosteroids on heat exposure in rabbit. Rabbits exposed for one hour to a temperature of 40degrees Cand 35-37% humidity showed elevated plasma osmolality and pH. Most of the animals were not able to withstand the heat. Dexamethasone-treated rabbits under the same conditions withstood the heat better and their plasma pH and osmolality remained constant. Metopirone-treated rabbits withstood the heat and showed a rise in plasma osmolality and a slight change in plasma pH. The highest rise in rectal temperature was observed in the metopirone-treated rabbits. Only the untreated animals were unable to regain pre-exposure rectal temperature. The results suggest that high levels of glucocorticosteroids enhance neurogenic and metabolic mechanisms which have protective functions during acute exposure to heat.\n",
      "Changes in contractility and calcium binding of guinea pig taenia coli by treatment with enzymes which hydrolyze sialic acid. The effects of neuraminidase and phospholipase C on the contractility and the Ca++ -binding of guinea pig taenia coli were investigated. Potassium contracture or histamine-induced contracture of taenia coli was inhibited by treatment with neuraminidase, though acetylcholine-induced contracture was not. Treatment with phospholipase C markedly inhibited the contracture induced by isotonic potassium, histamine or acetylcholine. By treatment with neuraminidase for 4 hr, about 40 mumol/100 mg wer wt of sialic acid was released from taenia coli. This corresponded to two-fifths of total content of sialic acid. By treatment with phospholipase C for 2 hr, a similar amount of sialic acid to that produced  by neuraminidase treatment was released. The Scarchard plot of Ca++-binding was a biphasic pattern indicating the presence of two types ofthe Ca++ -binding site with different affinity constants. Neuraminidase produced a 57% decrease in the amount of bound Ca++. The Scatchard plot of Ca++ -binding changed to a monophasic pattern indicating the disapperance of thel ow affinity Ca++ -binding site. Phospholipase C caused a 59% decrease of bound Ca++. The Scatchard plot also indicated the disappearance of the low affinity Ca++ -binding site. From these results, we speculated that sialicacid residue of surface membrane of the muscle cell was first site in the Ca++ -influx mechanism.\n",
      "[Treatment of acute respiratory insufficiency in cardiac surgery]. An analysis of the main causes of acute respiratory insufficiency as a frequently observed and severe complication of the early postoperative period after open-heart surgery is presented. To permit differentiated employment of respiratory resuscitation measures, subcompensated and decompensated forms of acute postoperative respiratory insufficiency were distinguished on the basis of clinical and laboratory data. The most efficient methods of treatment of this complication are described, including the employment of helium, ultrasonic inhalator, therapeutic intubation, bronchoscopy, long-term automated artificial pulmonary ventilation. A combined employment of the modified methods of respiratory resuscitation permitted to improve the course of acute respiratory insufficiency and to reduce the mortality nearly three-fold.\n",
      "[Isoenzyme differentiation of gamma-glutamyltransferase by concanavalin A and Con- A-Sepharose (author's transl)]. In this investigation a new possibility of isoenzyme-differentiation of the gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) (EC Nr.2.3.2.2.) was demonstrated by Concanavalin A and Con A-Sepharose. Because of the different sugar content of the glycoproteins distinction between liver- and kidney-GGT is possible. Furthermore it was possible for the first time to show a different precipitation behaviour of one glycoprotein to Concanavalin A in certain diseases. In cases of alcoholic hepatitis GGT looses its Concanavalin A-affinity because of increased neuraminic acid concentration. The possible reasons of the different behaviour to the binding affinity of Con A and Con A-Sepharose and GGT as well as additional use for enzyme-differentiation by Con A-Sepharose affinity chromatography are discussed.\n",

The significance of rich microflora present in the conventional forestomach is not known, although in this function between man and ruminants were discussed.\n",
      "Removal of basement membrane in the involuting breast. Morphologic and immunohistochemical studies by light and electron microscopy indicated that basement membrane was removed during the process of involution of the murine breast. Removal of the basement membrane started 2 days postweaning, was maximal at 4 days, and correlated with degeneration of epithelial cells. There was no evidence of phagocytosis of basement membrane, so the removal of this antigen was attributed to enzymatic hydrolysis. To determine the activity of breast homogenate on the specific basement membrane antigen, insoluble basement membrane embedded in agarose gels was incubated with breast liver and kidney homogenates. When basement membrane antigen was demonstrated by the specific antibody, it was found that breast homogenate solubilized basement membrane but liver and kidney failed to solubilize basement membrane. To quantify the reaction and determine some of the characteristics of the responsible enzyme(s), insoluble basement membrane was labeled with 125I and the release of radioactivity into the supernatant following incubation with extracts of involuting breast indicated hydrolysis of basement membrane. Extracts of breast homogenate extensively hydrolyzed labeled basement membrane if naturally occurring inhibitors were removed by previous washing, whereas liver or kidney extracts prepared in a similar manner were devoid of activity. The hydrolysis of basement membrane was time and concentration dependent and had a pH optimum. The reaction was blocked by prior heating of the extract at 100 degrees C. for 30 minutes, removal of divalent cations, and presence of diisopropylfluorophosphate (a specific serine esterase inhibitor); prolonged dialysis failed to remove the hydrolytic activity. It is concluded that an enzyme system present in the involuting breast is capable of basement membrane hydrolysis\n",
      "The effects of dopamine and isoproterenol on the pulmonary circulation. Dopamine and isoproterenol, although used primarily for their inotropic effects, are also potent vasoactive substances. To determine their effects on the pulmonary circulation, we cannulated the left lower lobe bronchus in 20 dogs to permit ventilation with either air or a mixture of 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide; systemic oxygenation was maintained by venitlating the right lung with 95% oxygen. The lobe was perfused at a controlled flow rate and left atrial pressure was held constant. Hypoxic ventilation increased the lobar vascular resistance by 52% (p less than 0.001). Dopamine infusion (20 mcg. per kilogram per minute) during air ventilation also increased lobar vascular resistance by 50% (p less than 0.001). During hypoxic ventilation, dopamine increased the resistance by an additional 19% (p less than 0.001). In contrast, isoproterenol (0.2 mcg. per kilogram per minute) abolished the hypoxic pressor response (p less than 0.001). Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade did not alter hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction, whereas phentolamine blocked the dopamine response and propranolol abolished the isoproterenol-induced vasodilation. These results indicate the following: (1) The hypoxic pressor response is independent of sympathetic innervation; (2) dopamine in dogs is a pulmonary vasoconstrictor; and (3) isoproterenol is a pulmonary vasodilator. If these findings can be extrapolated to man, isoproterenol may be the preferred inotropic agent in patients with an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.\n",
      "Biochemistry of copper. Copper, as a component of numerous cuproenzymes, plays a vital role in many physiologic functions in man and animals. From the stand-point of human health there are at least three functional areas of prime importance. Copper is involved in the development and maintenance of cardiovascular and skeletal integrity, central nervous system structure and function, and erythropoietic function including iron metabolism. Although there is no evidence for widespread copper deficiency in the human population, it does occur, owing to genetic defects and other precipitating factors. A clear understanding of the functions of copper and its mechanisms of action could prove highly beneficial in the solution of present and unforeseen problems in medicine.\n",
      "Effects of dietary saturated and trans fatty acids on cholesteryl ester synthesis and hydrolysis in the testes of rats. Studies were made of the enzymic synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in rat testes. Weanling rats were fed for 14 weeks diets containing 5% by wt of hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO), a concentrate of ethyl elaidate and linolelaidate (TRANS), devoid of essential fatty acids (EFA), or safflower oil (SAFF). Cholesterol esterifying activity was localized in the soluble fraction, and cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity was distributed in both particulate and soluble fractions obtained from tissue homogenates. The optimum pH was 6.0 for esterification and 6.9-7.0 for hydrolysis. Neither esterifying nor hydrolytic activity was affected by freezing and thawing, but both reactions were inhibited by heat or sonication. The animals of both the HCO and TRANS groups had developed an EFA deficiency before they were sacrificed. The EFA deficiency produced upon feeding the HCO diet had no apparent effect on the synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in rat testes. The TRANS diet influenced the development of the testes as judged by their size, and cholesterol esterifying and cholesteryl ester hydrolyzing activities were suppressed in the testes of the animals of this group. A major difference in the effects of the HCO and TRANS diets on the lipids of the tests was the relatively minor amount of eicosatrienoic acid (20:3) and the elevated level of docosapentaenoic acid (22:5) in the cholesteryl esters of the testicular lipids of the TRANS group.\n",
      "Defective lipid disposal mechanisms during bacterial infection in rhesus monkeys. Mechanisms producing hypertriglyceridemia during bacterial sepsis have not been well defined. In this study lipid disposal mechanisms were assessed in 76 infected and 19 control male rhesus monkeys by the ability to dispose of triglycerides after: (1) oral lipid loading; (2) intravenous lipid loading; and (3) by lipolytic enzyme activity tests as measured by postheparin lipolytic activity (PHLA). Studies were performed both before and 48 hr after intravenous inoculation with either Salmonella typhimurium or Diplococcus pneumoniae when illness was uniformly severe and fasting serum triglyceride elevations were increased maximally. S. typhimurium-infected monkeys demonstrated significant fasting hypertriglyceridemia (p is less than 0.001), reduced clearance of orally and intravenously administered lipid and markedly reduced PHLA. During this gram-negative sepsis, mild lethargy, slight diarrhea, and a 2% mortality were observed. During D. pneumoniae sepsis, average fasting triglyceride concentrations were slightly, but not significantly elevated. While oral lipid clearance was impaired, intravenous lipid clearance was unimpaired, and PHLA was slightly reduced. Marked lethargy, agitation, and a 20% mortality were present during this gram-positive infection. Results of this study support the concept that an impairment of lipid disposal mechanisms, particularly during gram-negative sepsis with S. typhimurium, may significantly contribute to the observed hypertriglyceridemia.\n",
      "Sweetening agents from natural sources. Sweetness is an important taste sensation to humans. The absence of suitable sweeteners as alternatives to cyclamates and saccharin has led to a renewed interest in sweeteners form natural sources. A brief review of the history of sweetener usage provides a basis for understanding our present heavy consumption of sweet substances. The structure of naturally-occurring compounds possessing a sweet taste range from simple sugars to complex, intensely sweet proteins. The structural types include monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, flavonoids, steroid saponins, dipeptides, and proteins. Some of these substances are not, strictly-speaking, natural but are derived from natural sources by relatively minor chemical modification. The properties of two non-sweet substances, miraculin and gymnemic acid, are included because of their close relationship to the subject of sweeteners. Miraculin causes sour substances to taste sweet and gymnemic acid selectively blocks sweet taste perception. The second part of the paper presents some of the work on monellin, the intensely sweet protein from \"serendipity berries\" (Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii). The physico-chemical studies of monellin provide convincing evidence that it is, indeed, a protein. Structural studies using denaturants and specific chemical modifications have provided a beginning of our understanding of the molecular basis of the sweet taste of monellin.\n",

      "[Investigations of the lipase activity of a pancreatin compound (author's transl)]. In connection with the physiologic process of digestion, the requirements for an enzyme-based drug are stated. Quick release of highly active enzymes in the duodenum is a prerequisite of physiological stimulation of the pancreatic excretory function. Digestive potency is regarded as a suitable gauge for comparing of results in large-scale in vitro scanning. Our own in vitro and in vivo studies have borne out the possibility of transferring in vitro findings to the therapeutic value of this compound. As shown by our investigations, quick release of highly active enzymes in vitro is coupled with a high degree of bioavailability in Fermento duodenal. As a result, normalization or reduction of the lipid content of faeces--as a sign of therapeutic efficacy--is seen in patients with pancreatic excretory insufficiency. Statistical evaluation resulted in the following: 1 A statistically significant (p less than 0.1%) increase in lipase activity in the duodenal juice in vitro after addition of one capsule of Fermento duodenal. 2. Lipase activity in vivo after 15 minutes is significantly different from all other values. 3. A statistically significant (p less than 1%) drop in the amount and lipid content of faeces following the treatment with Fermento duodenal.\n",

      "Conformational changes in cytochrome aa3 and ATP synthetase of the mitochondrial membrane and their role in mitochondrial energy transduction. 1. The thermodynamics and molecular basis of energy-linked conformational changes in the cytochrome aa3 and ATP synthetase complexes of the mitochondrial membrane have been studied with spectrophotometrical and fluorometrical techniques. 2. Ferric cytochrome aa3 exists in two conformations, high spin and low spin, the equilibrium between these states being controlled by the electrical potential difference across the mitochondrial membrane. The conformational change is brought about by an electrical field-driven binding of one proton per aa3 to the complex. At pH 7.2 the concentration of the two conformations is equal at a membrane potential of 170 mV corresponding to about 4 kcal/mole. 3. The high to low spin transition in ferric aa3 is also induced by hydrolysis of ATP in which case two molecules of aa3 are shifted per ATP molecule hydrolyzed. This is in accordance with translocation of two protons across the mitochondrial membrane coupled to hydrolysis of ATP as proposed in the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation. 4. The conformational transition in cytochrome aa3 is not an expression of the formation of a 'high-energy' intermediate or reversal of the energy-transducing pathway of oxidative phosphorylation, but is presumably the basis of allosteric control of the activity of cytochrome oxidase by the energy state of the mitochondrion. This control is exerted by a regulatory mechanism in which the electrical potential difference controls the conformation and redox properties of the heme centres and thereby the rate of oxygen consumption. 5. The synthesis of one molecule of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation is energetically equivalent to the work done in carrying two electrical charges across the entire mitochondrial membrane. 6. Fluorescence changes of aurovertin bound to ATP synthetase reveal that the electrical membrane potential induces a conformational change in the F1 portion of the enzyme which is probably associated with dissociation of the natural F1 inhibitor protein. This conformational change is energetically equivalent to the work done in carrying one electrical charge across the mitochondrial membrane. 7. A model is proposed for the mechanism of the electrical field-induced conformational changes in the cytochrome aa3 and ATP synthetase complexes, and the significance of these changes in the mechanism and control of mitochondrial energy conservation is discussed.\n",
      "[Old and new dangers of blood transfusion (author's transl)]. The predominant danger of blood transfusion, even after the discovery of the ABO and Rh systems, is the immunological risk. This led in 1940 to a regulation of blood transfusion in Germany by official guidelines which were constantly adjusted in the light of new research results. The dangers due to deterioration on storage still receive too little attention although these may be of greater danger to the patient than immunisation risk. Also the assessment of other medical problems of transfusion is insufficiently applied to clinical routine.\n",
      "Vinyl chloride dependent mutagensis: effects of liver extracts and free radicals. The mutagenic effects of vinyl chloride (VC) on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1530 are enhanced by mouse or rat liver extracts. The extracts prepared from mice pretreated either with vinyl chloride or the microsomal enzyme inducer, Aroclor 1254, did not produce any greater stimulation of VC-dependent mutagenesis than extracts from untreated animals. These same extracts, however, differed markedly in their capacity to stimulate the mutagenicity of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), a compound which is converted to a mutagen by an NADPH dependent microsomal mixed function oxidase. The order of activity of the extracts with DMN was Aroclor pretreated is greater than untreated is greater than VC pretreated. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of the liver extracts on VC mediated mutagenesis did not require NADPH and was still evident in liver extracts in which the microsomal mixed function oxidase system had been heat inactivated. The mutagenic activity of VC also was found to be stimulated by riboflavin in the presence of light suggesting that free radicals may be involved in VC dependent mutagenesis.\n",
      "Testicular function after orchiopexy for unilaterally undescended testis. Testicular function was determined in 29 men, 21 to 35 years old, who had undergone orchiopexy for unilaterally undescended testis at four to 12 years of age. Serum testosterone and dialyzable testosterone concentrations of these men were not significantly different from those of a control group of 30 normal men, and their basal serum luteinizing hormone concentrations and serum luteinizing hormone responses to synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone were only slightly higher than those of the normal men. The mean sperm density of the patients, however, was only one third of that of the normal men (p less than 0.001). The mean serum follicle stimulating hormone response ro gonadotropin-releasing hormone of the patients was doubled that of the normal men (p less than 0.001). The data indicate that spermatogenesis may be abnormal after orchipexy, and suggest that men with unilaterally undescended testis may have bilateral testicular abnormality.\n",
      "[Isolation and characterization of main albumin fractions of seeds from sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and rape (Brassica napus L.)]. The main fractions of the albumins from sunflower and rapeseeds (isolated by means of precipitation with ammonium sulphate or tannin + caffeine and subsequent gel chromatography) are low-molecular, very basic proteins. Their molecular weights range from 10 000 to 16 000, and their isoelectric points (determined by isoelectric focusing and free electrophoresis) are situated at pH greater than 10.0. From the circular dichroism in the wavelength range from 200 to 240 nm it is deduced that the main fraction of the rape albumin is a well-structured protein with 40-46% alpha-helix in aqueous and salt-containing solutions. Denaturation by heating is achieved only at temperatures about 100 degrees C and pH values greater than 9. 20% alpha-helix are left after the action of 8 M urea. This conformational stability is explained by the presence of disulphide linkages in the molecule.\n",
      "[Effect of acid polysaccharides on properties of pancreatic proteases]. The use of acid polysaccharides (sodium alginate, pectin, carrageenan, etc.) as gel-forming agents in the manufacture of artificial foods excites the interest in the study of their effects on the enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract. In this connection, the authors investigated the action of various acid polysaccharides on the kinetics of the hydrolysis of low-molecular substrates catalyzed by pancreatic proteinases. It was shown that the intereactions between acid polysaccharides and enzymes produce effects which can be fully explained by changes in the apparent ionization constants of the ionogenic groups which participate in the catalytic reaction. The extent of the effects observed in presumably determined by the strength of the electrostatic potential which is generated by polyanions.\n",
      "[Interaction between proteins and acid polysaccharides]. The intereaction between proteins and acid polysaccharides is electrostatic in nature and leads to the formation of soluble charged and insoluble neutral complexes. The complex formation in the system casein-dextran sulphate is followed by means of turbidimetric titration. It depends on the pH value and the electrolyte concentration. On free electrophoresis, complexes formed below the isoelectric point of the protein exhibit anodic mobility, whereas pure casein migrates to the cathode. The protein in the complex is not able to bind amido black. Consequently, it cannot be detected electrophoretically by dyebinding. The results from viscosity and diffusion measurements are indicative of an increased hydrodynamic volume of the complexes.\n",
      "[Isolation of proteins with complex forming agents]. Taking vegetable albumins for models, the authors report of the possibilities of isolating proteins (which cannot be precipitated isoelectrically) by using their property of forming complexes with tannin or poly-anions. The precipitation of proteins with dextran sulphate or polyphosphates, which is due to electrostatic interaction, depends on the pH value and the electrolyte content of the solution. Under appropriate experimental conditions, protein yields of 100% are achieved. By means of tannin, the proteins are completely precipitated in a wide range of pH. The protein component of the poly-anion-containing complexes is isolated by precipitation with salt or by thermal coagulation after dissolving of the complexes. The isolation of protein from the tannin complexes is preferably realized by reaction with coffeine.\n",
      "[Technological directions for processing rape proteins into protein concentrates and isolates]. Rape-seeds or rape-seed meal are relatively cheap, but valuable raw materials for the manufacture of protein concentrates and isolates which may be used as constituents of foodstuffs. The high content of crude fibres and also of thioglucosides leads to considerable difficulties in the development of techniques for the manufacture of high-grade protein preparations. To describe the procedure, certain production-technological properties of rape proteins are discussed, such as extraction parameters, coagulating conditions, processing temperature, amount of solvent, etc. On the basis of these data, the following techniques for the manufacture of rape protein products are presented: - protein concentration by means of the water diffusion method; - protein isolation with the aid of one or multi-stage extraction. Finally, the author reports of a fermenting procedure for the manufacture of protein biomass from coarse colza meal. Furthermore, he presents some data about the nutritional value of rape protein.\n",
      "[Mass transfer in production of milk protein coprecipitates]. During the last twenty years heat coagulation has become a more important technical procedure for the isolation of milk proteins because of its very efficient utilization of raw material. Experiments are reported to get approximation equations for the mass transfer in the production of milk protein coprecipitates from skim milk and mixtures of skim milk with rennet and acid whey by means of statistical planning and interpreting of experiments. Good exactness was reached. The coagula consist of casein fractions, whey protein fractions, calcium, and phosphates. The products are thermically rather stable, sensorically indifferent and contain water insoluble protein. They are suitable to improve the fat: protein ration of sausages, but also for the protein enrichment of other foods and for dietetic purposes.\n",
      "[The effect of novocaine on the electrical activity of nodes of Ranvier in high  and low pH solutions]. The minimal concentrations of procaine which block the action potentials of a single Ranvier node were determined under decreased and increased pH in the bathing solution. The changes in concentrations of the basic [B] and cationic [BH+] form of procaine with pH were of monotonic character: [B] drops and [BH+] grows with pH increase. The dependence of membrane excitability (fraction of channels are able to excite)  on pH was nonmonotonic; it is low under increased and decreased pH. On the basis of these data the hypothesis that the membrane of the Ranvier node may interact with a definite form of procaine is rejected. T he quantitative analysis shows that the membrane interacts with both the basic and cationic forms of procaine but the efficiency of this interaction is different.\n",
      "[The effect of the pH of the external solution on posttetanic hyperpolarization of a denuded nerve]. A decrease in pH of the external solution from 7.3 to 5.3 causes an increase in post-tetanic hyperpolarization, while an increase in pH to 9 causes its decrease. The time-course of the hyperpolarization was increased at low pH and reduced at high pH. The possibility of a change in the electrogenicity  of the sodium pump induced by changes in pH is discussed.\n",
      "Kinetics of thymus-derived lymphocyte count changes in rats affected by graft-versus-host reaction. The effect of GVHR on thymus-dependent lymphocytes of various lymphoid organs has been followed autoradiographically and by scintillation technique in a temporal dependence on the induction of the reaction. GVHR was induced in (BD X Lw) F1 hybrid rats with parental spleen (BD) cells. As marker of the thymus-dependent lymphocytes the in vitro 3H-uridine incorporation was used. Compared to B cells, T lymphocytes of rats have a higher ability of incorporating labeled uridine. T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the thoracic duct achieved their peak at 3 or 4 days following GVHR induction. On the fourth day, simultaneously with a GVH-altered thymus a rapid decline in the number of these cells was also observed. A mobilization of T lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes into the circulation already in the very first days of the reaction might be responsible for the peak seen in PBL and TDL. The GVH-alteration lasting 21 days caused an evident reduction of thymus-dependent lymphocytes in all the organs studied here. The immunological attack of GVHR is considered to be primarily responsible for the exhaustion of T cells. The discussion bears on the possibility of a more progressive action of GVHR on the more mature T lymphocyte subpopulation.\n",
      "Effect of chlorogenic acid in a casein diet for rats. Nutritional and pathological observations. 3-week-old male rats were fed on a casein diet containing 1% (w/w) of chlorogenic acid in order to find out if the ingestion of chlorogenic acid may be associated with a reduced utilization of dietary proteins or with causing other adverse effects. The protein efficiency ratio, biological value and digestibility of this diet did not differ from a corresponding casein diet free from chlorogenic acid. No change was observed in the nitrogen balance of the experimental rats. Neither did the rats show any change in hematological values or volumes and pH of the urine. Some deviation was noticed in the weights of kidneys and adrenals of the chlorogec acid-free casein diet. The findings that were made were normal in the microscopic examinations of various organs. Chlorogenic acid did not seem to influence the ultrastructure of the liver as revealed by electron microscopy.\n",
      "Influence of experimental dietary conditions on hepatic enzymes of glutamic acid metabolism in rats. The lowering levels of dietary protein induced a significant fall of some hepatic enzymes associated with glutamic acid metabolism.

For the study of the effect of a treatment on a neuromediator, the determination of the turnover rate is often more interesting than the determination of the endogenous level of the mediator.

      "Changes in tyrosine transaminase and phosphoenolpyruvate kinase activities during short term incubation of fetal liver. Incubation of fetal rat liver homogenates at 37 degrees for 2-3 hr increased PEPK activity in the 100,000 X g supernatant 5-fold and TTA activity 10-fold. At the same time, activity in the 100,000 X g pellet decreaed and no change was observed in the whole homogenate. It is concluded that during incubation of fetal liver pieces or homogenates in vitro, a redistribution of enzymes occurs between cell particles and cell sap. It is suggested that release of enzyme into the cell sap may be the first stimulus for subsequent enzyme synthesis which occurs after birth.\n",
      "Oxygen transport in congenital heart disease: influence of fetal hemoglobin, red cell pH, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. In 48 individuals (age 1 day to 13 years) with congenital heart disease, blood oxygen transport function was studied in order to evaluate adaptive changes in shunt hypoxemia and to investigate the in vivo regulation of erythrocyte 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate concentration (RBC 2, 3-DPG) in the presence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Arterial pO2 and oxygen content, oxygen capacity, acid base status, oxygen affinity, HbF fraction, plasma pH, red cell pH, and RBC 2, 3-DPG were determined. During the first 50 days of life values of standard P50 (stdP50) (37, pH 7.4), actual in vivo P50 (actP50), RBC 2, 3-DPG, O2 capacity, arterial plasma pH, and red cell pH were scattered around the normal range, although tending to low values for stdP50 and arterial plasma pH and to high values for O2 capacity. After the third month, stdP50 actP50, RBC 2, 3-DPG, O2 capacity, and red cell pH were found to be elevated. Plasma pH and actP50 were scattered around the normal range (Figs. 1 and 2). Intraerythrocytic pH in hypoxemic infants was increased compared with normal children when related to plasma pH (Fig. 3). A close to normal intraerythrocytic pH was therefore found in the hypoxemic infants with low plasma pH, and an increased intraerythrocytic pH in the hypoxemic children with normal plasma pH (Fig. 1). A significant negative correlation exists between erythrocyte H+ ion and 2, 3-DPG concentration (Fig. 5); regression constants derived from data at high (mean 47%) and low (mean 9%) fractions of HbF are not significantly different (Regression Equations 8 and 11 in Table 1). Thus, the known difference in 2, 3-DPG binding to fetal or adult deoxyhemoglobin does not measurably influence the erythrocyte 2, 3-DPG concentration, indicating that in vivo the 2, 3-DPG synthesis in hypoxia is virtually regulated by the erythrocyte pH, which in turn is determined by plasma pH and the oxygenation state of hemoglobin.\n",
      "Dual effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate on the Bohr effects of human blood. The influence of the red cell concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG, 0.5-26 mumoles/g erythrocytes) on the \"CO2-Bohr effect\" (pH varied by CO2 at constant base excess) and the \"fixed acid-Bohr effect\" (pH varied by fixed acid or base at constant PCO2) was studied in human blood at plasma pH values ranging between pH 7.2 and pH 7.6. Elevation of red cell 2,3-DPG concentration leads to a numerical decrease of the \"CO2-Bohr coefficient\" referring to plasma pH. The \"fixed acid-Bohr coefficients\" are numerically smaller than the corresponding \"CO2-Bohr coefficients\" and exhibit a maximum at normal red cell 2,3-DPG concentrations. The Bohr coefficients referring to red cell pH are distinctly higher than those referring to plasma pH, especially at high 2,3-DPG levels. This is due on the one hand to the physico-chemical properties of the intact red cell membrane, and on the other hand to a 2,3-DPG-induced decrease in the ratio deltapHcell/deltapHplasma. From the results it is concluded that 2,3-DPG exerts a dual effect on the Bohr coefficients of whole blood which is mediated 1. by the direct effect of 2,3-DPG on the allosteric properties of hemoglobin (as reflected by changes of the Bohr coefficients referring to red cell pH), and 2. by the effect of 2,3-DPG on deltapHcell/deltapHplasma.\n",
      "Influence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate on the buffering properties of human blood: role of the red cell membrane. The effect of the concentration of red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG, 0.5-21 mumoles/g cells) on the buffering properties and on the slope of the relation between the extracellular and intracellular pH (deltapHi/deltapHe) of human blood was studied. The results were evaluated in connection with previous findings concerning the effect of 2,3-DPG on the Donnan ratio rH+ = H+e/H+i. deltapHi/deltapHe decreases with rising red cell 2,3-DPG content as well as with rising extracellular pH. deltapHi/deltapHe and rH+ can be related to each other by the empirical equation deltapHi/deltapHe = 1 + log rH+ = 1 + pHi - pHe. The validity of this equation appears to be restricted to conditions where the Donnan ratio rH+ is altered between 0.3 and 1 either by changes of the red cell concentration of buffering anions such as 2,3-DPG or by changes of the extracellular pH. As determined in suspensions of red cells with intact membranes, the 2,3-DPG-and pH-induced changes of deltapHi/deltapHe lead to proportional changes in the buffering power of the non-bicarbonate buffers of erythrocytes. Due to this effect the buffering power of suspensions of cells containing 5 times the normal concentration of the buffer 2,3-DPG is lower than that of cells with normal 2,3-DPG content (at extracellular pH values above 7). These findings demonstrate that the action of intracellular non-bicarbonate buffers in blood is effectively modulated by the physico-chemical properties of the red cell membrane.\n",
      "Conformation and reactivity of DNA in the complex with proteins. III. Helix-coil transition and conformational studies of model complexes of DNA's with poly-L-histidine. Differences in the interaction of poly-L-histidine with DNA of various base composition have been demonstrated using melting and CD measurements. The two types of complexes formed with DNA at pH values below the pK of 5.9 and in the region of pH 6.5 are very different in their CD spectral properties. The binding effects with highly protonated poly-L-histidine are AT-dependent as reflected by large negative CD spectra indicating the formation of psi-DNA as a condensed state of the double helix. GC-rich DNA may, however, also form psi-DNA structures with poly-L-histidine under certain conditions. At pH 6.5 complex formation with the weakly protonated polypeptide is GC-dependent. From the results it is concluded that protonated poly-L-histidine interacts more specifically at AT base pairs, prabably along the small groove while the weakly protonated poly-L-histidine tends to interact preferentially with GC regions which seems to occur rather in the large groove.\n",
      "Conformation and reactivity of DNA in the complex with protein. IV. Circular dichroism of poly-L-histidine model complexes with DNA polymers and specificity of the interaction. The CD study of the DNA-poly-L-histidine complex at high degree of protonation revealed that complex formation is already observable at 2 M NaCl. The influence of salt together with 5 M urea suggests that in addition to electrostatic interactions probably hydrogen bonding may favour specific complexes. Affinity of protonated histidines to AT-rich regions is strongly supported by the complexes formed with (dA.dT)-containing polymers. The psi-type structure occurs with poly(dA-dT)-poly(dA-dT) while poly(dA)-poly(dT) is restricted to form a similar psi-state on interaction with highly protonated poly-L-histidine. Differences in the helix winding properties due to variation in the sequence is suggested as a possible factor in the formation of the psi-type complexes. The mechanism of interaction including hydrogen bonding of histidine side-chains with an AT pair at high degree of protonation and with GC-regions at lower degree of protonation in the polypeptide structure is discussed.\n",
      "Effect of excision of the Y-base on the interaction of tRNAPhe (yeast) with phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (yeast). The interaction between tRNAPhe (yeast), from which the Y-base has been removed by acid treatment, and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (yeast) has been investigated by fluorescence competition titrations and sedimentation velocity runs. The binding parameters are given under various ionic conditions. The tRNAPhe-Y still can occupy the specific binding sites on the enzyme. Compared to unmodified tRNAPhe, the binding constant is lowered by more than one order of magnitude. It can be concluded that the Y-base is not necessary for specific recognition of tRNAPhe by the cognate synthetase, it rather may represent a point of attachment for the synthetase.\n",
      "Distribution of histones in alkali-denatured chromatin studied by isopycnic centrifugation in alkaline metrizamide density gradients. Three types of density gradients - neutral metrizamide, alkaline NaOH-metrizamide and alkaline triethanolamine-metrizamide - were used for studying the distribution of histones between the two DNA strands in alkali-denatured chromatin. It was found possible to avoid both protein redistribution and dissociation by using triethanolamine-metrizamide density gradients at pH 10.5. Under these conditions an alkali-denatured mixture of DNA and chromatin was well separated into the original DNA and DNP. When native or sonicated chromatin was denatured at pH 12.2 and centrifuged in a triethanolamine-metrizamide density gradient at pH 10.5 no peak of free DNA appeared. These results show that both DNA strands remain associated with histone molecules upon alkaline denaturation of chromatin.\n",

A convenient method is suggested for synthesis of uracil-1-malonic acid diethyl ester by alkylating 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyl) uracil with bromo-malonic acid diethyl ester. This compound has been shown to hydrolyze with NaOH yielding either uracil or uracil-1-acetic acid, depending on reaction conditions. Similarly, thymine-1-malinic acid diethyl ester and 5-fluorouracil-1,3-dimalonic acid tetraethyl ester were obtained. 1-(1,3-Dihydroxypropyl)uracil has been obtained by reducing uracil-1-malonic acid diethyl ester with NaBH4.\n",
      "Preparation and properties of poly 2'-O-ethylcytidylic acid. Poly 2'0-ethylcytidylic acid (poly (Ce)) was prepared by polymerization of 2'-0-ethylcytidine-5'-pyrophosphate with Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase in the presence of Mn++, and its properties compared with those of poly (rC), poly (Cm) and poly (dC). The neutral form of pOLY (Ce) exhibits properties similar to those of poly (rC) and poly (Cm). It also forms an acid twin-stranded helix with a transition pH of 5.9 in 0.1 M NaCl. The neutral form readily forms a double-stranded helical complex with poly (rI). Relative to poly (Cm), replacement of the 2'-0-methyl by 2-0-ethyl leads to increased enhancement of the thermal stabilities of both the acid helical form of poly (Ce) and its complex with poly (rI).\n",
      "O2'-Methylinosine, a constituent of the ribosomal RNA of Crithidia fasciculata. A novel nucleoside, O2'-methylinosine (Im), has been identified as a constituent of the ribosomal RNA of Crithidia fasciculata, a hemoflaggelate protozoan. The nucleoside is released as part of an alkali-stable dinucleotide, Im-Up, by alkaline hydrolysis of Crithidia rRNA, and as a 5'-nucleotide, pIm, by snake venom hydrolysis of the same RNA. The Im-containing derivatives isolated from Crithidia rRNA were characterized by comparison with marker compounds prepared by chemical deamination of the corresponding adenosine analogues. O2'-Methylinosine prepared from either natural Im-Up or natural pIm had the same ultraviolet absorption spectra and chromatographic properties as marker Im. Characterization of the base and sugar components of Im as hypoxanthine and 2-O-methylribose, respectively, provided final confimration of structure. Control experiments have eliminated the possibility that Im arises from O2'-methyladenosine (Am), a known constituent of ribosomal RNA, by chemical or enzymatic deamination during hydrolysis of Crithidia rRNA.\n",
      "Observations and interpretation of x-ray absorption edges in iron compounds and proteins. X-ray absorption spectra near the Kalpha edge have been measured in various iron group compounds using the intense synchrotron radiation at the Stanford Synchrotron Research Project. In the cubic compounds KMF3 where M = Mn+2, Fe+2, Co+2, Ni+2, and Zn+2, well resolved lines were observed and assigned to the 1s leads to 3d, 1s leads to 4s, and 1s leads to 4p transitions. The observed energies agreed rather well with the spectroscopic energy levels of the Z + 1 ion and the intensities are shown to agree with those expected on the basis of one electron transitions of the form Z 1s2dn(L,S) leads to (Z + 1)1s2dnn'l'(L\",S). The energies of the intense 1s leads to 4p transition increase by about 5 V going from KFeF3 to K2NaFeF6, but only by about 1 V from K4Fe(CN)6 to K3Fe(CN)6. The transitions confirm that upon oxidation of the hexacyanides the iron electronic structure barely changes. In the iron sulfur protein rubredoxin, where the iron is bound to a tetrahedron of sulfurs, the 1s leads to 3d transition was about seven times more intense than the same transition in an octahedrally coordinated compound. These intensities parallel those observed in the d-d transitions of optical spectra, because in both types of spectra the intensities depend upon 4p admixture. In the heme protein cytochrome c, upon oxidation the 1s leads to 4p transition shifts only about 1 V to higher energies similar to the iron hexacyanides. These results are discussed in terms of covalent bonding.\n",

      "Desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors by beta-adrenergic agonists in a cell-free system: resensitization by guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate and other purine nucleotides. Incubation of purified frog erythrocyte membranes with beta-adrenergic agonists at 25 degrees produces relatively rapid (half-time about 10 min) desensitization (inactivation) of about 60% of the beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites. The desensitized receptors no longer bind the specific beta-adrenergic ligand (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol. The decrease in the number of functional beta-adrenergic receptors is also manifest as a decreased ability of isoproterenol to stimulate the membrane-bound adenylate cyclase.\n",

Four site-specific endodeoxyribonucleases have been partially purified from extracts of bacteriophage T5-infected Escherichia coli by gel filtration and affinity chromatography on single- and double-stranded DNA. The enzymes were detected and characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis of alkali-denatured digestion products. None of the four is found in uninfected cells. In the presence of a divalent cation, all four endonucleases make ligase-repairable, single-chain interruptions at specific sites in the duplex DNA of several bacteriophages (lambda, T7, and T5) and a mammalian virus (adenovirus 2). These activities are not stimulated by ATP. None of the four is active on single-stranded DNA.

Mice with the X-chromosomal sparse-fur (spf) mutation frequently have urinary bladder stones composed mostly of orotic acid, which was identified by the following criteria: ultraviolet and infrared absorption, spectra, chromatographic behavior, melting point, and reactivity in a specific color test. This clue led to the discovery that spf-bearing mice have an abnormal form of liver ornithine carbamoyltransferase (carbamoylphosphate:L-ornithine carbamoyltransferase, EC 2.1.3.3). Normal ornithine carbamoyltransferase has maximum activity at pH 7.6-8.0 and 80% of maximum activity at pH 10.0.\n",

The first three larval stages of the lobster Homarus gammarus are pelagic swimming animals. A description is given of the exopodite apparatus of the thoracic appendages that provide lift and propulsive power in these stages. Setal arrangement and display provides greater surface area during power strokes. Musculature is peculiar to the exopodites and concerned with rotational movements of the appendage.

      "A quantitative analysis of exopodite beating in the larvae of the lobster Homarus gammarus (L.). Raw data on exopodite beating in the first three developmental stages of the lobster Homarus gammarus were collected and analysed for key beating parameters. The analysis was computer assisted and the main procedures used are described. Beating patterns are the same in all three stages and are usually very regular although perturbations do occur (figures 1, 2). When beating stops the deceleration and subsequent re-acceleration is very rapid (figure 1) and limb movement sequences usually start posteriorly and move forwards (figures 1, 2d). Ipsilateral phase relations are generally maintained at 0.4-0.6 (figures, 3,4) and while the coupling between adjacent exopodites is usually stronger than for those further apart various deviations from this are occasionally seen (figure 5). No significant correlation between the ipsilateral phase relations of adjacent exopodites and base cycle duration was detected for any of the stages (figure 6). Contralateral phase relations undergo a constant progression (figures 7, 9) and this was found to be due to a heterodyne effect (figure 8) also described as gliding coordination. The powerstroke/returnstroke ratio for all stages was approximately 0.5 (figure 10) and no significant correlation was found with cycle duration (figure 11). The only substantial difference between the three larval stages which was noted was that of cycle duration, the cycles of stage III being shorter than those of the first two stages. The exopodite beating pattern was discussed in context with other metachronously cycling systems in arthropods and the implications of the present study discussed.\n",

A study has been made of the interrelations between rhythmical exopodite beating in different larval stages and swimmeret beating in poast-larval stages of the lobster Homarus gammarus. Data on exopodite beat cycle durations have been used for statistical comparisons of exopodite performance within one larva, and also between different stages of larval development. Inter-exopodite comparisons reveal clear bilateral differences (table 1), although there is no consistently favoured relationship (tables 2 and 3). There are significant differences in cycle duration between the first three developmental stages, with a slight increase at the first moult, and a marked decrease at the second (table 4). However, within each stage the repeat frequency exhibits little change (table 5). Therefore it appears that changes in swimming behaviour occur discontinuously in development, and are associated with the larval moults. It is suggested that changes in beat frequency, and especially the faster beating in stage III, may represent responses to changed loading conditions (table 7). Measurements of swimmeret beating in post-larval lobsters have been analysed in terms of cycle durations, and inter- and intra-segmental phase relations. Swimmeret beating patterns are very regular (figure 1), but not restricted to a narrow range of frequencies (table 6a). Intersegmental phase lag remains constant around 0.2 (figure 3) independent of beat frequency (figure 4). Similarly the powerstroke/returnstroke ratio of approximately 0.5 (figure 5) shows no significant correlation with cycle duration (figure 6). Differences emerge in the performance of larval exopodites and post-larval swimmerets (table 6b), although the possibility cannot be excluded that the larval exopodite oscillator in some way influences the developing action of the post-larval swimmeret system.\n",
      "The nervous system of Loligo. II. Suboesophageal centres. A well-marked hierarchy of centres can be recognized within the suboesophageal lobes and ganglia of the arms. The inputs and outputs of each lobe are described. There are sets of motoneurons and intermediate motor centres, which can be activated either from the periphery or from above. They mostly do not send fibres up to the optic or higher motor centres. However, there is a large set of fibres running from the magnocellular lobe to all the basal supraoesophageal lobes. The centre for control of the four eye-muscle nerves in the anterior lateral pedal lobe receives many fibres direct from the statocyst and from the peduncle and basal lobes, but none direct from the optic lobe. The posterior lateral pedal is a backward continuation of the oculomotor centre, containing large cells that may be concerned in initiating attacks by the tentacles. An intermediate motor centre in the posterior pedal lobe probably controls steering. It sends fibres to the funned and head retractors, and by both direct and interrupted pathways to the fin lobe. It receives fibres from the crista nerve and basal lobes, but none direct from the optic lobe. The jet control centre of the ventral magnocellular lobe receives fibres from the statocyst and skin and also from the optic and basal lobes. Some of these last also give extensive branches throughout the palliovisceral lobes. The branching patterns of the dendritic collaterals differ in the various lobes. Some estimates are given of the numbers of synaptic points. The dendritic collaterals of the motoneurons spread through large volumes of neuropil and they overlap. The incoming fibres spread widely and each presumably activates many motoneurons either together or serially. Many of the lobes contain numerous microneurons with short trunks restricted to the lobe, but there are none of these cells in the chromatophore lobes or fin lobes. The microneurons have only few dendritic collaterals, in contrast to the numerous ones on the nearby motoneurons.\n",

      "Dystonic reactions following neuroleptics: time course and proposed mechanisms. The occurrence of acute dystonic reactions was studied relative to drug pharmacokinetic parameters following a single dose of the phenothiazine, butaperazine. Dystonias occurred more than one half-life from peak butaperazine levels, 23 to 56 h after drug administration. The authors postulate that the appearance of dystonias on falling plasma concentrations may be due to disruption of dopaminergic-cholinergic balance caused by differential antidopaminergic and anticholinergic potencies of the drug.\n",
      "Lysosomal and neutral hydrolase activity during the regression of cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was produced in rats by constriction of the ascending aorta. Removal of the constricting band 10 days after operation resulted in rapid decline in left ventricular (LV) weight and total ventricular RNA. Activities of acid RNase and beta-glucuronidase were elevated 3 days after aortic constriction. Activities of cathepsin D and alkaline RNase were unchanges. Activities of cathepsin  D and acid RNase were unchanged 1 and 3 days after removal of constricting band. Ca2+-activated, neutral protease (CAF) isolated from postmitochondrial muscle supernatant was partially purified and characterized. CAF specifically degrades alpha-actinin when incubated with isolated myofibriles in the presence of Ca2+.\n",
      "Reduced myocardial ATP and creatine phosphate in diabetes: role of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Observations are presented which suggest that myocardial cellular hypoxia may account for the reduction in myocardial ATP and CP in the ketoacidotic diabetic state. It is suggested that reduced 2,3-diphosphoglycerate adversely affects oxygen release from the red blood cell, thereby leading to myocardial cellular hypoxia.\n",
      "Early changes in myocardial hypoxia: relations among mechanical function, pH, and intracellular redox states. When rat hearts were subjected to abrupt hypoxia the onset of NADH changes as measured by epicardial fluorescence and of depressed contractility occurred at similar times. Direct measurements of changes in tissue metabolism lagged behind changes in fluorescence and contractility. Calculated NAD:NADH ratios became reduced more rapidly and to a greater extent in the cytoplasm than in the mitochondria, but did not necessarily signal greater changes in total NADH. The detection of depressed contractility before a fall in intracellular pH or a rise in intracellular lactate casts doubt on the postulate that an increase in hydrogen ion is the primary cause of hypoxic myocardial failure.\n",
      "Inhibition of glycolysis in hearts during ischemic perfusion. Rates of glycolysis were determined in the isolated perfused rat heart under aerobic, anoxic, and ischemic conditions. The rate was accelerated in anoxic and was inhibited in ischemic tissue. Glycolytic inhibition developed at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase and was associated with accumulation of high levels of tissue lactate and H+.\n",
      "Muscarinic stimulation of cardiac guanylate cyclase. Right ventricular kitten papillary muscles were incubated with dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (db-cAMP) at varying concentrations from 1 X 10(-4) M to 1 X 10(-3) M. A positive inotropic effect was observed with all concentrations of db-cAMP. Concomitant administration of 5 X 10(-4) M monobutyryl guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate and 1--2 X 10(-4) M db-cAMP did not produce an inotropic response. At the biochemical level cardiac guanyl cyclase activity is enhanced 2--3 times with acetylcholine and this enhancement is completely blocked by atropine. This increased activity appears to be the result of a decrease in the Michaelis constant (Km) for GTP. Calcium also produces a significant activation of guanyl cyclase activity.\n",
      "Distribution of lysosome populations in rat cardiac tissue. The post-nuclear fraction of rat heart tissue was fractionated by isopycnic zonal centrifugation in sucrose gradients, followed by differential centrifugation of the zonal fractions (rho-S fractionation). The distribution of 5 lysosomal acid hydrolases, a protease with neutral and alkaline activity and several marker enzymes for cell organelles (catalase, Ca2+-ATPase, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase and muramidase) were studied. Three major lysosomal populations were described with equilibrium densities of 1.09, 1.17, and 1.23 gms cc-1 (omega2t = 1.54 X 10(11) rad2 sec-1), and a continuum in the size of these particles at the three different densities.\n",
      "Phospholipase A and acid lipase activity during release of lysosomal hydrolases. Hydrolysis of cardiac and hepatic lysosomal phospholipids by endogenous phospholipase A occurs during incubation at 37 degrees C at pH 5.0. Lysophospholipids and free fatty acids accumulate in association with release of hydrolases from the lysosomes into the supernatant. Acid-active neutral lipid lipases contribute to the release of free fatty acids. Albumin inhibits the production of these surface-active lipids as well as the release of hydrolases. The soluble phospholipase A is inhibited by albumin, soluble protein (cytoplasmic), heparin, and protamine sulfate. Thus, hydrolysis of lysosomal lipids, catalyzed by endogenous phospholipases, as well as acid-active neutral lipid lipases, may contribute significantly to the increased permeability, swelling, and subsequent lysis of lysosomes. Stabilization of the lysosomal membrane is associated with integrity of the structural lipids of the membrane.\n",
      "Some properties of rat myocardial ornithine decarboxylase and the in vitro effects of nucleotides. Myocardial ornithine decarboxylase appears to have characteristics similar to those of enzymes isolated from other tissues. Ornithine decarboxylase activity decreased very rapidly after the death of the animal. Storage of the cell sap fraction at 0 degrees C or -15 degrees C, however, led to only a small decrease in the enzyme activity up to 3 days after preparation. Pyridoxal phosphate at an optimum of 50 muM was essential for full enzyme activity. Thiol compounds did not increase the myocardial ornithine decarboxylase enzyme activity. The subcellular distribution of the enzyme in the myocardium was found to be different from that reported in other tissues. A partial purification of the enzyme was possible using the proteins precipitated at pH 5 from a cell-soluble fraction or by passing a soluble fraction through a Sephadex G 100 gel column. ATP, ADP, and AMP inhibited ornithine decarboxylase at high concentrations (5 mM), but GTP, CTP, and ITP inhibited at a 1 mM concentration and above.\n",
      "Comparative aspects of buffering capacity in muscle. These findings are discussed in relation to the contention that a high buffer value is linked to a high work performance. This generalization does not extend to the \"white\" breast muscle of chicken. Its high buffer value is in part due to a high content of the dipeptides carnosine and anserine. Additionally, a hypothesis is advanced that muscle, e.g. pigeon breast muscle, can in part regulate intracellular pH by changes in the steady state concentrations of the glycolytic and citric acid cycle acids. Notably this form of pH regulation has no inherent energy requirement.\n",
      "Cardiac and skeletal muscle acid-base composition during metabolic acidosis in dogs. Nephrectomized, open chested dogs were infused with 25-30 ml.kg(-1) body weight of 0.15 M NaCl (group I), 0.15 MHCl (Group II) or 0.3 M lactic acid (Group) III). Pulmonary ventilation was maintained constant in the three groups. Intracellular pH was calculated with the CO2 method. No significant intracellular or extracellular acid-base changes were produced in Group I. A similar degree of extracellular acidosis was achieved in Groups II and III. In spite of constant arterial PCO2, the PCO2 of mixed, coronary sinus and femoral vanous blood increased moderately after the infusion in Groups II and III. It was calculated that less than half of the HCl acid infused remained in the extracellular space. However, no significant changes were observed in the acid-base composition of skeletal muscle in either Group II or III. Comparison of the cardiac muscle cell acid-base composition of Group I with that of Groups II and III whows that metabolic acidosis of the degree and duration produced in these experiments does not produce appreciable myocardial acidosis.\n",
      "Dependence of CSF on plasma bicarbonate during hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia. We have previoulsy shown pH compensation to be similar in CSF and arterial blood during chronic hypoxemic hypocapnia in man and pony, and postulated that the compensatory reduction in CSF [HCO3] was dependent upon corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. We tested this hypothesis in anesthetized, paralyzed dogs by determining the effects of 7 or 14 hours of hypocapnia (PaCO2 20 and 30 mm Hg), hypoxemia (PaO2 30, 38 and 48 mm Hg) and hypocapnic hypoxemia on CSF acid-base status. [hco3]a was either permitted to fall normally or was held near control levels by NaHCO3 infusion. In hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia, the decrease in [HCO3] and % pH compensation in CSF were less than or equal to that in arterial blood. Most (51-89%) of the compensatory decrease in CSF [HCO3] was prevented by preventing the corresponding reduction in [HCO3]a. This dependence of changes in CSF on plasma [HCO3] required a concurrent decrease in CSF PCO2, but was largely independent of variations in plasma pH. A minor but significant portion of the decrease in CSF [HCO3] was achieved independently of corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. The contribution of this local mechanism to CSF [HCO3] regulation increased with increasing severity of hypocapnia or hypoxemia and was usually associated with a selective increase in CSF lactate. It was concluded that [HCO3] regulation in the CSF during hypoxemic hypocapnia was primarily dependent upon, and therefore limited by, the concomitant decrease in plasma [HCO3].\n",
      "Response to jejunal acidification in man. I. Changes in composition of perfusate. The jejunal disposal of perfused acid was studied in 11 control subjects and 12 patients with duodenal ulcer. It was found that the capacity to dispose of acid was saturable and was less than control in patients with duodenal ulcer. When the load of acid was small, all the acid disappeared from the jejunum and sodium bicarbonate could be aspirated. During acid perfusion there was secretion of water and electrolytes into the jejunum if the load of acid exceeded the dissipative capacity. Superimposed intravenous infusion of secretin and cholecystokinin increased acid disposal, particularly in patients with duodenal ulcer, and increased the associated rate of secretion of water and electrolytes or changed net absorption to net secretion. We conclude, firstly, that acid is removed from the jejunum by secreted bicarbonate, and secondly that the whole of the upper small intestine of patients with duodenal ulcer is functionally abnormal.\n",
      "The hydrolysis and absorption of conjugated folates in man. After ingestion of synthetic PteGlu3 in physiological doses, the folate forms were studied in plasma obtained from human vena portae blood. Plasma conjugase was inhibited by rapid heat-denaturation. The folate forms were assayed with L. casei and S. faecalis and identified by thin-layer chromatography (biautography). Mono- and diglutamic folate was demonstrated in the portal plasma, indicating that intestinal hydrolysis precedes the absorption of conjugated folates. The pteroylpolyglutamate hydrolase activity in the human gastrointestinal tract was investigated. The activity was demonstrated in gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and intestinal mucosa. The highest activity was found in the pancreatic juice with a pH-optimum of 4.5. In gastric juice the pH-optimum for the enzyme was 3 and the activity half of that found in pancreatic juice. However, in view of the volumes of these fluids produced every day, the activity at physiological pH might be enough to hydrolyse the daily intake of conjugated folates in amounts of about 500 mug.\n",
      "Erythroid differentiation of fetal, newborn and adult haemopoietic stem cells. Erythroid regeneration was studied in lethally irradiated mice given transplants containing equivalent numbers of haemopoietic stem cells (i.e. CFU) from fetal liver, neonatal marrow or adult marrow. Adult marrow was taken from normal control mice, whose CFU for the most part were not in active cell cycle, as well as from phenylhydrazine-treated groups whose CFU were in similar state of proliferation (i.e. approximately 40-50% in DNA SYNTHESIS) AS THOSE DERIVED FROM FETAL LIVER AND NEONATAL MARROW. Splenic and femoral radioiron (59Fe) incorporation were measured at intervals after transplantation and were found to begin earliest in mice given fetal liver, then in animals given neonatal marrow and latest in recipients of adult marrow. Peripheral reticulocytes showed a similar pattern of recovery. The data reported herein suggest that the differences in erythroid regeneration evoked by transplants of fetal liver, neonatal marrow or adult marrow, are not solely attributed to the degree of proliferation in the pluripotential stem cell compartment. These data may, however, suggest a shorter doubling time for cells comprising the fetal and newborn committed erythroid compartments.\n",
      "Serological types of Diplococcus pneumoniae isolated from the respiratory tract of children with cystic fibrosis and children with other diseases. The distribution of serological types of D. pneumoniae was investigated in 40 strains isolated from 26 children with cystic fibrosis and 57 strains isolated from 39 children with other diseases. All strains were isolated from sputum or tracheal secretion. The strains from cystic fibrosis patients belonged to 14 different serological types, the most prevalent were 19F, 19A and 3. The strains from the other group of children belonged to 20 different serological types, the most prevalent were 23F, 19F and 11A. The differences between the two groups of patients as to the prevalences of types were small, and it is concluded that no special serological types of D. pneumoniae are associated with cystic fibrosis.\n",
      "Catecholamine enzymes in the degenerative neurological disease idiopathic orthostatic hypotension. Discrete brain areas and sympathetic ganglia obtained at autopsy from patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension were assayed for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was decreased 7.5-fold in sympathetic ganglia, while tyrosine hydroxylase activity was reduced more than 50-fold in the pontine nucleus locus coeruleus. These observations indicate that noradrenergic neurons of both brain and ganglion are affected in idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, but suggest that the central and peripheral biochemical deficits differ.\n",

      "Theoretical considerations in the vector control of filariasis. In order to assist in assessing progress of vector control of filariasis a theoretical model is constructed, using retrospective data on infected persons removed to a vector-free situation. This shows that the decrease of microfilaraemia is not regular, but is gradual for the first 3 years and then more rapid, reaching zero at about 10 years. An estimate is made of the level to which the vector must be reduced before transmission of filariasis ceases, showing that the degree of efficiency required is considerably less than for malaria.\n",

      "Experimental stimulation of cell-mediated immunity without concomitant stimulation of humoral immunity in graft-versus-host immunosuppressed mice. The immunosuppressive effect of the graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction was studied in CBA X A F1 (CAF1) mice which had been rendered immunologically unresponsive by the injection of parental A strain lymphoid cells (GVH mice). Suppression of both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses was demonstrated by the prolonged survival of C57BL/6 (B6) skin allografts and by the inability of GVH mice to produce detectable antibody following stimulation with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). Appropriate stimulation of GVH mice induced cell-mediated immune reactions to xeno- and allogeneic antigens while the humoral immune responses to the same antigens remained suppressed. Multiple challenges of the GVH mice with B6 tissue caused a rapid rejection of subsequent B6 skin grafts but failed to stimulate the production of any detectable antibodies to B6 allotransplantation antigens. Sensitization of GVH mice with SRBC in Freund's complete adjuvant stimulated a delayed hypersensitivity response to SRBC, although no humoral response to SRBC could be detected, even after three challenges with SRBC. The experimental results are discussed in terms of a proposed model for GVH-induced immunosuppression.\n",

Investigations were carried out on the alkaline phosphatase in the sera of cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and chickens, the pH value of the buffer used being 9.0-9.8-10.0-10.2-10.6 and 11.0, and the method applied--that of Richterich. The pH value at which the serum alkaline phosphatase in the various farm animals and birds was most active was found to vary to a large extent. Optimal values for the enzyme's activity usually range as follows: cattle, 10.2; pigs and goats, 10.0; sheep,--10.2; horses,--9.8; chickens,--10.6.\n",
      "The electrolyte pattern of the gastric secretion from the vervet monkey. The output of acid, chloride, sodium and potassium in gastric washings from the Vervet monkey have been measured under basal conditions and while stimulating the secretion with two doses of pentagastrin (one dose submaximal, the other dose supramaximal). The output during washings with different weak electrolyte solutions (5 mEq/1 NaC1, KCl, or HCl or 0.36 M Glycine) are compared. The results show that the composition of the secretion was independent of the composition of the rinsing fluid in the stomach except that glycine stimulated acid and potassium secretion when the monkey was not stimulated by pentagastrin. These observations and the composition of the gastric secretion of the Vervet monkey are discussed in the light of the \"two-component\" and \"exchange\" models of gastric secretion, and which compared with the gastric juice obtained from humans under similar conditions.\n",

The diagnostic specificity of a new method to detect obstructive jaundice by determination of lipoprotein X (LP-X) was tested in 144 patients with different kinds of hepatic diseases and compared with the usual chemical \"obstructive jaundice specific\" tests, such as bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, LAP and gamma-GT. The LP-X test was performed by using all-in test kit LP-X Rapidophor\" low-voltage electrophoresis of Immuno AG/Wien. The results were correlated with the histological classification of the liver biopsy specimen. In 82% of the histologically verified cases of obstructive jaundice the result of the LP-X test was positive, whilst in 98.5% of the histologically negative cases the result of the LP-X test was negative. Hence, this LP-X method proved superior to chemical methods in providing a clear-cut positive or negative answer to the presence of cholestasis. Furthermore, the LP-X test was suitable for long-term follow-up investigation of patients with obstructive jaundice.\n",

      "[Immunosuppressive therapy in renal disease (author's transl)]. Since immunological events were found to be pathogenetically involved in various forms of glomerulonephritis, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs were introduced in the treatment of nephritis. However, as opposed to the findings in the paediatric nephrotic syndrome, controlled and multicentric trials with immunosuppressive therapy revealed disappointing results in the management of renal disease in adults. Significantly better results under immunosuppressive therapy, were seen only in the nephrotic syndrome based on the so-called \"no changes\" or \"minimal changes\" nephritis. In chronic membranous and proliferative glomerulonephritis the clinical course in the treated group was not statistically different from that of the untreated group. In some disorders of connective tissues, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa and Wegener's granulomatosis, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents seem to exert a favourable effect on the course of renal disease. Encouraging results concerning the combined use of immunosuppressive drugs, anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in mesangiocapillary (membrano-proliferative) glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive nephritis have also been presented. Several factors such as incomplete immunosuppression, druginduced antigen tolerance and increased immune complex formation as a consequence of inhibited antibody production may contribute to the fact that many patients with different forms of nephritis do not benefit from long-term immunosuppressive therapy.\n",

On the basis of reports in the literature and of our own clinical experience it appears that melanocyte inhibiting factor (MIF) is a very promising therapeutic agent in the management of Parkinson's disease. Besides theoretical considerations relating to biochemical and pathophysiological spheres, the question of the current dosage for clinical usage seems to be of the utmost importance. We are of the opinion that the currently-employed dosage of 400 mg daily is still too low. Hence, the present investigation will be continued with a view to establishing the optimum dosage for maximal therapeutic effect.\n",
      "Implication of rifampicin-quinone in the irreversible binding of rifampicin to macromolecules. 1. When [3H]rifampicin is incubated with rat liver microsomes or rat liver homogenate, minor amounts are bound irreversibly to protein. This effect does not depend on the presence of NAD, NADH, NADP or NADPH. 2. Rifampicin is autoxidized at physiological pH. The product of autoxidation, rifampicin-quinone, if incubated with albumin, shows a much greater irreversible binding to the protein than the parent compound rifampicin. Hence it is concluded that rifampicin may bind irreversibly to proteins in a non-enzymic reaction after autoxidation to rifampicin-quinone. 3. Rifampicin-quinone also binds irreversibly to RNA and poly-L-lysine, if incubated with these compounds. This suggests that free amino groups of protein or RNA are involved in the binding. 4. 48 h after dosage of [3H]rifampicin (33 mg/kg) to rats, 29-2 +/- 4-1 (S.D.) pmol are bound irreversibly to 1 mg liver RNA, 15.8 +/- 8-1 pmol to 1 mg liver protein and 5-0 +/- 0-47 pmol to 1 mg protein in brain tissue. 5. Microsomal NADPH-cytochromcin-quinone to rifampicin. The KM of this reaction is 10(-4) M. Induction of the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase by pre-treatment of rats with 20 mg/kg rifampicin over 5 days results in a corresponding increase of increase of rifampicin-quinone reduction. 6.

      "On the mechanism of the acridine orange sensitized photodynamic inactivation of lysozyme. I. Basic kinetics. The kinetics of the photodynamic desactivation of lysozyme in presence of acridine orange as the sensitizer have been investigated in detail varying oxygen, protein, dye concentration, ionic strength and pH value. The kinetics can be approximately described as an over all pseudo-first-order rate process. Changing the solvent from water to D2O or by quenching experiments in presence of azide ions it could be shown that the desactivation of lysozyme is caused exclusively by singlet oxygen. The excited oxygen occurs via the triplet state of the dye with a rate constant considerably lower than that to be expected for a diffusionally controlled reaction. Singlet oxygen react chemically (desactivation, k=2.9 X 10(7) m(-1) sec(-1)) and physically (quenching process, k=4.1 X 10(8) m(-1) sec(-1)) with the enzyme. The kinetical analysis shows that additional chemical reaction between singlet oxygen and lysozyme would have only little influence on the kinetics of the desactivation as long as their products would be enzymatically active and their kinetical constants would be less than about 1 X 10(8) m(-1) sec(-1)).\n",
      "Photoreactions of cytochrome b6 and cytochrome f in chloroplast photosystem I fragments. Photosystem I fragments were prepared by digitonin treatment of spinach chloroplasts. The midpoint potential of cytochrome b6 in the fragments is close to 0V, showing a one electron transition. No cytochrome b559 was detectable, neither in difference absorption spectra nor in light-induced absorbance changes. In the absence of added cofactors only cytochrome b6 photoreduction can be observed. This photoreduction is stimulated by ferredoxin. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase appears not to be involved in cytochrome b6 reduction. Photooxidation of cytochrome b6 is dependent on plastocyanin addition and inhibited by DBMIB, a plastoquinone antagonist. Addition of plastocyanin restores cytochrome f photooxidation as well, reacting quite specifically in about equimolar concentrations to bound cytochrome f. The stimulation of cytochrome f oxidation is abolished by an antibody prepared against plastocyanin, indicating a surface location of plastocyanin in digitonin treated membranes. Biphasic kinetics of dark-reduction of cytochrome f by ascorbate indicate that part of this cytochrome f is relatively inaccessible in the membrane. After preillumination a monophasic reduction is observed and the slowly oxidized component is absent. Illumination in the presence of plastocyanin causes a fast and complete reduction of cytochrome f, suggesting equilibration of cytochrome f with added plastocyanin, residing in the membrane surface. It appears that actinic light causes conformation and/or structural changes in the membrane of these digitonin fragments, influencing cytochrome f asseccibility.\n",
      "[Extraction and concentration of Clostridium botulinum toxins from specimens (author's transl)]. In order to detect minimal amounts of Clostridium botulinum toxins in animal tissue or food specimens it is necessary to use an extraction method which results in concentration of the botulinal toxins. In the present examinations, artificially contaminated canned beans were used to develop a suitable procedure for extraction and concentration of botulinal toxins A-E. The procedure consisted of 4 steps: 1. Canned beans were diluted 1:2 with 0.1 m phosphate buffer pH 6.0. 2. The diluted material was homogenised with an \"Ultra-Turrax\" homogeniser for 20 sec. 3. The monogenised material was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min. 4. 15 ml of supernatant was concentrated using a \"Millipore ultrafiltration chamber\" (with a membrane capable of excluding all material with a molecular weight above 25,000). A pressure of 1.5 atmospheres was applied until the terminal volume was 0.5 ml. Following extraction and concentration, the samples were assayed for botulinal toxin in mice. Using this assay the concentration of the five toxins were shown to be as follows: Type A toxin: 19.0-fold toxin concentration Type B toxin: 14.8-fold toxin concentration Type C toxin: 20.6-fold toxin concentration Type D toxin: 28.2-fold toxin concentration Type E toxin: 112.2-fold toxin concentration\n",
      "Bacterial meningitis in infancy and childhood in Lusaka (One year prospective sturdy). In approximately 10,000 admissions in a 12 months period, at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka 85 cases of meningitis were recorded. The signs and symptoms in these patients do not greatly differ from other similar studies in Africa. The commonest organism isolated was pneumococcus. There was high mortality rate which was to a large extent due to parents not bringing their children to hospital early enough for medical treatment to be instituted. This is borne out by the fact that 50% of the children with meningitis died within the first 24 hours. The C.S.F. protein and peripheral white blood count may be of prognostic value. Spasticity, cranial nerve palsises hydrocephalus and subdural effusion were the commonest complications.\n",
      "Cerebral blood flow and exchange of oxygen, glucose, ketone bodies, lactate, pyruvate and amino acids in infants. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral av-differences of oxygen and circulating substrates were measured in normocapnic infants during general anaesthesia before elective surgery in order to study possible age-dependent variations. CBF was determined by a minor modification of the Kety-Schmidt technique from desaturation curves of nitrous oxide (N2O) in arterial and cerebral venous blood (N2O analysed by gas chromatography on 15 mul blood samples) after reduction of inhaled N2O from 75 to 50%. The reproducibility was +/-4.6%. Lactate, pyruvate and oxygen were determined in whole blood and amino acids in plasma by ion-exchange chromatography. Reliable av-differences of glucose, acetoacetate and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate could be calculated from plasma values and hematocrits. Mean values from 12 infants (age 11 days-12 months) were: CBF 69 ml/100 g0min-1; cerebral uptake (in mumoles/100 g-min-1): oxygen 104, glucose 27, acetoacetate 0.9, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate 2.3; cerebral release: lactate 2.4 and pyruvate 0.8. Significant uptake of amino acids was found only for histidine 0.95 and arginine 0.7. Significant correlations between arterial concentration and cerebral exchange were found for: ornithine, arginine, phenylalanine, aspartic acid, serine, glutamine and acetoacetate. CBF and substrate exchange were unrelated to age within the group. Infants had higher mean CBF and greater uptake of ketone bodies than has been reported in adults.\n",
      "Down's syndrome with X0/XY mosaicism. A 5-month-old Chinese infant with combined Down's syndrome and X0/XY mosaicism is presented. The phenotypical features of mongolism are classical and unmodified. The somatic effects of X0/XY mosaicism is that of incomplete masculinization with short phallus, hypospadias, bifid scrotum, urogenital sinus, and bilateral extra-abdominal infantile testicles. These features together with the absence of internal female organs and signs of Turner's syndrome in this patient are different from the previous reported cases of mixed gonadal dysgenesis.\n",
      "Bile canalicular alkaline phosphatase and disease. The alkaline phosphatase reaction is normally absent in human bile canaliculi, but was found in 79 patients. In search for a common causal factor, these patients were further examined. Thirty-seven were autopsied. The conditions most ocmmonly associated with the phenomenon were malignant tumours with or without involvement of the liver, collagen diseases, long-standing partial obstruction of the common bile duct, and genetic variants of alpha-1-antitrypsin. No clinical or laboratory facts were common to all the patients.\n",
      "Polyarteritis nodosa associated with nosematosis in blue foxes. The patho-morphological lesions in fox nosematosis (encephalitozoonosis) were studied in a material comprising 150 young blue foxes from 23 different farms. Disseminated nosematosis in blue fox pups was regularly accompanied by severe vasculitis, affecting medium-sized and small arteries in various organs. The acute damage has the form of a necrotizing angiitis, with mural necrosis and sometimes resultant thrombosis. The causative organism Nosema cuniculi, is frequently present in the freshly affected arterial walls, either in endothelial or in medial smooth muscle cells. Older lesions include nodular fibrous thickening of the arterial walls, and intimal proliferation, sometimes with luminal obliteration. The conclusion is drawn that the arterial lesions are morphologically equivalent to classical polyarteritis nodosa.\n",
      "Some factors influencing the haemolysis of Bordetella bronchiseptica. Strain-dependent variations in the ability of Bordetella bronchiseptica to produce haemolysis on solid media exist. Haemolysis is strongest at an acid reaction and will not take place if the reaction is too alkaline. Peptone and glutamine inhibit haemolysis and favour growth. The vigorous growth rapidly produced an alkaline reaction which inhibits the haemolysis.\n",
      "[Effects of acid-base changes upon the chronotropic response to norepinephrine (author's transl)]. The effect of changes in pH produced by changing NaHCO2 at constant pCO2 and by changing pCO2 at constant NaHCO2 concentration was studied in the spontaneous beating rat atrium. Alkalosis produced either by changes in pCO2 or in NaHCO2 concentration increased basal heart rate shifting dose-response curves to norepinephrine upwards. When these dose-response curves were analysed for a horizontal shift, it was found that the necessary dose to produce a given effect was lesser in alkalosis than in acidosis. This shift was significant at the ED10 and at ED30 when the pCO2 was lowered and at ED30, ED50 and ED70 when the NaHCO2 concentration was increased. Beta-adrenergic blockade did not prevent the rate increasing effect of alkalosis. Our results suggest that there is a sensitizing effect to norepinephrine in alkalosis superimposed to a direct effect of pH upon heart rate.\n",
      "Blood changes in water deprived rats. To study the variations of blood constituents during water deprivation, rats were deprived of water from six to twelve days. Control and rehydrated animals were also included in the study. A significant increase was observed in sodium, chloride and hematocrit throughout the experiment. Calcium, bicarbonate and PCO2 increased at 10-11 days of treatment. Potassium, inorganic phosphorus, pH, base excess and blood buffer capacity did not change in the course of the experiment. Rehydrated animals recovered to control levels in all the studied components, except for pH and base excess, which increased somewhat. Plasma volume changes could explain only partially electrolyte variation. The \"dehydration reaction\" is considered to be the main mechanism responsible for these changes. Unchanged hematocrit levels in water deprived animals suggest that after 6 days of water deprivation there is no further loss of plasma water. Bicarbonate and PCO2 changes showed a good relationship and may account for unchanged pH and base excess values.\n",
      "Effect of ultraviolet radiation on pinocytosis in Amoeba proteua. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (4 000-10 000 erg X mm(-2) decreased membrane potential and input resistance of Amoeba proteus and induced formation of pinocytotic channels. Submaximal pinocytosis induced by UV light was additive to pinocytosis induced by K+ or Na+ and stimulated in the presence of EGTA. It was not inhibited by the presence of La+++ or by pretreatment with dibucaine. In these respects and with respect to optimum pH and pCa, UV induced pinocytosis. Accumulation of K+ in the amoeba membrane after a dose of radiation may explain the similarity between pinocytosis induced by UV light and potassium salts. Ca++ present during the period of irradiation inhibited the effect of UV light. Instead Ca++ applied after irradiation (1-20 mM) increased channel formation. This effect was stimulated the presence of local anesthetic drugs. It is suggested that high doses of UV light may induce channel formation by releasing Ca++ from the cell membrane into the cell (UV induced pinocytosis). Ca++ may be released at the moment of absorption of UV light in the membrane as well as during the period of depolarization which follows irradiation. Low doses of UV light may permit extracellular Ca++ to enter the cell and stimulate channel formation (calcium induced pinocytosis). Dithiotreitol (1 mM) applied after irradiation depressed both UV and calcium induced pinocytosis so these may be the result of the same structural change which involves the formation of disulphide bonds in the membrane.\n",
      "An in vitro-formed protamine-heparin complex as a model for a two-compartment store for biogenic amines. The capacity of an in vitro-formed protamine-heparin complex (PHC) to store inorganic cations and biogenic amines was investigated. The PHC behaves like a two-compartment storage system. One compartment corresponds to the terminal free carboxyl groups of the protamine moiety and has the characteristics of a cation exchanger, with the ability to bind inorganic cations and biogenic amines in a reversible and rather unslective manner. The cations and biogenic amines therefore compete for and displace each other from the common ionic binding sites. The binding sites in the other compartment, corresponding mainly to the carboxyl groups of the heparin moiety, are only unmasked at high ionic concentrations and show a specific affinity for biogenic amines. The storage of amines in this compartment of the PHC is reversible but is dependent not only on simple ionic binding but evidently also on other attractive forces, such as dipole and hydrogen bonding.\n",
      "The local effect of pH changes in the cerebrospinal fluid on the ventrolateral areas of medulla oblongata and on the spinal cord surface on the activity of cardiac and vertebral sympathetic nerves. Application of acid cerebrospinal fluid at pH 6.8 to the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata in cats increased the arterial blood pressure and the activity of the vertebral nerve and enhanced respiratory modulation of the vertebral and cardiac nerves. Alkaline cerebrospinal fluid at pH 7.7 applied to the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata increased the arterial blood pressure without changes in the sympathetic nerve activity. When the spinal cord was superfussed with artificial acid cerebrospinal fluid at the Th1 level the activity of the vertebral nerve and cardiac nerve increased and the arterial blood pressure rose. The authors discuss the possibility of regulation of the activity of sympathetic neurons in the medulla and spinal cord by means of direct action of pH and pCO2 on the neurons, or through an indirect effect mediated by superficial chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata. The role of local changes of the brain blood flow in the mechanism of these results is discussed as well.\n",
      "Oxygen uptake and tissue oxygen tension during adrenergic stimulation in canine subcutaneous adipose tissue. The effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation (NS) and injected noradenaline (NA) or isoprenaline (Iso) on PVO2, VO2 and PtO2 was studied in isolated canine subcutaneous adipose tissue. These effects were compared to those produced by mechanical blood flow reduction (clamping). Resting VO2 measured 13.0+/- 2.3 mumol X min-1 X 100 g-1. When blood flow was reduced by 20% or less there was no significant change of VO2. Reducing blood flow to 50% of control or less by NS caused a parallel reduction in VO2, while clamping reduced VO2 significantly less. NA gave effects similar to those of NS. After NS or NA there was a period of hyperemia and increased oxygen extraction which more than compensated for the decrease in VO2 during vasoconstriction. Such a net increase in VO2 was not produced by clamping. Control PtO2 averaged 29+/-2 mmHg. NA reduced it by 70% and clamping to the same blood flow level only by 14% (p less than 0.01). Thus, a mere reduction in blood flow has little effect on PtO2, while blood flow reduction combined with redistribution of blood flow and an increased oxygen deman can lead to tissue hypoxia.\n",
      "Beta2-adrenoceptors facilitating noradrenaline secretion from human vasoconstrictor nerves. Isolated biopsy specimens of human peripheral arteries and veins, preincubated with 3H-(-)- noradrenaline (NA) to label the neural stores of NA, were used to study the Beta-adrenoceptors previously found to increase the secretion of 3H-NA evoked by electrical field stimulation of the adrenergic nerves of this tissue. The increase in nerve stimulation induced secretion of 3H-NA caused by 0.04 muM isoprenaline was prevented by 1 muM propranolol. This beta-blocking drug by itself slightly but significantly depressed the secretion of 3H-NA caused by nerve stimulation in the absence of isoprenaline. While the secretion of 3H-NA was not affected by known beta1-agonists, it was dose-dependently and reversibly increased by two different beta2-agonists. The effect of isoprenaline on 3H-NA secretion was not altered by a selective beta1-antagonist, but strongly reduced or abolished by a beta2-blocking drug. The results indicate that the beta-adrenoceptors involved in the control of NA secretion from the vasoconstrictor nerves of human omental blood vessels are only to a minimal extent stimulated by NA secreted from the nerves, and therefore do probably not mainly serve to mediate local positive feedback control of transmitter secretion; the receptors appear to be beta2 in nature.\n",
      "Vagal reflexes in the bronchoconstriction occurring after induced intravascular platelet aggregation. Intravascular platelet aggregation induced in cats by i.v. infusions of collagen caused a transient increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and in non-elastic pulmonary resistance (RL), and a transient decrease in dynamic lung compliance (dyn CL). PVR,dyn CL and platelet aggregation after collagen infusions were unaffected by bilateral cervical vagotomy and atropinization, wheras these procedures reduced the post-infusion rise in RL by about 50 per cent. The administration of indomethacin inhibited platelet aggregation as well as bronchoconstriction after collagen infusion. The present investigation indicates that intravascular platelet aggregation will cause reflex bronchoconstriction mediated by vagal efferent fibres.\n",
      "Clinical features in poisonings by tricyclic antidepressants with special reference to the ECG. Clinical variables, and especially their relation to the ECG, have been studied in 153 cases of poisonings by tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). The mean age of the patients was 34 years. Amitriptyline poisoning accounted for 112 (73%) of the cases and the mean dose ingested was about 1 000 mg. Coma was present in 87 patients (57%) and on admission 40 (26%) had a systolic blood pressure (BP) below 100 mmHg. The systolic BP on admission was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) and the heart rate (HR) higher (p less than 0.001) than when the patients left the ward. Apart from an increased HR (greater than or equal to 90 beats/min), which was present in 73% of the cases, the most characteristic ECG change was a QRS prolongation (greater than or equal to 0.11 sec), this being found in 42% of the cases. About the same proportion displayed a QT prolongation and 28% had a prolonged PQ time. The mean of the QRS times was 0.11 sec. Unlike the QT time, the QRS time was not correlated to HR. Statistical analysis of the material with regard to clinical variables (dose of TCA, BP, coma duration, etc.) showed that the QRS time was closely related to the severity of poisoning. Five patients (3) died, all of whom already on admission demonstrated advanced ECG changes with arrhythmias and a mean QRS time of 0.19 sec. Excluding dibenzepine poisonings (4 cases, all fatal), the mortality rate was 0.7%. The importance of high initial preparedness for cardiac complications is pointed out, as is the value of the QRS time as a guide to the severity of poisoning.\n",
      "The mechanism of action of glycosidases. The factors that may contribute to the rate enhancement observed with enzymatic versus non-enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosides are discussed. The nature of the active site as deduced from labelling studies with beta-glucosidases is described. A two-step mechanism involving either an enzyme stabilized glycosyl ion or a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is proposed. Experiments with a beta-glucosidase from almonds show that even with 2-deoxy glucosides with good leaving groups as aglycon which are hydrolyzed 1000 times more slowly than the corresponding glucosides, the deglucosylation step is faster than the cleavage of the glycosidic bond.\n",
      "Properties of hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase isolated from yeast. Yeasts can advantageously be utilized for the production of the 17beta-hydroxy-derivative, from 3-methoxy-8,14-seco-1,3,5(10),9(11)-estratetraene-14,17-dione (14,17-dione) while 14alpha-hydroxy and 14alpha,17beta-dihydroxy-derivatives are also formed. The biochemical properties of yeasts' enzymes responsible for the formation of the two monohydroxy-derivatives have been studied in detail. In the cell-free extract of Saccharomyces the presence of two hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases could be detected. The first enzyme forms 3beta,17beta-dihydroxy-derivative from 5alpha-androstane-317-dione. This enzyme is responsible for the formation of 17beta-hydroxy-derivative from 14,17-dione. The second enzyme forms 3alpha-hydroxy-derivative from 5beta-androstanedione as well as 14alpha-hydroxy-derivative from its 14,17-dione. The cofactor of both enzymes is pyridine nucleotide. The two enzymes possessing different properties can selectively be inhibited.\n",
      "Properties of delta5-3beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase isolated from Streptomyces griseocarneus. Delta5-3beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase was extracted in magnesium-containing Tris buffer from sonicated Streptomyces griseocarneus cells. The enzyme was partially purified (150 X) by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration following (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Upon gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 to G-200, the greatest part of the activity gave a peak in the fractionation range. The enzyme obtained from the gel yielded small enzyme molecules on repeated chromatography. A molecular weight of 32 to 36 000 was calculated for the activity appearing in the fractionation range of Sephadex G-75 to G-200. The enzyme is highly specific for the irreversible oxidation of the 3beta-hydroxyl group in steroids with a trans-anellated A : B ring system with either C5 or C6 double bond. Delta5-3-ketosteroids are converted into delta5-3-ketosteroids at a high rate, but the isomerase activity cannot be separated from the oxidoreductase activity either by chromatography or by selective heat inactivation. NAD, NADP, FMN or FAD did not influence the activity, but the enzyme is inactive in the absence of molecular oxygen.\n",
      "Soil microflora of the rhizosphere of plants from several habitats in the botanical garden in Poznań. The abundance and activity of certain groups of soil microorganisms were estimated in the rhizosphere of 13 plants from four different habitats at several dates. An additional study was made of the rhizosphere microflora of Ledum palustre from a peat-bog. Numbers of proteolytic, nitrate assimilating, denitrifying, and cellulolytic bacteria were estimated. The intensity of ammonification, nitrification and Clostridium growth was estimated. The studies have revealed that the abundance and the activity of all the groups of bacteria studied depended on the habitat. Within one habitat, however, the influence of the plant was sometimes more pronounced than that of the habitat itself, particularly on the abundance of proteolytic bacteria (Fig. 1). The date of sampling had very little effect on the abundance of all the bacterial groups studied except the cellulolytic bacteria.\n",
      "Kinetic studies on citric acid production by Aspergillus niger. II. The two-stage process. A two-stage process of submerged citric acid fermentation with replacement of growth medium by fermentation medium has been worked out. The optimum composition of mineral nutrients and pH of the fermentation medium of the second stage of the process were determined. An addition of 0.5 g/l of NH4NO3 as nitrogen source and 0.1 g/l of MgSO4-7H2O as magnesium source ensured effective conversion of sucrose to citric acid. An addition to KH2PO4, on the other hand, was definitely unfavourable as it considerably reduced the product yield. The medium for the second stage of fermentation should be acidified to about pH 2.2, while the water used for washing the mycelium from the remains of the growth medium should have a pH of 2.5--3.5. Under these conditions, with an initial sucrose concentration of 100 g/l, after 132 hr fermentation at 26 degrees up to 90 g/l of citric acid was obtained, which corresponds to a productivity of over 16 g/l. day. The highest activity for citric acid formation was found in three- or four-day-old mycelium.\n",
      "L-Glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase in Lactobacillus plantarum. Glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase which mediates the reaction of glyoxylic acid with glutamic acid to yield glycine and alpha-oxoglutaric acid has been isolated and purified 84-fold from extracts of Lactobacillus plantarum. Purified enzyme requires the addition of pyridoxal phosphate and magnesium ions for its activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme estimated by Sepharose 4B gel filtration amounts to 37.000. Micaelis constants for glyoxylate and glutamate are corresponding to 6.25 X 10(-3) M and 2.75 X 10(-3) M, respectively. Optimal pH in phosphate and veronal buffers is 8.0 and optimal temperature 35--37 degrees C.\n",
      "Inhibition of Newcastle disease virus replication by 6-azauridine. II. Combination of 6-azauridine and adenine derivatives. Twenty-five metabolites (purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides and nucleosides) were tested for their simultaneous action with 6-azauridine (AzUrd) in inhibition of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication. With the exception of deoxyadenosine and cyclic AMP all natural adenine derivatives exerted a synergic effect with AzUrd like ATP. Glutamine in combination with AzUrd did not inhibit NDV replication. The inhibitory effect of the combination of AzUrd and adenine derivatives was reversible by guanosine, uridine and cytidine but not by orotic acid or orotidylic acid.\n",
      "Some biological activities of rabbit anti-interferon serum. After prolonged immunization of rabbits with a semipurified mouse interferon preparation in Freund's incomplete or Al-Span-Oil adjuvant, a specific interferon-neutralizing immunoglobulin was obtained from antiserum with a capacity of neutralizing about 49000 mouse interferon units per ml. The specific activity of the antiserum and immunoglobulin was confirmed in tests in which the interaction of antibodies with the cell surface was ruled out. The antiserum (and the immunoglobulin) neutralized both the antiviral and the cell-growth inhibitory activities of interferon. The \"slow\" and the \"fast\" fractions of purified interferon preparations were equally sensitive to the neutralizing effect of antibodies. On the other hand, the reaction of heat-inactivated interferon with the antiserum did not diminish the neutralizing activity of the latter, suggesting a destruction of interferon antigenic sites.\n",
      "Interferon-producing capacity of human tonsil cells and properties of interferon produced by these cells. Tonsils excised from human beings for chronic tonsillitis have been shown to be an accessible and sufficiently rich source of human lymphocytes. Tonsil cells produced interferon as intensively as blood leukocytes and the properties of this interferon were similar to those of leukocyte interferon. The optimal conditions for interferon production by tonsil cells were established.\n",
      "Diminished virucidal activity of kethoxal against vesicular stomatitis virus pretreated with guanidinating reagent and proteases. The reactivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with kethoxal can be appreciably altered by treatment with 1-guanyl-3, 5-dimethyl pyrazole nitrate (GDMP) and proteolytic enzymes. Pretreatment of purified VSV with GDMP or proteolytic enzymes markedly reduced the effectiveness of kethoxal as a virucide. The rate of neutralizability of GDMP- and trypsin-treated viruses by specific antiserum differed from that of controls.\n",
      "Levels of immunoglobulins and antibodies to haemaglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza virus in nasal secretions after natural infection. Nasal washings (NW) from 16 influenza patients in the course of an epidemic in November and December, 1974 were examined for the presence of influenza virus, immunoglobulins (Ig) and titres of haemagglutination inhibiting (HI) and neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibodies. Influenza virus identical with A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2), increased levels of IgA and occasionally IgG, and specific antibodies were detected in the NW. The dynamics of HI and NI antibody formation did not differ substantially, but there were individual differences in titres and persistence of antibodies. Convalescent sera always contained increased levels of HI and NI antibodies. In some cases, the titres of antibody to viral ribonucleoprotein did not increase.\n",
      "Associated seroconversions to respiratory viruses in volunteers with experimental influenza infection. Serological examinations of 573 volunteers with mild experimental influenza infection and 86 volunteers of a control group hospitalized in a special clinic revealed a significant rise in the titre of antibodies (seroconversion) not only to influenza A or B viruses used for the experimental infection but in 23.3 to 29.8% of cases also to other respiratory viruses. Based on a number of arguments, associated seroconversions are interpreted as due to mixed or sequential infections of different aetiology.\n",
      "Different allotypic susceptibility of mice to Rickett-sia tsutsugamushi. Some lines of mice and random-bred mice show different susceptibility to infection with Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, displayed mainly in the development of overt infection. The latter is most markedly manifested in random-bred and Swiss mice, causing high death rates and massive accumulation of rickettsiae in the peritoneum. Black mice respond to inoculation with asymptomatic infection with no microscopically detectable rickettsiae. The infection is accompanied in either case by immunological response and persistence of the agent in mice. One of the mechanisms of resistance to R. tsutsugamushi in some mouse lines is due to phagocytosis at the inoculation site of the main mass of rickettsiae by macrophages which digest the agent and retain their viability.\n",
      "Cytological investigation of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi infection of mice with different allotypic susceptibility to the agent. Cytological and cytochemical studies on Swiss and random-bred white mice susceptible to Rickettsia tsutsugamushi infection as well as resistant C57 Black 6 and CBA mice revealed a clear-cut relationship between the severity of infection and the pattern of macrophage reaction. In highly susceptible mice the fatal infection was accompanied by death of macrophages and necrotisation of the peritoneal exudate cells. The resistant mice showed no clinical signs but developed an intensive macrophage reaction, and the main mass of the inoculated rickettsiae died at the inoculation site, the macrophages remaining viable. Phagocytosis and digestion of rickettsiae were accompanied by markedly increased activities of hydrolytic and oxidizing-reducing enzymes.\n",

Approximate localisation of the virus particles in the cells was possible.\n",
      "Interferon pretreatment primes interferon production by human adenovirus in chick embryo cells. Pretreatment of chick embryo cells (CEC) with homologous interferon enhanced the subsequent interferon production induced by human adenovirus.

      "Enhancement of interferon induction in mice by polycationic modified polypeptides. Combined intraperitoneal treatment of mice with poly I: C and a polycationic modified polypeptide (poly-DMAE-glutamine) was investigated. It was established that the presence of appropriate amounts of poly-DMAE-glutamine produced markedly enhanced serum interferon levels as compared to those produced by poly I: C alone. Similar combinations injected into mice produced full protection against lethal doses of mouse-virulent Semliki forest virus.\n",
      "Inhibition of Newcastle disease virus replication by 6-azauridine. I. Inefficacy of purified uridine kinase, effect of adenosine-5'-triphosphate. As distinct from cell-free extracts prepared from tumour cells, partially purified uridine kinase prepared from the same cells was not effective in 6-azauridine (AzUrd) inhibition of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication. This showed that uridine kinase was not the effective component of cell-free extracts. Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was found to exert a synergic effect in combination with AzUrd in the inhibition of NDV replication.\n",
      "Effect of vagus nerve stimulation upon excitability of the canine ventricle. Role of sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions. The effect of vagus nerve stimulation on ventricular excitability was studied in 28 dogs under various conditions of adrenergic neural tone. Strength-interval curves were delineated from the apex of the right ventricular endocardium with a transvenous bipolar catheter. Vagus nerve stimulation in both closed chest and open chest dogs shifted the strength-interval curve 6 to 8 msec later into electrical diastole (P less than 0.001). Left stellate ganglion stimulation shifted the strength-interval curve 9 to 11 msec earlier into diastole (P less than 0.001). The effect of simultaneous left stellate ganglion and vagus nerve stimulation was not significantly different from that of left stellate ganglion stimulation alone. The influence of vagus nerve stimulation on the strength-interval curve under basal conditions was abolished by acute beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol. It is concluded that vagus nerve stimulation affects ventricular excitability as well as vulnerability by opposing the effects of sympathetic neural tone.\n",
      "An automated flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent glutathione reductase assay for assessing riboflavin nutriture. An automated AutoAnalyzer method using 5:5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid is described for determining whole blood glutathione reductase (BGR) activity and for measuring in vitro activation of BGR with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). BGR activity is expressed as mumoles glutathione regenerated from oxidized glutathione per ml of whole blood (WB) or per g of hemoglobin. The stimulatory effect of FAD on BGR activity divided by the activity without FAD determined the activity coefficient (AC). We found that NADPH and oxidized glutathione assay concentrations of 0.100 mmole/liter and 0.250 mmole/liter, respectively, in 0.1 mole/liter phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, gave consistent results when WB, before assay, was diluted 20-fold. WB samples to be stored are initially diluted 10-fold with distilled water and frozen. Prior to assay, two aliquots of the sample are diluted 2-fold, one aliquot with distilled water and another with 46 mumole/liter FAD. With sample and manifold dilutions the assay FAD concentrations is 1.0 mumole/liter: assay concentrations greater than 5.0 mumole FAD/liter were shown to be inhibitory. We examined blood samples from 617 children in the age range 6 to 60 months and determined the normal AC range to be between 1.00 and 1.35. Six weaned rats (23 days of age), maintained on a riboflavin-deficient diet, showed a mean AC of 1.23, 1.54, 2.02, and 2.41 at 23, 26, 30, and 36 days of age, respectively. Six control rats maintained an AC of 1.23 +/- 0.05 (SD) during the same period.\n",
      "Accidental poisoning with psychotropic drugs in children. Seventy-seven (0.24%) of 32,005 admissions to the Massachusetts General Hospital pediatric service during the period 1962 to 1973 were due to accidental poisoning. In 27 cases, mostly involving children less than 6 years of age, psychotropic drugs were implicated. These included sedative-hypnotics in six cases, phenytoin in two, major tranquilizers in five, antidepressants in three, stimulants or hallucinogens in three, and drug mixtures in eight. Toxicologic analyses contributed little to diagnosis and initial management. Except for one child who ingested ferrous sulfate, no patient was seriously intoxicated, and all recovered rapidly without sequelae. Although referral of serious poisoning cases to another hospital may have biased the results, the findings suggest that accidental psychotropic drug poisoning is not a major source of childhood morbidity.\n",
      "[Mediators of the allergic reaction. Slow reacting substance (SRS-A)]. The slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) belongs to a group of substances which produce a slow progressive and sustained contraction of some smooth muscles. It is released by the interaction of the antigen with certain antibodies; in humans through the interaction with the IgE or reagine. The SRS-A is a heat-labile sustance, chemically unstable, of an acid character, with a low molecular weight. It is not destroyed by the action of proteolytic enzymes. Its molecular structure has not yet been elucidated. It is not found accumulated in the cells but synthesized and released by some white cells mainly by sensitized mast cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes after challenging with the specific antigen. The SRS-A is a powerful pharmacodynamic agent, it produces contraction of the bronchial smooth muscle in doses of nanograms. It probably plays a predominant role in the physiopathology of asthma. The chain of chemical reactions elicited by antigen-antibody interaction does not end with the release of SRS-A and the other mediators (histamine, eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, ECF-A), on the contrary, these mediators especially SRS-A induce the release of prostaglandins of type E (PGE1 and PGE2) which produce bronchodilatation and inhibit the release of SRS-A itself, perhaps being a selfregulating mechanism. The PGF2a, on the other hand, produces bronchoconstriction. The release of SRS-A is also inhibited by the action of diethyl-carbamazine and especially by sodium chromoglicate and compound AH-7725. From the biochemical point of view it is found that the antigen Igells, a serine esterase, initiating several chemical reactions whose consequence is a decrease in the cAMP concentration. This reduction in the cAMP intracellular level is followed by synthesis and excretion of the SRS-A as well as by the aggregation of the microtubules and excretion of the stored histamine. The PGE (1 and 2) acting on one type of membrane receptor and the beta-agonist catecholamines on another produce a common phenomenon: the activation of the adenylcyclase whcih produces the increase of the concentration of cAMP and inhibits the release of mediators of the anapylactic reaction. The parasympathetic system through its chemical mediator acethylcholine, by a mechanism in whcih adenycyclase is not involved is also capable of stimulating the release of histamine and SRS-A. Something similar happens with PGF2a. In conclusion, self-regulatory mechansims for the release of mediators of the anaphylactic reactions may exist. The \"perpetuation\" of an asthamtic reaction would signify a failure of these self-regulatory mechanisms due to, for example, to a temporary block of the beta-adrenergic receptors, overstimulation of the alfa-receptors or insufficient production of PGE or a transformation of the PGE in PGF.\n",
      "Polyarteritis in children. Polyarteritis was diagnosed in three girls, 9 to 10 years old, by kidney and skin biopsies. They were treated with a combination of prednisone (1.5 to 2 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg) for up to 12 months. The illness was severe in all three, complicated by hypertension, seizures, pulmonary infiltrates, renal failure, or hallucinations. All three patients are alive and well with no or minimal residual symptoms two to three years after therapy was discontinued. The treatment with corticosteroids or with a combination of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs seems to improve the prognosis of polyarteritis considerably.\n",
      "Changes in mucosal and venous histamine concentrations during instillation of ethanol in the canine stomach. Histamine concentrations in the gastric mucosa, gastric vein blood, and gastric contents were measured after instillation of 300 ml of 40%, 20% and 12.5%, vol/vol, ethanol intragastrically for 30 min in anesthetized dogs. The mean histamine concentration in the gastric mucosa, gastric vein blood, and gastric contents in dogs treated with 40% ethanol was significantly higher than in dogs treated with sodium chloride (NaCl). Serial studies of the gastric vein blood of the ethanol-treated dogs should significant elevation of histamine concentrations for 2 hr after instillation of 40% ethanol, but less increases at 20 and 30 min after instillation of 12.5% and 20%, respectively. No change was observed after administration of 50% glucose and 25% mannitol. Morphologically, the gastric mucosa of the ethanol-treated dogs was edematous, congested and hemorrhagic. The severity of these changes increased with the concentration used. The mucosa of the dogs treated with sodium chloride, glucose, or mannitol was normal. The factors that may underlie the increase in histamine concentrations in the gastric vein blood and the possible relation of such an increase to the morphologic alterations are discussed.\n",
      "Organic anions induce colinic secretion. Experiments were conducted by instilling test solutions into the cleaned colon of anesthetized rats. Isotonic test solutions at an acid (2.9% or neutral (7.0) pH and containing acetic acid or acetate ions were used. At the lower pH, acetic acid was absorbed well absorbed and the colon absorbed fluid. The secretory effect could not be reproduced by hydrochloric acid solutions at pH 2.9. Fluid secretion induced by acetic acid was associated with discharge of mucus from goblet cells. The interference of colonic absorption by acetic acid might be important in some diarrheal diseases.\n",
      "Residues in antibiotic preparations, i: scanning electron microscopic studies of surface topography. The surface characteristics of residues obtained from several commercial antibiotic products were studied using scanning electron microscopy. The photomicrographs showed the presence of particulates possessing crystalline or amorphous properties with particle sizes ranging from 1 mum to several mum. Small, well-defined, granular crystalline particulates seemed to predominate in residues of products which were processed  under optimum pH conditions. Coalescing or aggregating of small crystalline particles (1-10mum) to form larger masses was interpreted as a sign of instability of the antibiotic. Most of the penicillin and semisynthetic penicillins produced residues that were characterized as amorphous, flaky, bulky and of no distinct shape. Such structures were attributed to the drying of gelatinous particulates. The possible sources and causes of the occurrence of these particulates are discussed. It appears that in many of the products the particulates are product-related rather than process-related, and subtle degradation may be involved. Advice is given to practitioners regarding the preparation, storage and administration of these products.\n",
      "Residues in antibiotic preparations, ii: effect of pH on the nature and level of particulate matter in sodium cephalothin intravenous solutions. The effect of pH on the extent and nature of particulate contamination in sodium cephalothin intravenous solutions was studied. The extent of particulate contamination was determined by microscopic and automatic electronic counting procedures, and the physical nature of the particles was determined using scanning electron microscopy. At low pH values (i.e., 4.9--5.9), an amorphous residue was predominant, while at higher pH values (6.9--7.8), the gelatinous nature of the residue disappeared and small crystalline particulates of varying sizes were predominant. The level of particulate contamination (particles over 10 mum in size) decreased with an increase in pH to a minimum level between pH 7 and 8. Advice is given to practitioners regarding the preparation of sodium cephalothin solutions.\n",
      "Compatibility of penicillin and ascorbic acid injection. The stability of Potassium Penicillin G, USP, when mixed with Ascorbic Acid Injection, USP, in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, was studied. The change in concentration over an eight-hour period of potassium penicillin G in the admixture was determined by the hydroxylamine colorimetric assay method and the microbiological assay method. The stability of penicillin was not adversely affected by the presence of sodium ascorbate. Reports of incompatibilities between penicillin and ascorbic acid are a function of pH rather than a characteristic of the ascorbate ion. Articles reporting studies involving ascorbic acid should specify whether the work refers to the use of ascorbic acid or Ascorbic Acid Injection, USP. Confusion in the literature could be reduced by changing the official title from Ascorbic Acid Injection to Sodium Ascorbate Injection.\n",
      "Self-injurious behavior in schizophrenic and retarded children. Self-injurious behavior  is a problem with some children who are primarily nonverval and low-functioning. This behavior has resulted in management difficulties far out of proportion to its incidence. In the present paper, we have considered possible operant and respondent paradigms instrumental in the acquisition and maintenance of several different topographies of self-injurious behavior. Support for these paradigms was gathered from existing epidemiological literature dealing with humans and primates and from the literature concerned with treatment of self-injurious behavior. Immediate outcome and results of subsequent follow-up were presented as a function of type of intervention, the nature of positive reinforcement utilized, and the topography of the self-injurious response involved. Implications were drawn for future research and treatment.\n",
      "Fetal acid-base balance. I. Interdependence of maternal and fetal PCO2 and bicarbonate concentration. This paper presents the results of measurements of the acid-base and gaseous status of maternal and fetal capillary blood at the time of amniotomy, before the onset of labor. The correlation coefficient between maternal and fetal bicarbonate concentration is 0.6, and that between maternal and fetal PCO2 is 0.31. From the results obtained, as well as from a survey of other work in the field, it is proposed that the diffusion of carbon dioxide across the placenta could not explain some of the findings and that bicarbonate concentrations equilibrate across the placenta.\n",
      "Breathing patterns before death in fetal lambs. Continuous observations in 16 fetal lambs over many days before death in utero from hypoxia, asphyxia, infection, and other causes have shown that death is preceded by variable changes in breathing movements. There was always a prolonged period of apnea succeeded by continuous abnormal breathing in six lambs and by gasping or brief episodes of abnormal breathing in the remainder. These abnormal patterns are described as a warning of what may be encountered in the human fetus.\n",
      "The evaluation of continuous fetal heart rate monitoring in high-risk pregnancy. Intrapartum electronic fetal heart rate monitoring of the high-risk obstetric patient is thought to improve the perinatal outcome. A prospective randomized study of 483 high-risk obstetric patients in labor was carried out comparing the effectiveness of electronic fetal monitoring with auscultation of fetal heart tones. The infant outcome was measured by neonatal death, Apgar scores, cord blood gases, and neonatal nursery morbidity. There were no differences in the infant outcomes in any measured category between the electronically monitored group and the auscultated group. The cesarean section rate was markedly increased in the monitored group (16.5 vs. 6.8 per cent in the auscultated patients). The presumptive benefits of electronic fetal monitoring for improving fetal outcome were not found in this study.\n",
      "Evaluation of redox state of isolated perfused rat lung. The metabolic responsiveness of lung tissue to inhibition of oxidative metabolism was determined by measurement of the redox state of the isolated perfused and ventilated rat lung. Changes in redox state were evaluated by fluorescence from the lung surface at wavelengths suitable for reduced pyridine nucleotides and by measurement of the ratios of redox couples in rapidly frozen lung tissue. Maximal change of redox state was observed during ventilation with carbon monoxide; surface fluorescence increased 6.6%, lactate/pyruvate increased 5.8 times, glycerol 3-P/dihydroxyacetone-P increased fourfold and glutamate/alpha-ketoglutarate doubled. KCN infusion resulted in similar changes. Hypoxia produced with N2 ventilation resulted in less than maximal changes in redox couple ratios until alveolar PO2 was reduced below 0.1 mmHg. Redox changes observed during infusion of 0.5 mM aminoxyacetic acid suggested that maintenance of cytoplasmic redox state depended on functioning of a malate-aspartate \"shuttle.\" The isolated perfused lung appears suitable to study factors controlling pulmonary parenchymal oxidative metabolism. The results emphasize the need for ventilation with CO to establish intracellular anoxia.\n",
      "Altered hepatic glycogen metabolism and glucoregulatory hormones during sepsis. Levels of glucose, insulin, and glucagon in portal vein plasma and of liver glycogen and cyclic AMP and activities of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase in liver were assayed in control (CONT) rats and rats infected (INF) with Diplococcus pneumoniae. In INF rats compared with CONT rats, insulin and glucagon levels were higher (8,12,24 h). Activity of synthase I was lower (8, 12, 24 h) and of phosphorylase higher (12 and 24 h) in INF rats. Cyclic AMP levels were higher in INF rats at 12 and 24 h. Total synthase activity was lower in INF rats at 24 h. Glucose given intravenously increased glycogen less in INF than in CONT rats and activated synthase and inactivated phosphorylase in all animals except at 24 h in INF rats. However, in situ perfusion of the livers at 24 h with glucose in buffer decreased phosphorylase activities in all animals and increased synthase I activities in CONT but not INF rats.\n",
      "Histidine decarboxylase-mediated histamine synthesis in glomeruli from rat kidneys. Enzymatic histamine synthesis by renal glomeruli of the rat has been examined. Assays of the partially purified enzyme demonstrated a pH optimum of 6.2, a Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.4 X 10(-4) histidine, and lack of potentiation by benzene. These data thus indicate that renal glomeruli contain the histidine-specific histidine decarboxylase.\n",
      "Effects of temperature transients on gas exchange and acid-base status of turtles. Pulmonary ventilation (VE), O2 consumption (VO2), and CO2 production (VCO2) were measured continuously on each of 10 turtles, Pseudemys scripta elegans, at 20 degrees C, during and for 1 h after heating to 30 degrees C and during and for 1 h after cooling to 20 degrees C. In seven of the animals, arterial blood was sampled at the three temperature plateaus. Ventilatory ratios (VE/VO2 and VE/VCO2) and metabolic rate adjusted promptly to temperature change, stabilizing at values similar to those observed previously in turtles following 1 day or more at each temperature. Likewise, mean blood pH and PCO2 values conformed both in absolute values and in temperature-dependence to data previously obtained from animals exposed to the various temperatures for longer time periods or from turtle blood thermally equilibrated in vitro. Total plasma [CO2] did not change significantly, suggesting that steady-state CO2 exchange prevailed throughout the experiment. In accordance with this, R(VCO2/VO2) did not change significantly during the 20-30 degrees C transition; however, R rose during the 30-20 degrees C transition, suggesting possible hyperventilation at this stage. We conclude that the respiratory control of blood acid-base status adjusts rapidly to temperature change in the turtle and its adjustment minimizes disturbance to CO2 balance.\n",
      "Direct effects of various catecholamines on liver circulation in dogs. As measured by electromagnetic blood flow transducers, direct infusion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine into the portal vein (PV) produced a 40-50% decrease in hepatic arterial (HA) blood flow; isoproterenol increased HA flow by about 69%. No changes in PV flow or pressure were observed. Direct HA infusion of the vasoconstrictors decreased HA flow by amounts comparable to those occurring after PV infusion. However, HA infusion of isoproterenol increased HA flow only 15% suggesting a difference in beta-receptor population in the two vessels. When infused directly into the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), epinephrine and norepinephrine reduced SMA flow by about 45% and PV flow by 20-25%; HA flow increased 6-8%. Infusion of isoproterenol and dopamine into SMA increased SMA flow by 115% and 206% and PV flow by 60% and 70%, respectively, whereas HA flow decreased by 25% and 50%. Portal vein pressure increased less than 3 mmHg. Alpha- and beta-receptor blockade of the liver did not change significantly the alterations in hepatic arterial blood flow that were secondary to changes in portal venous blood flow. It is likely that regulation of hepatic arterial flow resides in mechanisms located within the liver sinusoids.\n",
      "Clinical response and plasma levels: effect of dose, dosage schedules, and drug interactions on plasma chlorpromazine levels. Plasma chlorpromazine (CPZ) levels of 50 psychotic inpatients were measured by gas liquid chromatography; the clinical progress of 29 of these patients with acute psychoses was also assessed. CPZ levels of 50-300 ng/ml were usually associated with clinical improvement; there was also a relationship between CPZ levels and increases in certain symptoms. The 50-300 ng/ml level was best attained by doses of 400-800 mg/day. Trihexyphenidyl decreased plasma CPZ by a mean of 44.7% in 12 of 15 patients. A single 400-800-mg dose of CPZ at bedtime produced steady states equal to or better than those achieved with multiple doses. Those patients who failed to attain CPZ levels of more than 70 ng/ml despite doses of 400-1000 mg/day were receiving lithium throughout the study and had discharge diagnoses of manic-depressive psychosis, manic type, and schizo-affective schizophrenia--a finding with implications for future research.\n",
      "Accidental hypothermia: core rewarming with partial bypass. Three patients with profound hypothermia were treated by rewarming on partial bypass. Two surivived and have normal mental and metabolic functions. The resuscitation of the hypothermic patient should be approached with enthusiasm since the outcome is often much better than expected from initial vital signs and neurologic examination. To avoid ventricular fibrillation the patient should be handled gently and an effort should be made to keep the patient well oxygenated and the pH normal. Blood gases should be measured often and corrected for temperature. The potassium concentration and hydration status of the patient should also be monitored closely. The rewarming of profoundly hypothermic patients can readily be accomplished with a pump oxygenator and heat exchanger. The indications for this method are not established from our small experience and the few cases reported in the literature. Certainly ventricular fibrillation is a compelling indication. Patients with frozen extremities might also benefit from this method since theoretically tissue salvage would be increased. Finally, those patients who do not respond rapidly to external rewarming may be at less risk of ventricular fibrillation if rewarmed on bypass.\n",
      "Premedicant drugs and gastric juice pH and volume in pediatric patients. The effects of premedication on gastric juice volume and pH were evaluated in five groups of 206 pediatric patients undergoing elective surgical procedures: Group 1 (Control) received no premedication; Group 2 was given morphine sulfate and pentobarbital as premedicants. The other groups received, in addition to morphine and pentobarbital, atropine (Group 3), scopolamine (Group 4), or glycopyrrolate (Group 5). After endotracheal intubation, gastric aspirates were examined for volume, pH and color. Neither premedication with morphine and pentobarbital nor addition of atropine or scopolamine to the premedication significantly altered volume. In patients treated with glycopyrrolate, volume was reduced to less than a third of that of patients in Group 1 (P less than 0.001), and the percentage of pH's higher than 2.5 was significantly greater than in other groups. The incidences of unobtainable samples and samples with pH's higher than 2.5 were greatest with atropine (32.0 per cent, P less than 0.05) and glycopyrrolate (58.1 per cent, P less than 0.01). In 60 per cent of the bile-stained specimens, pH's were below 2.5. It is concluded that because of its selective inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretions, glycopyrrolate appears superior to other anticholinergic drugs. The reduction of gastric juice volume and acidity produced by glycopyrrolate would have important clinical implications in case of accidental aspiration. It is also concluded that bile staining of gastric contents is not a reliable indicator of gastric juice pH.\n",
      "Arterial hypoxemia caused by intravenous ketamine. Ketamine given IV in a dose of 2 mg/kg caused a significant reduction in Pao2 in 7 patients spontaneously breathing with an unassisted airway. Under the same conditions, in 7 patients, ketamine (2 mg/kg IV) preceded by diazepam (0.2 mg/kg IV) also caused a reduction in Pao2 not significantly different from that caused by ketamine. In some patients, alarmingly low levels of Pao2 ( less than or equal to 40 torr) were seen following ketamine administration. Based on these findings, the authors recommend that O2 and ventilatory assistance accompany ketamine given IV for anesthesia.\n",
      "Clinical investigation of a new intravenous anesthetic--etoxadrol hydrochloride (CL-1848; U-37862A). Twenty-eight patients were anesthetized with etoxadrol as primary agent. The anesthesia produced was characterized by profound analgesia and amnesia, while pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes, as well as swallowing and lid reflexes, remained active. Systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure were slightly increased, with associated tachycardia and tachypnea. A dose of 0.75 mg/kg produced anesthesia for an average of 26 (14 to 53) minutes. Alternating nystagmus was present for several hours and associated with dreams and/or visions that were pleasing to most patients. Six patients, however, had unpleasant dreams for up to 24 hours. One patient given an excessive dose (4.65 mg/kg) was cataleptic, amnesic, and analgesic for 6 days. The occurrence of unpleasant dreams and aberrations in over 20% of the patients suggests that the drug probably has little usefulness in anesthesia. However, the extreme safety of the drug (an LD50 equal to some 20 to 40 times the ED50) and the prolonged analgesia justified clinical testing. There was no evidence of metabolic or systemic organ system change from any of the clinical laboratory studies.\n",
      "The effect of enflurane, isoflurane, fluroxene, methoxyflurane and diethyl ether anesthesia on ouabain tolerance in the dog. Digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with enflurane, isoflurane, fluroxene, methoxyflurane, and diethyl ether was compared with that in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Ouabain dosage needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher than that of pentobarbital with all agents except fluroxene, as was the LD50. The relative potency of these anesthetics in converting ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm, in order of descending effectiveness, was: diethyl ether, methoxyflurane, enflurane, fluroxene, isoflurane, pentobarbital.\n",
      "An evaluation of memory under regional anesthesia with IV lorazepam as a premedicant. Forty male volunteer patients undergoing regional anesthesia were evaluated for alertness and memory in a double-blind study which compared IV lorazepam (4 mg) plus IM meperidine (50 mg) with IV placebo plus IM meperidine (50 mg) as premedicants. The data indicate no significant retrograde effects. Significant differences at all measurement points from 20 minutes to 3 hours following IV drug administration indicated greater sedation and less recall and recognition of events and stimuli (auditory and visual) with the combination of lorazepam and meperidine than with placebo and meperidine. A significant number of patients over age 40 were judged to be excessively sedated after administration of lorazepam. However, respiration, blood pressure, and pulse did not appear to be differentially affected by lorazepam and there were no adverse changes even in patients considered to be oversedated.\n",
      "[2 cases of chylothorax caused by catheterization of left large venous trunks]. The authors present two cases of almost certain catheterization of the thoracic duct, by infusion catheters placed in the large veins at the base of the neck (once in the left internal jugular, once in the left subclavian). Their clinical manifestaztions are the existence of a rapidly progressive pleural effusion, apart from the abnormal course of the catheter. Removal of the catheter is sufficient to lead to the disappearance of the symptomatology, so that it is difficult to speak of an accident as such, but rather of an incident. These incidents could be avoided by systematic radiography from the time that the catheter is placed in position or the positioning of the latter under control by brilliance amplifier.\n",

      "[Enzyme system and coenzymes involved in the energy metabolism of leukocytes. Function and metabolism of polymorphonuclear neutrophils]. Mitochondria may be isolated from various types of leukocyte (neutrophil polymorphs and lymphocytes from human blood, neutrophil polymorphs and macrophages from peritoneal exudates of the guinea pig) after destruction by heparin of the cell membrane. This procedure is very simple and less traumatic for these subcellular structures than the usual mechanical procedures. The enzyme activities of the respiratory chain and oxygen consumption may be measured in these mitochondrial preparations. The oxygen consumption is determined using oxyhemoglobin which serves both as oxygen donor, as in the respiratory system in vivo, and as indicator of the reaction at 435.8 nm. The integrity of the mitochondria may be demonstrated by determination of the \"acceptor control index\", the existence of ADP phosphorylation coupled with oxygen consumption (phosphorylating oxidation) was proved in all the cells studied even if the ADP/O ratio can only be calculated for certain of them (lymphocytes, macrophages). In these cases, the ratios obtained are close to theoretical values whatever the oxidation substrate used. The mitochondria of leukemic cells have a higher oxidation activity than the corresponding reference cells. Determination of leukocyte coenzymes by enzyme cycling (NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH) showed the following facts: -- Generally, the NAD concentrations remain constant, those of NADH increase whilst those of NADP and NADPH fall during incubation of neutrophil polymorphs in Dulbecco's medium. -- The metabolic changes observed during S. albi heat-induced endocytosis are in favour of simultaneous stimulation of NADH oxidase and NADPH oxidase in human polymorphs, and of NADPH oxidase in the corresponding cells of peritoneal exudates in guinea pigs.\n",
      "[Use of the Cessna 206 for medical evacuations]. The CESSNA 206 aircraft belonging to the National Police Force has been used to effect medical evacuations. After describing the specifications of this aircraft and underlining its advantages (speed, autonomy, cost price) and its disadvantages (very small cabin, necessity of prepared landing grounds, sound level) compared with the helicopter generally used in similar circumstances, the authors conclude that this new aircraft could be used to advantage for evacuating medium-serious cases over distances greater than 200 kilometer provided that the cabin was modified. Even more than with the helicopter, the pilot must remain the judge concerning the technical flying possibilities of the aircraft, which is not pressurized and which has no defrosting equipment.\n",

In this work carried out at the Traumatology Centre in Strasbourg, out of 227 patients operated for a fracture situated between the pelvis and the tibial plateau, the authors endeavoured to show a thrombosis of the lower limbs. The means of exploration included in addition to the clinical and biological blood tests an isotopic, rheographic and phlebographic surveillance. The latter three ways of exploration are particularly viewed in this study, during which it was possible to demonstrate 44 p. 100 thrombo-embolic manifestations of which 38 p. 100 were detected only by the isotopic method, the phlebographic check for its part confirming 80 p. 100 of the clinically undeclared cases of thrombosis.\n",
      "Detection of mutant hemoglobins with altered affinity for oxygen. A simplified technique. The detection of high- or low-affinity hemoglobins in subjects with polycythemia or anemia is difficult for most physicians because of the requirement for special equipment to do oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curves. Measurement of the pH, oxygen tension, and oxygen saturation of antecubital venous blood with instruments present in most clinical chemistry laboratories permits an estimate of the strength of oxygen binding to hemoglobin. An equation can be used to convert the venous oxygen tension (standardized to pH 7.4) and the oxygen saturation to the P50 of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve on which the observed point falls. The data indicate that this method is a reliable initial step in the identification of a hemoglobin with abnormal affinity for oxygen and may be applied to population studies, since reliable results are obtained with venous blood stored at 4 degrees C for up to 24 hours.\n",

Diagnosis and treatment were practically siumultaneous. Aspiration of the lipid solution (450 ml) via the catheter confirmed the diagnosis and successfully treated the problem. With regard to the case, the following are discussed: - diagnostic features of acute tamponnade (acetiological, clinical, heemodynamic, electrocardiographic and radiological signs); - the physiopathological mechanism of tamponnade with changes in intra-pericardiac and ventricular pressure/volume cures; - finally, the management of tamponnade.\n",
      "RNA-protein interactions in alfalfa mosaic virus. Particles of the bottom component of alfalfa mosaic virus have a compact bacilliform structure at neutral pH. When the pH is raised to 8.3 the structure unfolds. Since the particle weight does not change it is concluded that the protein subunits remain attached to the RNA. The particle weight of the spheroidal top component a of the virus is halved when the particles unfold at pH 8.3. This can be explained by the fact that these particles contain two RNA molecules of identical size. Free RNA molecules of alfalfa mosaic virus are able to withdraw protein subunits from intact particles of the virus. It is demonstrated that per RNA molecule there are a few sites with a high affinity for coat protein. Possibly these are the sites where the coat protein plays its role in activating the genome.\n",
      "Human enolase isozymes: electrophoretic and biochemical evidence for three loci. 1. Four major enolase isozymes have been identified in human tissues and are referred to as L, M, 'intermediate' and 'fast'. The M isozyme is the major form found in skeletal muscle and heart extracts and the L isozyme the major form found in extracts of liver and most other tissues. The 'intermediate' and 'fast' isozymes are most active in brain but are observed as weak components in most other tissues including heart but are not seen in skeletal muscle. It was observed that during fetal development of heart and skeletal muscle the L form declines in activity while the M form increases in activity. 2. The kinetic properties, heat stabilities and molecular sizes of the main enolase isozymes have been compared. Although the isozymes share many features in common, the 'fast' isozyme is more stable when subjected to heat treatment than either the L or M isozymes. Further, the 'fast' isozyme retains its dimeric structure and activity in the absence of magnesium ions while the L and M isozymes dissociate and lose activity. The 'intermediate' isozyme has properties which are intermediate to those of the L and 'fast' isozymes. 3. The 'intermediate' isozyme can be partially dissociated to equal quantities of L and 'fast' isozymes by storage at room temperature or by freezing and thawing in the presence of 2 M-NaCl. Conversely, mixtures of L with 'fast' and M with 'fast' give rise to an 'intermediate' isozyme after freezing and thawing. 4. Evidence derived from this study has led to the suggestion that three separate gene loci are involved in the determination of human enolase. It is proposed that one of these, ENO1, determines the L isozyme which is the homodimer alphaalpha; another locus, ENO2, determines the 'fast' isozyme which is the homodiner betabeta; and the third locus, ENO3, determines the M isozyme which is the homodimer gammagamma. The 'intermediate' isozyme seen as a strong component in brain and as a weak component in most other tissues is thought to be the heterodimer alphabeta. In heart however it is probably mainly betagamma.\n",
      "Adenylate kinases in man: evidence for a third locus. The tissue distribution of the adenylate kinase isozymes in man has been examined using various substrates. The isozymes attributable to the AK1 and AK2 loci were identified, and an additional set of isozymes probably attributable to a third locus was also found. This locus has been provisionally designated AK3. The AK3 isozymes show activity with either GTP + AMP or ITP + AMP but do not show activity with ATP + AMP. They also differ from the AK1 and AK2 isozymes in electrophoretic mobility and from the AK1 isozymes in being resistant to silver inhibition. They are similar in molecular size to the AK1 isozymes whereas the AK2 isozymes are apparently larger. The AK3 isozymes evidently correspond to the enzyme nucleosidetriphosphate-adenylate kinase (2.7.4.10). Somatic cell hybrid studies indicate that the AK3 locus is not syntenic with that of AK2 (chromosome 1). The AK3 locus is however, probably syntenic with the AK1 locus, on chromosome 9. Genetically determined variation of AK3 has not been seen in a survey of about 80 individuals.\n",
      "[Criteria for evaluating calcium carbonate from the point of view of chlortetracycline biosynthesis]. Calcium carbonate is added to fermentation media in biosynthesis of tetracyclines for providing definite pH values and binding tetracycline into insoluble complexes. Seven different samples were studied with respect to their physical properties, such as the microscopic size of the particles, their form, capacity for agglomeration, specific volume, rate of the particle precipitation and chemical properties, such as purity, buffer capacity, effect on the medium pH before and after sterilization. The above properties were studied in comparison with activity chlortetracycline biosynthesis. Microfine calcium carbonate proved to be the best from the point of view of productivity of Str. aureofaciens. With its use the activity of the culture fluid increased by 20 per cent as compared to the other samples. The titration curve of the sample had the lowest bend.\n",
      "[Study of the penicillin amidase from E. coli. An ultrasonic method of studying the ph- and temperature-conformational transitions in the active center of the enzyme]. pH and temperature conformation transitions in the active center of penicillin amidase i.e. penicillinamidohydrolase E.C. 3.5.I.II were investigated by means of the kinetic method and a new ultrasonic method. It was shown that the catalytic activity of the enzyme was controlled by 2 ionogenic groups with pK 6.1 and 10.2. The study of penicillinamidase by means of the ultrasonic method showed that the ionogenic group with pK 10 was responsible for maintaining the catalytically active conformation of the enzyme active center. Investigation of the temperature relation between the kinetic parameters of the enzymatic hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin catalyzed by penicillin amidase and the data on the effect of ultrasound on the enzyme showed that the enzyme was subjected to the temperature conformation transiton. The temperature and thermodynamic parameters of the conformation transition were determinded (T=318 degrees K, delta H=81 kcal/mole and delta S=255 e.u.). The structure of the active center of the enzyme is discussed on the basis of the data obtained.\n",
      "[Chromatographic control of the process of rifamycin B isolation and purification]. A method of chromatography in a thin layer of Silica Cel No. 2 was developed for rifamicin B, rifamicin complex and some admixtures. Extracts of rifamicin B in an organic solvent, aqueous buffer reextracts and dry preparations of rifamicin B were analyzed with the above method. A half-quantitative chromatographic procedure for estimation of the main admixture in dry preparations was proposed.\n",
      "Regulatory mast cells. I Suppressive action of their products on an in vitro primary immune reaction. Products of mast cell degranulation, as well as histamine and serotonin, were added to a Mishell and Dutton preparation for in vitro primary immunisation (induction of IgM antibody formation) to sheep or horse red blood cells. Degranulation products were either obatined beforehand by reacting passively sensitised mast cells with the corresponding antigen (unrelated to or identical with the in vitro immunising antigen) or liberated into the culture medium where mast cells actively sensitised to the in vitro immunising antigen had been added. A 46 to 72 % reduction of direct (IgM) plaque forming cells was observed in all cases. This reduction was prevented by anti-histamine. The responsible mediators were active in the 0 to 24 hour period after antigen introduction. The anaphylactic degranulating antibodies triggering this inhibitory activity were found to be thermolabile in one experiment. An in vivo-induced mast cell degranulation led to a reduced formation of plaque forming cells. The enhancing and immunoregulatory activity of anaphylactic mouse antibodies is therefore tentatively and at least partially attributed to their capacity to degranulate mast cells after contact with the antigen.\n",
      "[Relationship between the antibacterial activity and the acceptor properties of certain penicillins]. Antibacterial activity of 2 natural and 12 semisynthetic penicillins against 5 strains of grampositive bacteria was determined and quantum chemical estimation of their molecules was performed with the Hukkel method. The data were indicative of the fact that antibacterial activity of the penicillins was connected with the acceptor properties of their molecules.\n",
      "[Effect of different factors on the rate of benzylpenicillin conversion in an aqueous system-butylacetate system]. It was shown that the mass-transfer coefficient of non-dissociated benzylpenicillin during extraction was more than 1000 times higher than that during reextraction. For the latter it was found that the aqueous phase exerted limiting resistance during mass-transfer of benzylpenicillin. The effect of a number of factors on the kinetics was shown. These factors were the following: hydrodynamic conditions, temperature, pH of the aqueous phase.\n",
      "[Regulation of tetracycline biosynthesis by controlling the growth of the producer]. Regulation of the rate growth of Act. aureofaciens in batch fermentation by maintaining the concentrations of phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, glucose and pH values at the levels favourable for intensive growth at the beginning of the process and after accumulation of the biomass at the levels optimal for retarded growth of the organism resulted in significant prolongation of the period of intensive antibiotic production, i.e. intensification of the fermentation process. Microscopic investigation of the organism development under conditions of regulated fermentation revealed the presence of significant amounts of free peripheral highly basophilic hyphae for a prolonged period of time. The hyphae possessed a capacity for growth and intensive metabolism unlike the control culture which was liable to early autolysis.\n",
      "[Study of the biosynthesis of a carbohydrate fragment of rubomycin]. When the rubomycin-producing organism was grown in the presence of an evenly labeled C14-glucose and various non-labeled carbon sources, the carbohydrate part of the antibiotic also became evently labeled. The activity of I carbon atom of rubomycin sugar grown against the background of non-labeled glycerol was almost 3 times higher than the respective value of the aglycone activity. C14-acetate, C14-propionate, C14-methionine and daunosamine were not incorporated. The data are indicative of the fact that there was no splitting of the glucose carbon skeleton during conversion of glucose into amino sugar.\n",
      "[Physicochemical properties of 7-phenylacetamidodesacetoxy-cephalosporanic acid]. 7-phenylacetamidodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid was prepared by transformation of benzylpenicillin. The acid was subjected to potentiometric titration and investigation of its electrophoretic mobility at wide pH ranges. The data of the potentiometric titration and electrophoresis were used for calculation of the acid ionization constant. Minimum solubility of the acid was determined and the curve of its solubility at wide pH ranges was estimated.\n",
      "Beta-glucosidase of Trichoderma: its biosynthesis and role in saccharification of cellulose. The extracellular beta-glucosidase of Trichoderma viride generally is present in low levels when the organism is cultured on cellulose because it is inactivated under the acid conditions which develop in the medium while the other enzymes of the cellulase complex are more stable. With the appropriate pH control, inactivation of beta-glucosidase is prevented and the activity of this enzyme increases during growth. In the saccharification of crystalline cellulose, or of cellulose at low concentrations, much of the glucose produced is the result of the cleavage of cellobiose by beta-glucosidase. However when high concentrations (10%) of pretreated cellulose are saccharified, significant quantities of glucose are produced by action of enzymes other than beta-glucosidase.\n",
      "Growth of Fusarium moniliforme on carob aqueous extract and nutritional evaluation of its biomass. Fusarium moniliforme was cultured semicontinuously on a carob medium in a 14-liter fermentor (8.5-liter working volume). The growth medium provided 2.4% carob sugar, 0.72% NH4H2PO4, and 0.03% MgSO4-7H2O. The biomass harvest was 8.8 g/liter per day. Ninety percent of the sugars were consumed, and the pH dropped from 5.9 to about 3.7. The crude protein (N X 6.25) of the spray-dried mycelium was 380 g/kg, 300 g/kg for the true protein (Lowry), and 4.8 g/kg for the (Folin-Denis) tannic acid. The mycelium was evaluated nutritionally with the weanling rat as experimental animal. The protein efficiency ratio and net protein utilization values for the unsupplemented mycelium were 1.15 and 0.42, respectively, and for the mycelium supplemented with DL-methionine (5 g/kg) they were 2.31 and 0.72, respectively. No growth depression was observed in the experimental rats, and on dissection of the carcasses the internal organs were found to be normal.\n"
